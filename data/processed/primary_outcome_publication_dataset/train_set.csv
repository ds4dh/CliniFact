The goal of this study was to develop and evaluate a multidimentional measure of internalized HIV stigma that captures stigma related to treatment and other aspects of the disease among sociodemographically diverse PLHA. We developed a 28-item measure of internalized HIV stigma composed of four scales based on previous qualitative work. Internal consistency reliability estimates in a sample of 202 PLHA was 0.93 for the overall measure, and exceeded 0.85 for three of the four stigma scales. Items discriminated well across scales, and correlations of the scales with shame, social support, and mental health supported construct validity. This measure should prove useful to investigators examining in the role of stigma in HIV treatment and health outcomes, and evaluating interventions designed to mitigate the impacts of stigma on PLHA.",2,PRIMARY,Continuous Adherence,Percentage of doses taken of those prescribed from electronic monitoring.

Research has demonstrated that contextual errors can be identified using standardized patients.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate an educational intervention designed to increase physicians' skills in incorporating the patient's context in assessment and management of care and to thereby decrease the rate of contextual errors.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Quasi-randomized controlled trial, with assessments by blinded observers. Fourth-year medical students (n = 124) in internal medicine subinternships at the University of Illinois at Chicago or Jesse Brown Veterans Administration Medical Center between July 2008 and April 2009 and between August 2009 and April 2010 participated and were assessed.
INTERVENTION: A 4-hour course on contextualization.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Probing for contextual issues in an encounter, probing for medical issues in an encounter, and developing an appropriate treatment plan. Outcomes were assessed using 4 previously validated standardized patient encounters performed by each participant and were adjusted for subinternship site, academic year, time of year, and case scenario.
RESULTS: Students who participated in the contextualization workshops were significantly more likely to probe for contextual issues in the standardized patient encounters than students who did not (90% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 87%-94% ] vs 62% [95% CI, 54%-69%], respectively) and significantly more likely to develop appropriate treatment plans for standardized patients with contextual issues (69% [95% CI, 57%-81%] vs 22% [95% CI, 12%-32%]. There was no difference between the groups in the rate of probing for medical issues (80% [95% CI, 75%-85%] vs 81% [95% CI, 76%-86%]) or developing appropriate treatment plans for standardized patients with medical issues (54% [95% CI, 42%-67%] vs 66% [95% CI, 53%-79%]).

The sample was predominantly minority, and many reported drug and mental health problems as well as housing instability. At baseline, roughly half of the participants were engaged in HIV primary care; the other participants were either not at all engaged in HIV primary care or somewhat engaged in care. Those who were somewhat engaged in care were very similar to those who were not at all engaged in care, and significantly different than those who were fully engaged in care across a number of demographic, health status/utilization, and barriers to care items and fared equally poorly with regard to engagement in care at 12-month follow-up. In 12-month longitudinal analyses, 58% of those not engaged at baseline ( n = 517) became more fully engaged in care. In the final multivariate model that controlled for disease stage, decreases in drug use, structural barriers, and unmet needs were associated with engagement in care.

Real-time functional MRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) offers a non-invasive method to modulate this regional activity. We examined whether depressed participants can use rtfMRI-nf to enhance amygdala responses to positive autobiographical memories, and whether this ability alters symptom severity.
METHODS: Unmedicated MDD subjects were assigned to receive rtfMRI-nf from either left amygdala (LA; experimental group, n = 14) or the horizontal segment of the intraparietal sulcus (HIPS; control group, n = 7) and instructed to contemplate happy autobiographical memories (AMs) to raise the level of a bar representing the hemodynamic signal from the target region to a target level. This 40s Happy condition alternated with 40s blocks of rest and counting backwards. A final Transfer run without neurofeedback information was included.
RESULTS: Participants in the experimental group upregulated their amygdala responses during positive AM recall. Significant pre-post scan decreases in anxiety ratings and increases in happiness ratings were evident in the experimental versus control group. A whole brain analysis showed that during the transfer run, participants in the experimental group had increased activity compared to the control group in left superior temporal gyrus and temporal polar cortex, and right thalamus.
CONCLUSIONS: Using rtfMRI-nf from the left amygdala during recall of positive AMs, depressed subjects were able to self-regulate their amygdala response, resulting in improved mood.

This multicenter phase 3 study (SP1037; NCT01646255) was the first to investigate the efficacy and safety of rotigotine in Chinese patients with advanced-stage PD.
METHODS: Chinese patients with PD, inadequately controlled on levodopa (stable dose ≥200 mg/day), with ≥2.5 h/day ""off"" time, and Hoehn & Yahr stage 2-4, were randomized 1:1 to receive transdermal rotigotine or placebo, titrated over ≤7 weeks, maintained at optimal/maximum dose (4-16 mg/24 h) for 12 weeks. Primary efficacy variable: mean change in absolute ""off"" time (according to patient diaries) from baseline to end of maintenance. Safety variables included adverse events (AEs) and discontinuations due to AEs.
RESULTS: 346 patients were randomized and 89.9% completed the study (87.8% placebo; 92.0% rotigotine). All were Chinese (58.7% male; mean ± SD age: 62.2 ± 8.9 years; mean ± SD time since PD diagnosis: 6.62 ± 3.70 years). Rotigotine significantly reduced ""off"" time vs placebo (LS mean [95% CI] treatment difference: -1.20 h/day [-1.83, -0.57]; p = 0.0002), and resulted in more responders (≥30% decrease in ""off"" time: 36.9% placebo; 48.8% rotigotine; p = 0.0269). AEs were reported for 86 (50.0%) placebo- and 103 (59.2%) rotigotine-treated patients; 15 discontinued due to AEs (placebo 7; rotigotine 8). The most common AEs (≥5%) were dizziness, nausea, pruritus, and dyskinesia.
CONCLUSIONS: Rotigotine was efficacious in Chinese patients with advanced-stage PD as add-on therapy to levodopa, significantly reducing ""off"" time vs placebo; the treatment difference was similar to that observed in previous studies of mainly Caucasian patients.

METHODS: This multicenter, double-blind randomized controlled trial compared the efficacy and safety of SARS-CoV-2 high titer convalescent plasma to placebo control plasma in symptomatic adults ≥18 years positive for SARS-CoV-2 regardless of risk factors for disease progression or vaccine status. Participants with symptom onset within 8 days were enrolled, then transfused within the subsequent day. The measured primary outcome was COVID-19-related hospitalization within 28 days of plasma transfusion. The enrollment period was June 3, 2020 to October 1, 2021.
RESULTS: A total of 1225 participants were randomized and 1181 transfused. In the pre-specified modified intention-to-treat analysis that excluded those not transfused, the primary endpoint occurred in 37 of 589 (6.3%) who received placebo control plasma and in 17 of 592 (2.9%) participants who received convalescent plasma (relative risk, 0.46; one-sided 95% upper bound confidence interval 0.733; P=0.004) corresponding to a 54% risk reduction. Examination with a model adjusting for covariates related to the outcome did not change the conclusions.
CONCLUSION: Early administration of high titer SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma reduced outpatient hospitalizations by more than 50%. High titer convalescent plasma is an effective early outpatient COVID-19 treatment with the advantages of low cost, wide availability, and rapid resilience to variant emergence from viral genetic drift in the face of a changing pandemic.

However, we are not aware of any study directly comparing the commonly used combination of a continuous femoral block given with a single-shot sciatic block with that of a periarticular injection after TKA.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: This randomized clinical trial compared a combined femoral and sciatic nerve block with periarticular injection as part of a multimodal pain protocol after total knee arthroplasty with respect to (1) pain; (2) narcotic use; (3) quadriceps function and length of stay; and (4) peripheral nerve complications.
METHODS: One hundred sixty patients completed randomization into two treatment arms: (1) peripheral nerve blocks (PNB; n=79) with an indwelling femoral nerve catheter and a single shot sciatic block; or (2) periarticular injection (PAI; n=81) using ropivacaine, epinephrine, ketorolac, and morphine. All patients received standardized general anesthesia and oral medications. The primary outcome was postoperative pain, on a 0 to 10 scale, measured on the afternoon of postoperative day 1 (POD 1). Secondary outcomes were narcotic use, quadriceps function, length of stay, and peripheral nerve complications.
RESULTS: Mean pain scores on the afternoon of POD 1 were not different between groups (PNB group: 2.9 [SD 2.4]; PAI group: 3.0 [SD 2.2]; 95% confidence interval, -0.8 to 0.6; p=0.76). Mean pain scores taken at three times points on POD 1 were also similar between groups. Hospital length of stay was shorter for the PAI group (2.44 days [SD 0.65] versus 2.84 days [SD 1.34] for the PNB group; p=0.02). Narcotic consumption was higher the day of surgery for the PAI group (PAI group: 11.7 mg morphine equivalents [SD 13.1]; PNB group: 4.6 mg [SD 9.1]; p<0.001), but thereafter, there was no difference. More patients in the PNB group had sequelae of peripheral nerve injury (mainly dysesthesia) at 6-week followup (nine [12%] versus one [1%]; p=0.009).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients receiving periarticular injections had similar pain scores, shorter lengths of stay, less likelihood of peripheral nerve dysesthesia, but greater narcotic use on the day of surgery compared with patients receiving peripheral nerve blocks. Periarticular injections provide adequate pain relief, are simple to use, and avoid the potential complications associated with nerve blocks.

8965,NCT04560374,"Experimental Group is equivalent to Control Group in terms of Neonate Infant Pain Scale Score Before the procedure (0th minute), during the procedure, after the procedure (2nd and 10th minutes)",20926970,Reducing neonatal pain during routine heel lance procedures.,"PURPOSE: To measure the difference in pain scores for newborns who were held and swaddled while undergoing routine heel lance procedures compared to newborns who were lying on their backs and not swaddled during heel lance. Additionally, we sought to compare the total amount of time it took to collect the specimens in each group.
DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 42 neonates recruited from a large tertiary hospital were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial. Infants in the experimental group (n = 22) were swaddled and held in an upright position during routine heel lance procedures while neonates in the control group (n = 20) remained in a standard care position. Pain was measured with the Neonatal Inventory Pain Scale (NIPS) at two points in time for each group (just before the heel lance procedure and at the completion of the heel lance). Total collection time was measured using a stopwatch accurate to 1/100th of a second. Specimen quality was measured based on the number of rejected specimens for each group. Descriptive statistics and t tests were used to analyze the data.
RESULTS: The mean NIPS score for neonates who were swaddled and held during the procedure (experimental group) was significantly lower (M = 1.3, SD = .9) than the score for infants in the standard position (control group) (M = 2.7, SD = 1.3), t (40) = -4.48, p < .001. Although the total collection time was lower for infants who were swaddled (2 minutes and 17 seconds, SD = 59) versus (2 minutes and 47 seconds, SD = 85) for controls, this was not a statistically significant difference (p = .45).
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Swaddling combined with positioning neonates upright during routine heel lance procedures offers nurses a nonpharmacologic method of neonatal pain reduction for heel sticks. This technique can be easily implemented on any unit independent of facility protocols. Furthermore, the technique is not associated with any cost or policy development, making it more likely that nurses can use it in practice.",2,PRIMARY,Neonate Infant Pain Scale Score,"Neonate Infant Pain Scale score calculated before, durring and after heel lance procedure whom neonates delivered crochet octopus and not delivered crochet octopus.

We report a post hoc subgroup analysis of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) enrolled in KEYNOTE-181 in Asia, including patients from the KEYNOTE-181 China extension study.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred and forty Asian patients with advanced/metastatic ESCC were enrolled in KEYNOTE-181, including the China cohort. Patients were randomly assigned 1 : 1 to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks for ≤2 years or investigator's choice of paclitaxel, docetaxel, or irinotecan. OS, progression-free survival, response, and safety were analyzed without formal comparisons. OS was evaluated based on PD-L1 CPS expression level.
RESULTS: In Asian patients with ESCC, median OS was 10.0 months with pembrolizumab and 6.5 months with chemotherapy [hazard ratio (HR), 0.63; 95% CI 0.50-0.80; nominal P < 0.0001]. Median progression-free survival was 2.3 months with pembrolizumab and 3.1 months with chemotherapy (HR, 0.79; 95% CI 0.63-0.99; nominal P = 0.020). Objective response rate was 17.1% with pembrolizumab and 7.1% with chemotherapy; median duration of response was 10.5 months and 7.7 months, respectively. In patients with PD-L1 CPS <1 tumors (pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy), the HR was 0.99 (95% CI 0.56-1.72); the HR (95% CI) for death was better for patients with PD-L1 CPS cut-offs >1 [CPS ≥1, 0.57 (0.44-0.75); CPS ≥5, 0.56 (0.41-0.76); CPS ≥10, 0.53 (0.37-0.75)]. Treatment-related adverse events were reported in 71.8% of patients in the pembrolizumab group and 89.8% in the chemotherapy group; grade 3-5 events were reported in 20.0% and 44.6%, respectively.

Physical inactivity is a primary cause of most chronic diseases. The initial third of the article considers: activity and prevention definitions; historical evidence showing physical inactivity is detrimental to health and normal organ functional capacities; cause versus treatment; physical activity and inactivity mechanisms differ; gene-environment interaction (including aerobic training adaptations, personalized medicine, and co-twin physical activity); and specificity of adaptations to type of training. Next, physical activity/exercise is examined as primary prevention against 35 chronic conditions [accelerated biological aging/premature death, low cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max), sarcopenia, metabolic syndrome, obesity, insulin resistance, prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, coronary heart disease, peripheral artery disease, hypertension, stroke, congestive heart failure, endothelial dysfunction, arterial dyslipidemia, hemostasis, deep vein thrombosis, cognitive dysfunction, depression and anxiety, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, balance, bone fracture/falls, rheumatoid arthritis, colon cancer, breast cancer, endometrial cancer, gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, polycystic ovary syndrome, erectile dysfunction, pain, diverticulitis, constipation, and gallbladder diseases]. The article ends with consideration of deterioration of risk factors in longer-term sedentary groups; clinical consequences of inactive childhood/adolescence; and public policy. In summary, the body rapidly maladapts to insufficient physical activity, and if continued, results in substantial decreases in both total and quality years of life.

We evaluated whether HBeAg seroconversion induced by interferon alfa improves clinical outcome.
METHODS: We studied prospectively a cohort of 103 patients treated with interferon alfa for chronic hepatitis B; the mean (+/- SD) follow-up was 50.0 +/- 19.8 months. Fifty-three untreated patients served as controls.
RESULTS: After treatment with interferon alfa, 53 of 103 patients no longer had detectable HBeAg or hepatitis B virus DNA, although only 10 patients became seronegative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (Kaplan-Meier estimates of cumulative clearance rates at five years, 56.0 percent for HBeAg and 11.6 percent for HBsAg). Of the 53 untreated patients, only 7 spontaneously eliminated HBeAg (28.1 percent at five years), and all remained positive for HBsAg (p < 0.001 for the Comparison with the treated patients, by the proportional-hazards model). During follow-up, 6 of the 103 treated patients died of liver failure, and 2 needed liver transplantation, all 8 were persistently positive for HBeAg. In another eight treated patients, complications of cirrhosis developed; all but one of these patients remained positive for HBeAg. Overall survival and survival without clinical complications were significantly longer in patients who were seronegative for HBeAg after therapy with interferon alfa than in those who remained seropositive (P = 0.004 and P = 0.018, respectively). In a regression analysis, clearance of HBeAg was the strongest predictor of survival. Of the 53 untreated patients, 13 had severe complications (including 4 deaths and 1 need for liver transplantation); all 13 continued to be HBeAg-positive.

An analysis of the relationship between achieved LDL-C and hs-CRP targets and outcomes for simvastatin and ezetimibe/simvastatin was prespecified in Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial (IMPROVE-IT).
METHODS AND RESULTS: The IMPROVE-IT trial randomly assigned 18 144 patients stabilized after acute coronary syndrome to simvastatin or ezetimibe/simvastatin. LDL-C and hs-CRP were measured at baseline and 1 month after randomization. Outcomes were assessed in those achieving one or both of the prespecified targets of LDL-C<70 mg/dL and hs-CRP<2 mg/L versus achieving neither target, adjusting for differences in baseline characteristics. An exploratory analysis examined targets of LDL-C<50 mg/dL and hs-CRP<1 mg/L. Patients meeting both targets at baseline, with no 1-month values, or with end points before 1 month were excluded. Of 15 179 patients, 39% achieved the dual LDL-C (<70 mg/dL) and hs-CRP (<2 mg/L) targets at 1 month, 14% met neither target, 14% met only the hs-CRP target, and 33% met only the LDL-C target. Those achieving dual targets had lower primary end point rates than those meeting neither target (cardiovascular death, major coronary event, or stroke; 38.9% versus 28.0%; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.73; 0.66-0.81; P<0.001). More patients treated with ezetimibe/simvastatin met dual targets than those treated with simvastatin alone (50% versus 29%, P<0.001). The association of dual-target attainment with improved outcomes was similar irrespective of treatment assignment (P-interaction=0.65). Similar findings were observed using the exploratory targets.
CONCLUSIONS: Significantly more patients treated with ezetimibe/simvastatin met prespecified and exploratory dual LDL-C and hs-CRP targets than patients treated with simvastatin alone. Reaching both LDL-C and hs-CRP targets was associated with improved outcomes after multivariable adjustment.

The cognitive safety of evolocumab has been established in adults but has not yet been described in pediatric patients.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of evolocumab on cognitive function in pediatric heterozygous FH.
METHODS: Cognitive function was assessed during a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (HAUSER-RCT) evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 24 weeks of monthly subcutaneous injections of evolocumab in pediatric patients with FH. Cognitive safety endpoints included changes from baseline to week 24 in test scores in domains of psychomotor function, attention, visual learning, and executive function. Between-group differences in age-standardized mean test score changes were analyzed using analysis of covariance models and point estimates with 95% confidence interval (CI). Magnitudes of difference between treatment groups (Cohen's d) and reliable change indices were calculated for each cognitive function test.
RESULTS: At week 24, changes from baseline in age-standardized cognitive test scores were similar between the treatment groups. Differences (95% CI) between the evolocumab and placebo groups in mean test score changes for the Groton Maze Learning, One-Card Learning, Identification, and Detection tests were 0.1 (-0.2, 0.4), -0.1 (-0.5, 0.4), 0.3 (0.0, 0.7), 0.3 (-0.1, 0.8), respectively.

Measurement of this symptom in previous research has largely been based on subjective patient ratings. This study was designed to measure efficacy, onset, and duration of action of the corticosteroid mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS) on nasal congestion using an environmental exposure chamber (EEC) and the objective assessment acoustic rhinometry (AcR).
METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, ragweed-sensitive subjects were exposed to ragweed pollen (3500 ± 500 pollen grains/m(3)) in an EEC (day 1). Subjects rated instantaneous total nasal symptom score (TNSS), including NSS for congestion (NSS-C). Qualifying subjects received MFNS, 200 micrograms, or placebo and rated postdosing symptoms; a subset received MFNS, 200 micrograms, or placebo q.d. for 6 subsequent days, returning to EEC on day 8. Days 1 and 8 assessments included AcR, TNSS, and the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire developed for use in the EEC (RQOLQ-EEC).
RESULTS: At day 1, hour 6, patients receiving MFNS (n = 155) reported significantly reduced congestion versus placebo (n = 155) per AcR and NSS-C after one dose, showing numerically superior TNSS change from baseline (p = NS). Among the subset who received 6 additional days of treatment, MFNS (n = 78) yielded significantly lower TNSS versus placebo (n = 77) before day 8 EEC entry and throughout 4-hour exposure (p < 0.05), except at 3.5 hours. AcR showed lower congestion with MFNS versus placebo before day 8 EEC exposure and at 24 and 26 hours after final dose (p < 0.05 for all). AcR and NSS-C correlated at multiple time points. Day 8 RQOLQ-EEC between-group scores were significantly different (p = 0.02) for practical problems.

It is unknown how combining these treatments may impact their effectiveness, especially in the context of primary care and other nonspecialty settings.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of medication, behavioral therapies, and their combinations for treatment of alcohol dependence and to evaluate placebo effect on overall outcome.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized controlled trial conducted January 2001-January 2004 among 1383 recently alcohol-abstinent volunteers (median age, 44 years) from 11 US academic sites with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, diagnoses of primary alcohol dependence.
INTERVENTIONS: Eight groups of patients received medical management with 16 weeks of naltrexone (100 mg/d) or acamprosate (3 g/d), both, and/or both placebos, with or without a combined behavioral intervention (CBI). A ninth group received CBI only (no pills). Patients were also evaluated for up to 1 year after treatment.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Percent days abstinent from alcohol and time to first heavy drinking day.
RESULTS: All groups showed substantial reduction in drinking. During treatment, patients receiving naltrexone plus medical management (n = 302), CBI plus medical management and placebos (n = 305), or both naltrexone and CBI plus medical management (n = 309) had higher percent days abstinent (80.6, 79.2, and 77.1, respectively) than the 75.1 in those receiving placebos and medical management only (n = 305), a significant naltrexone x behavioral intervention interaction (P = .009). Naltrexone also reduced risk of a heavy drinking day (hazard ratio, 0.72; 97.5% CI, 0.53-0.98; P = .02) over time, most evident in those receiving medical management but not CBI. Acamprosate showed no significant effect on drinking vs placebo, either by itself or with any combination of naltrexone, CBI, or both. During treatment, those receiving CBI without pills or medical management (n = 157) had lower percent days abstinent (66.6) than those receiving placebo plus medical management alone (n = 153) or placebo plus medical management and CBI (n = 156) (73.8 and 79.8, respectively; P<.001). One year after treatment, these between-group effects were similar but no longer significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients receiving medical management with naltrexone, CBI, or both fared better on drinking outcomes, whereas acamprosate showed no evidence of efficacy, with or without CBI. No combination produced better efficacy than naltrexone or CBI alone in the presence of medical management. Placebo pills and meeting with a health care professional had a positive effect above that of CBI during treatment. Naltrexone with medical management could be delivered in health care settings, thus serving alcohol-dependent patients who might otherwise not receive treatment.

Time points of measurement: 48 hours after ROSC.,26525271,Predictive value of interleukin-6 in post-cardiac arrest patients treated with targeted temperature management at 33 °C or 36 °C.,"AIM: Post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS) is characterized by systemic inflammation, however data on the prognostic value of inflammatory markers is sparse. We sought to investigate the importance of systemic inflammation, assessed by interleukin-6 (IL-6) in comatose survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
METHODS: A total of 682 patients enrolled in the Target Temperature Management (TTM) trial, surviving >24h with available IL-6 data were included. IL-6 was measured on days 1, 2 and 3 after return of spontaneous circulation. Severity of PCAS was assessed daily by the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score. Survival status was recorded at 30 days.
RESULTS: High levels of IL-6 at day 1-3 (all p<0.0001) were independently associated with severity of PCAS with no interaction of target temperature (all p=NS). IL-6 levels did not differ between temperature groups (p(interaction)=0.99). IL-6 levels at day 2 (p<0.0001) and day 3 (p<0.0001) were associated with crude mortality. Adjusted Cox proportional-hazards analysis showed that a two-fold increase of IL-6 levels at day 2 (HR=1.15 (95% CI: 1.07-1.23), p=0.0002) and day 3 (HR=1.18 (95% CI: 1.09-1.27), p<0.0001) were associated with mortality. IL-6 levels at day 3 had the highest discriminative value in predicting mortality (AUC=0.66). IL-6 did not significantly improve 30-day mortality prediction compared to traditional prognostic factors (p=0.08).

METHODS: In this multicenter trial, 52 patients with primary SS were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive subcutaneous injections of 100 mg of baminercept every week for 24 weeks or matching placebo. The primary end point was the change between screening and week 24 in the stimulated whole salivary flow (SWSF) rate. Secondary end points included the European League Against Rheumatism Sjögren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI), as well as measurements of select chemokines and cytokines and enumeration of peripheral blood B and T cell subsets.
RESULTS: The change from baseline to week 24 in the SWSF rate was not significantly different between the baminercept and placebo treatment groups (baseline-adjusted mean change -0.01 versus 0.07 ml/minute; P = 0.332). The change in the ESSDAI during treatment was also not significantly different between the treatment groups (baseline-adjusted mean change -1.23 versus -0.15; P = 0.104). Although the incidence of adverse events was similar between the treatment groups, baminercept therapy was associated with a higher incidence of liver toxicity, including 2 serious adverse events. Baminercept also produced a significant decrease in plasma levels of CXCL13 and significant changes in the number of circulating B and T cells, consistent with its known inhibitory effects on LTβR signaling.
CONCLUSION: In this trial, treatment with baminercept failed to significantly improve glandular and extraglandular disease in patients with primary SS, despite evidence from mechanistic studies showing that it blocks LTβR signaling.",0,PRIMARY,Change From Screening in Stimulated Whole Salivary Flow at Week 24,After an unstimulated salivary flow assessment the participant was administered a single 5-mg dose of pilocarpine to stimulate saliva production.

We tested the hypothesis that TC improves physical function in older adults living in low-income housing facilities.
DESIGN: Cluster randomized controlled trial.
SETTING: Subsidized housing facilities in Boston, Massachusetts, and neighboring communities.
PARTICIPANTS: Volunteers were recruited from 15 facilities. The 180 randomized participants were 60 years of age or older, able to understand English and participate in TC, expected to remain in the facility for 1 year, and able to walk independently.
INTERVENTION: TC classes were conducted in the housing facilities twice/week for 1 year and compared with monthly health promotion educational classes and social calls.
MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was physical function measured by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Secondary outcomes included other aspects of physical and cognitive function, and falls.
RESULTS: An interim analysis revealed less improvement over 12 months in SPPB scores among TC participants (+.20 units; 95% confidence interval [CI] = -.20 to +.60; P = .69) vs control participants (+.51 units; 95% CI = +.15 to +.87; P = .007), a difference of -.31 units (95% CI = -.66 to .04; P = .082). This met the criterion for futility, and the Data Safety Monitoring Board recommended trial termination. No differences were found in 6- or 12-month changes favoring TC in any secondary outcomes or adverse events.

METHODS: We conducted a multicenter trial to evaluate the use of dronedarone in 4628 patients with atrial fibrillation who had additional risk factors for death. Patients were randomly assigned to receive dronedarone, 400 mg twice a day, or placebo. The primary outcome was the first hospitalization due to cardiovascular events or death. Secondary outcomes were death from any cause, death from cardiovascular causes, and hospitalization due to cardiovascular events.
RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 21+/-5 months, with the study drug discontinued prematurely in 696 of the 2301 patients (30.2%) receiving dronedarone and in 716 of the 2327 patients (30.8%) receiving placebo, mostly because of adverse events.

What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is commonly used as a primary treatment for patients with prostate cancer (PCa) who are not eligible for radical treatment options. ADT is also used in patients with PCa as neo-adjuvant hormone therapy to reduce prostate volume and down-stage the disease before radiotherapy with curative intent. The present study showed that ADT with the gonadotropin hormone-releasing hormone (GhRH) antagonist degarelix is non-inferior to combined treatment with the LHRH agonist goserelin and bicalutamide in terms of reducing prostate volume during the treatment period of 3 months. Degarelix treatment evokes, however, significantly better relief of lower urinary tract symptoms in patients having moderate and severe voiding problems.
OBJECTIVE: • To assess the efficacy of monthly degarelix treatment for reduction of total prostate volume (TPV), relief of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and improvement of quality of life (QoL) in patients with prostate cancer (PCa) using monthly goserelin as active control.
METHODS: • This was a randomized, parallel-arm, active-controlled, open-label, multicentre trial on 182 patients treated with either monthly degarelix (240/80 mg) or goserelin (3.6 mg) for 12 weeks. • For flare protection, goserelin-treated patients also received daily bicalutamide (50 mg) during the initial 28 days. • Key trial variables monitored monthly were TPV (primary endpoint), serum testosterone, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and the Benign Prostate Hyperplasia Impact Index.
RESULTS: • In all, 175 patients completed the trial (96.1%). • At week 12, changes in TPV for degarelix and goserelin were similar (-37.2% vs -39.0%) and met the predefined non-inferiority criterion. • Decreases in IPSS were greater in degarelix than in goserelin-treated patients, differences being statistically significant in patients with baseline IPSS > 13 (-6.7 ± 1.8 vs -4.0 ± 1.0; P = 0.02). • The number of patients with an IPSS change of ≥ 3 over baseline was also significantly higher in patients treated with degarelix (61.0 vs 44.3%, P = 0.02). • Both treatments were safe and well tolerated.
CONCLUSIONS: • Medical castration reduces TPV and could also improve LUTS in patients with PCa. • While the short-term efficacy of degarelix and goserelin + bicalutamide was the same in terms of TPV reduction, degarelix showed superiority in LUTS relief in symptomatic patients, which could highlight the different actions of these drugs on extrapituitary gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptors in the bladder and/or the prostate.",0,PRIMARY,Change From Baseline in Prostate Size Based on Trans Rectal Ultra Sound (TRUS) at Week 12 (Per Protocol Analysis Set),TRUS is a method of measuring the size of the prostate.,Degarelix 240 mg/80 mg,Goserelin (3.6 mg) + Bicalutamide (50 mg),"The degarelix doses were administered into the abdominal wall every 28 days.

Yet, clinicians are poor judges of adherence, and uncertainty about adherence may promote inertia with respect to medication modification.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the effect of sharing electronically-measured adherence data with clinicians on the management of uncontrolled hypertension.
DESIGN: This was a cluster randomized trial.
PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-four primary care providers (12 intervention, 12 usual care; cluster units) and 100 patients with uncontrolled hypertension (65 intervention, 35 usual care) were included in the study.
INTERVENTIONS: At one visit per patient, clinicians in the intervention group received a report summarizing electronically measured adherence to the BP regimen and recommended clinical actions. Clinicians in the control group did not receive a report.
MAIN MEASURES: The primary outcome was the proportion of visits with appropriate clinical management (i.e., treatment intensification among adherent patients and adherence counseling among nonadherent patients). Secondary outcomes included patient-rated quality of care and communication during the visit.
KEY RESULTS: The proportion of visits with appropriate clinical management was higher in the intervention group than the control group (45 out of 65; 69 %) versus (12 out of 35; 34 %; p = 0.001). A higher proportion of adherent patients in the intervention group had their regimen intensified (p = 0.01), and a higher proportion of nonadherent patients in the intervention group received adherence counseling (p = 0.005). Patients in the intervention group were more likely to give their clinician high ratings on quality of care (p = 0.05), and on measures of patient-centered (p = 0.001) and collaborative communication (p = 0.02).

We evaluated the efficacy of the individualized texting for adherence building (iTAB) intervention among persons living with HIV (PLWH) who meet criteria for METH use disorder. We examined daily associations between ART adherence and text-reported METH use and depressed mood.
METHODS: We conducted a single site, 2-arm, 6-week, pilot randomized clinical trial comparing a personalized, bidirectional, text messaging system (iTAB; n = 50) to an active control condition (n = 25). All participants received adherence psychoeducation and daily texts assessing METH use and depressed mood. The iTAB group received personalized daily ART reminder texts. ART adherence was monitored using Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) caps.
RESULTS: Response rates to daily ART reminder texts were high (79%), with good concordance between MEMS-derived and text-reported ART adherence (p < .001). Intervention groups did not differ in MEMS-derived ART adherence (68% iTAB, 70% active control; p = .68); however, participants in the iTAB group had fewer METH use days (median 14.4 iTAB, 22.0 active control; p = .05). Text-reported METH use, but not depressed mood, was associated with poorer MEMS-derived ART adherence.
CONCLUSIONS: High text response rates and good concordance between MEMS-derived and text-reported adherence suggests text messaging is a feasible intervention delivery approach that provides a valid indication of ART adherence.

Using a consensus process, a panel of experts convened in 2011 (an initiative of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine endorsed by the American Thoracic Society and the Society of Critical Care Medicine) developed the Berlin Definition, focusing on feasibility, reliability, validity, and objective evaluation of its performance. A draft definition proposed 3 mutually exclusive categories of ARDS based on degree of hypoxemia: mild (200 mm Hg &lt; PaO2/FIO2 ≤ 300 mm Hg), moderate (100 mm Hg &lt; PaO2/FIO2 ≤ 200 mm Hg), and severe (PaO2/FIO2 ≤ 100 mm Hg) and 4 ancillary variables for severe ARDS: radiographic severity, respiratory system compliance (≤40 mL/cm H2O), positive end-expiratory pressure (≥10 cm H2O), and corrected expired volume per minute (≥10 L/min). The draft Berlin Definition was empirically evaluated using patient-level meta-analysis of 4188 patients with ARDS from 4 multicenter clinical data sets and 269 patients with ARDS from 3 single-center data sets containing physiologic information. The 4 ancillary variables did not contribute to the predictive validity of severe ARDS for mortality and were removed from the definition. Using the Berlin Definition, stages of mild, moderate, and severe ARDS were associated with increased mortality (27%; 95% CI, 24%-30%; 32%; 95% CI, 29%-34%; and 45%; 95% CI, 42%-48%, respectively; P &lt; .001) and increased median duration of mechanical ventilation in survivors (5 days; interquartile [IQR], 2-11; 7 days; IQR, 4-14; and 9 days; IQR, 5-17, respectively; P &lt; .001).

DESIGN: A consensus committee of 68 international experts representing 30 international organizations was convened. Nominal groups were assembled at key international meetings (for those committee members attending the conference). A formal conflict of interest policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. The entire guidelines process was conducted independent of any industry funding. A stand-alone meeting was held for all subgroup heads, co- and vice-chairs, and selected individuals. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee served as an integral part of the development.
METHODS: The authors were advised to follow the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations as strong (1) or weak (2). The potential drawbacks of making strong recommendations in the presence of low-quality evidence were emphasized. Recommendations were classified into three groups: (1) those directly targeting severe sepsis; (2) those targeting general care of the critically ill patient and considered high priority in severe sepsis; and (3) pediatric considerations.
RESULTS: Key recommendations and suggestions, listed by category, include: early quantitative resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 h after recognition (1C); blood cultures before antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm a potential source of infection (UG); administration of broad-spectrum antimicrobials therapy within 1 h of the recognition of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1C) as the goal of therapy; reassessment of antimicrobial therapy daily for de-escalation, when appropriate (1B); infection source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method within 12 h of diagnosis (1C); initial fluid resuscitation with crystalloid (1B) and consideration of the addition of albumin in patients who continue to require substantial amounts of crystalloid to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (2C) and the avoidance of hetastarch formulations (1B); initial fluid challenge in patients with sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion and suspicion of hypovolemia to achieve a minimum of 30 mL/kg of crystalloids (more rapid administration and greater amounts of fluid may be needed in some patients (1C); fluid challenge technique continued as long as hemodynamic improvement is based on either dynamic or static variables (UG); norepinephrine as the first-choice vasopressor to maintain mean arterial pressure ≥65 mmHg (1B); epinephrine when an additional agent is needed to maintain adequate blood pressure (2B); vasopressin (0.03 U/min) can be added to norepinephrine to either raise mean arterial pressure to target or to decrease norepinephrine dose but should not be used as the initial vasopressor (UG); dopamine is not recommended except in highly selected circumstances (2C); dobutamine infusion administered or added to vasopressor in the presence of (a) myocardial dysfunction as suggested by elevated cardiac filling pressures and low cardiac output, or (b) ongoing signs of hypoperfusion despite achieving adequate intravascular volume and adequate mean arterial pressure (1C); avoiding use of intravenous hydrocortisone in adult septic shock patients if adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are able to restore hemodynamic stability (2C); hemoglobin target of 7-9 g/dL in the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, ischemic coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage (1B); low tidal volume (1A) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure (1B) for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in ARDS (1B); higher rather than lower level of PEEP for patients with sepsis-induced moderate or severe ARDS (2C); recruitment maneuvers in sepsis patients with severe refractory hypoxemia due to ARDS (2C); prone positioning in sepsis-induced ARDS patients with a PaO (2)/FiO (2) ratio of ≤100 mm Hg in facilities that have experience with such practices (2C); head-of-bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ARDS who do not have evidence of tissue hypoperfusion (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation (1A); minimizing use of either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation targeting specific titration endpoints (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers if possible in the septic patient without ARDS (1C); a short course of neuromuscular blocker (no longer than 48 h) for patients with early ARDS and a PaO (2)/FI O (2) <150 mm Hg (2C); a protocolized approach to blood glucose management commencing insulin dosing when two consecutive blood glucose levels are >180 mg/dL, targeting an upper blood glucose ≤180 mg/dL (1A); equivalency of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1B); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with bleeding risk factors (1B); oral or enteral (if necessary) feedings, as tolerated, rather than either complete fasting or provision of only intravenous glucose within the first 48 h after a diagnosis of severe sepsis/septic shock (2C); and addressing goals of care, including treatment plans and end-of-life planning (as appropriate) (1B), as early as feasible, but within 72 h of intensive care unit admission (2C). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include: therapy with face mask oxygen, high flow nasal cannula oxygen, or nasopharyngeal continuous PEEP in the presence of respiratory distress and hypoxemia (2C), use of physical examination therapeutic endpoints such as capillary refill (2C); for septic shock associated with hypovolemia, the use of crystalloids or albumin to deliver a bolus of 20 mL/kg of crystalloids (or albumin equivalent) over 5-10 min (2C); more common use of inotropes and vasodilators for low cardiac output septic shock associated with elevated systemic vascular resistance (2C); and use of hydrocortisone only in children with suspected or proven ""absolute""' adrenal insufficiency (2C).
CONCLUSIONS: Strong agreement existed among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best care of patients with severe sepsis.

This prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study was designed to test the hypothesis that oral olanzapine is superior to placebo at preventing postdischarge nausea and vomiting.
METHODS: In a single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, the authors compared a single preoperative dose of olanzapine 10 mg to placebo, in adult female patients 50 years old or less, undergoing ambulatory gynecologic or plastic surgery with general anesthesia. All patients received standard antiemetic prophylaxis with dexamethasone and ondansetron. The primary composite outcome was nausea and/or vomiting in the 24 h after discharge. Secondary outcomes included severe nausea, vomiting, and side effects.
RESULTS: A total of 140 patients were randomized and evaluable. The primary outcome occurred in 26 of 69 patients (38%) in the placebo group and in 10 of 71 patients (14%) in the olanzapine group (relative risk, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.72; P = 0.003). Severe nausea occurred in 14 patients (20%) in the placebo group and 4 patients (6%) in the olanzapine group (relative risk, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.80).

We evaluated rifaximin, a minimally absorbed antibiotic, as treatment for IBS.
METHODS: In two identically designed, phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (TARGET 1 and TARGET 2), patients who had IBS without constipation were randomly assigned to either rifaximin at a dose of 550 mg or placebo, three times daily for 2 weeks, and were followed for an additional 10 weeks. The primary end point, the proportion of patients who had adequate relief of global IBS symptoms, and the key secondary end point, the proportion of patients who had adequate relief of IBS-related bloating, were assessed weekly. Adequate relief was defined as self-reported relief of symptoms for at least 2 of the first 4 weeks after treatment. Other secondary end points included the percentage of patients who had a response to treatment as assessed by daily self-ratings of global IBS symptoms and individual symptoms of bloating, abdominal pain, and stool consistency during the 4 weeks after treatment and during the entire 3 months of the study.
RESULTS: Significantly more patients in the rifaximin group than in the placebo group had adequate relief of global IBS symptoms during the first 4 weeks after treatment (40.8% vs. 31.2%, P=0.01, in TARGET 1; 40.6% vs. 32.2%, P=0.03, in TARGET 2; 40.7% vs. 31.7%, P<0.001, in the two studies combined). Similarly, more patients in the rifaximin group than in the placebo group had adequate relief of bloating (39.5% vs. 28.7%, P=0.005, in TARGET 1; 41.0% vs. 31.9%, P=0.02, in TARGET 2; 40.2% vs. 30.3%, P<0.001, in the two studies combined). In addition, significantly more patients in the rifaximin group had a response to treatment as assessed by daily ratings of IBS symptoms, bloating, abdominal pain, and stool consistency.

Despite this fact, well-designed investigations on specific management strategies for TRALI are lacking. Indeed, current recommendations are primarily based on data extrapolated from trials of the histo-pathologically similar Acute Lung Injury and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndromes. The cornerstone of TRALI management is supportive care with oxygen supplementation and ventilatory assistance when needed. When mechanical ventilation is required, attenuating additional ventilator-induced lung injury through the avoidance of high tidal volumes and elevated airway pressures, with additional measures such as positive end-expiratory pressure to prevent low-volume shear stress injury, are recommended. The literature is not currently sufficient to support either corticosteroids or statins as effective therapies in TRALI. Conservative fluid practices are desirable, provided care is taken to avoid hypotension. Preventative strategies have shown the most promise in mitigating this transfusion-related pulmonary complication. Specifically, conservative transfusion practices and deferral of high-plasma component donors who have, or at high risk of having, anti-human leukocyte antigen and/or anti-human neutrophil antigen antibodies have meaningfully impacted the incidence of TRALI. Future considerations for patients who are at increased risk for developing TRALI may include therapies such as anti-platelet agents and alternatives to traditional blood components such as prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC).

Since increasing disease severity often requires more fluid for resuscitation, it is unclear whether fluid overload is a causative factor in morbidity or is simply an indicator of disease severity.
OBJECTIVE: Investigate the association between fluid overload and oxygenation while controlling for severity of illness by daily Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction scores.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The oxygenation index, fluid overload percent, and daily Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction scores were obtained in a retrospective chart review of 80 patients (mean age 58.7 ± 73.0 months) with respiratory failure. Univariate and multivariate approaches were used to assess the independent relation between fluid overload percent and duration of stay and ventilation.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MAIN RESULTS: Higher peak fluid overload percent predicted higher peak oxygenation index, independent of age, gender, and Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction (p = .009). Fluid overload percent ≥15% on any given day was also independently associated with that day's oxygenation index, controlled for age, gender, and Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction (p < .05). Peak fluid overload percent and severe fluid overload percent (≥15%) were both independently associated with longer duration of ventilation (p = .004, p = .01), and pediatric intensive care unit (p = .008, p = .01) and hospital length of stay (p = .02, p = .04), controlled for age, gender, Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction, and in the case of ventilation, respiratory admission.

Results from a randomized, phase 3, open-label, active-controlled trial- STRUCTURE-showed that in patients previously treated with bisphosphonates, romosozumab led to gains in hip BMD, which were not observed with teriparatide. This post hoc analysis investigated the comparative utility of early changes in P1NP in predicting BMD response in patients who participated in the STRUCTURE trial, which enrolled patients who switched treatment from bisphosphonates to romosozumab/teriparatide.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Postmenopausal women (aged 55-90 years) with osteoporosis who had previously taken bisphosphonates were randomized to receive open-label subcutaneous romosozumab (210 mg once monthly; n = 218) or teriparatide (20 µg once daily; n = 218) for 12 months. BMD was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at the proximal femur and lumbar spine (LS) at baseline and months 6 and 12. To assess the utility of P1NP, the positive predictive value of increase from baseline in P1NP of > 10 µg/L at month 1 and achievement of various thresholds of percent change from baseline in BMD at month 12 were evaluated.
RESULTS: Overall, 95% (191/202) of patients in the romosozumab group and 91% (183/201) in the teriparatide group demonstrated an increase in P1NP of > 10 µg/L from baseline at month 1. Among these patients, 18% and 3% of romosozumab-treated patients versus 60% and 12% of teriparatide-treated patients showed no increase from baseline (i.e., ≤ 0%) in total hip and LS BMD, respectively, at month 12. These data indicate that in patients switching from bisphosphonates to a bone-forming therapy, increases in P1NP do not help predict the hip BMD response. Although most patients treated with either teriparatide or romosozumab showed an increase in P1NP, the majority of patients on romosozumab showed an increase in hip BMD, while more than half of the patients on teriparatide did not. Teriparatide therapy did not increase total hip BMD in the majority of patients who transitioned from bisphosphonates to teriparatide.
CONCLUSIONS: Thus, increases in P1NP were not predictive of BMD response in the teriparatide group because in approximately 60% of the patients who were administered teriparatide, the hip BMD decreased independent of the change in P1NP levels.",2,PRIMARY,Percent Change From Baseline Through Month 12 in Total Hip Bone Mineral Density (BMD),Bone mineral density was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and patient experience when converting from GA20 to GA40.
METHODS/TRIAL DESIGN: GLACIER was an open-label, randomized, parallel-group trial conducted at 31 sites in the US between June 2013 and December 2013. Stable RRMS patients on GA20 were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to continue with GA20 or convert to GA40. The adjusted mean annualized rate of IRAEs was the primary endpoint for this study. Additionally, the severity of IRAEs, rate of injection-site reactions (ISRs), and patient-reported MS impact and treatment satisfaction were compared for the two treatment groups over the 4-month core study.
RESULTS: A total of 209 patients were randomized to convert to GA40 (n=108) or continue with GA20 (n=101). The adjusted mean annualized rate of IRAEs was reduced by 50% with GA40 (35.3 events per year; n=108) versus GA20 (70.4 events per year; n=101) (risk ratio (RR)=0.50; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.34-0.74; p=0.0006). There was a 60% reduction in the rate of moderate/severe events (GA40 (n=108): 0.9 events per year versus GA20 (n=101): 2.2 events per year; RR=0.40; p=0.0021). Perception of treatment convenience improved for GA40-treated patients soon after converting and was sustained.
CONCLUSIONS: The GLACIER study demonstrates a favorable IRAE and convenience profile of GA40 for RRMS patients.

The adverse events are preceded by acute worsening of oral glucose tolerance (oGTT) along with reduced plasma free fatty acids (FFA) and leptin in animal models. It is unclear whether the same acute effects occur in humans.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial was conducted to examine the potential metabolic effects of olanzapine in healthy volunteers. Participants included male (8) and female (7) subjects [18-30 years old, BMI 18.5-25]. Subjects received placebo or olanzapine (10 mg/day) for three days prior to oGTT testing. Primary endpoints included measurement of plasma leptin, oral glucose tolerance, and plasma free fatty acids (FFA). Secondary metabolic endpoints included: triglycerides, total cholesterol, high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, heart rate, blood pressure, body weight and BMI. Olanzapine increased glucose Area Under the Curve (AUC) by 42% (2808±474 vs. 3984±444 mg/dl·min; P = 0.0105) during an oGTT. Fasting plasma leptin and triglycerides were elevated 24% (Leptin: 6.8±1.3 vs. 8.4±1.7 ng/ml; P = 0.0203) and 22% (Triglycerides: 88.9±10.1 vs. 108.2±11.6 mg/dl; P = 0.0170), whereas FFA and HDL declined by 32% (FFA: 0.38±0.06 vs. 0.26±0.04 mM; P = 0.0166) and 11% (54.2±4.7 vs. 48.9±4.3 mg/dl; P = 0.0184), respectively after olanzapine. Other measures were unchanged.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Olanzapine exerts some but not all of the early endocrine/metabolic changes observed in rodent models of the metabolic side effects, and this suggest that antipsychotic effects are not limited to perturbations in glucose metabolism alone. Future prospective clinical studies should focus on identifying which reliable metabolic alterations might be useful as potential screening tools in assessing patient susceptibility to weight gain and diabetes caused by atypical antipsychotics.

Diabetic foot infections (DFIs) typically begin in a wound, most often a neuropathic ulceration. While all wounds are colonized with microorganisms, the presence of infection is defined by ≥2 classic findings of inflammation or purulence. Infections are then classified into mild (superficial and limited in size and depth), moderate (deeper or more extensive), or severe (accompanied by systemic signs or metabolic perturbations). This classification system, along with a vascular assessment, helps determine which patients should be hospitalized, which may require special imaging procedures or surgical interventions, and which will require amputation. Most DFIs are polymicrobial, with aerobic gram-positive cocci (GPC), and especially staphylococci, the most common causative organisms. Aerobic gram-negative bacilli are frequently copathogens in infections that are chronic or follow antibiotic treatment, and obligate anaerobes may be copathogens in ischemic or necrotic wounds. Wounds without evidence of soft tissue or bone infection do not require antibiotic therapy. For infected wounds, obtain a post-debridement specimen (preferably of tissue) for aerobic and anaerobic culture. Empiric antibiotic therapy can be narrowly targeted at GPC in many acutely infected patients, but those at risk for infection with antibiotic-resistant organisms or with chronic, previously treated, or severe infections usually require broader spectrum regimens. Imaging is helpful in most DFIs; plain radiographs may be sufficient, but magnetic resonance imaging is far more sensitive and specific. Osteomyelitis occurs in many diabetic patients with a foot wound and can be difficult to diagnose (optimally defined by bone culture and histology) and treat (often requiring surgical debridement or resection, and/or prolonged antibiotic therapy). Most DFIs require some surgical intervention, ranging from minor (debridement) to major (resection, amputation). Wounds must also be properly dressed and off-loaded of pressure, and patients need regular follow-up. An ischemic foot may require revascularization, and some nonresponding patients may benefit from selected adjunctive measures. Employing multidisciplinary foot teams improves outcomes. Clinicians and healthcare organizations should attempt to monitor, and thereby improve, their outcomes and processes in caring for DFIs.",2,PRIMARY,Change From Baseline Myofibroblasts Formation (Myofibroblasts Content) at 6 Weeks,"Actin staining was used to evaluate the presence of myofibroblasts involved in wound healing.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of brief, primary care interventions for pediatric weight management on BMI.
DATA SOURCES: Medline, CENTRAL, Embase, PsycInfo, and CINAHL were searched for relevant publications from January 1976 to March 2016 and cross-referenced with published studies.
STUDY SELECTION: Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies that compared the effect of office-based primary care weight management interventions to any control intervention on percent BMI or BMI z scores in children aged 2 to 18 years.
DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently screened sources, extracted data on participant, intervention, and study characteristics, z-BMI/percent BMI, harms, and study quality using the Cochrane and Newcastle-Ottawa risk of bias tools.
RESULTS: A random effects model was used to pool the effect size across eligible 10 randomized controlled trials and 2 quasi-experimental studies. Compared with usual care or control treatment, brief interventions feasible for primary care were associated with a significant but small reduction in BMI z score (-0.04, [95% confidence interval, -0.08 to -0.01]; P = .02) and a nonsignificant effect on body satisfaction (standardized mean difference 0.00, [95% confidence interval, -0.21 to 0.22]; P = .98).
LIMITATIONS: Studies had methodological limitations, follow-up was brief, and adverse effects were not commonly measured.

DESIGN: Prospective, single-center study.
SETTING: University hospital and research laboratory.
PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen adults with stable CHF receiving optimal treatment and 16 healthy control subjects.
INTERVENTION: Participants were immunized with the 2006-2007 trivalent inactivated (killed) influenza vaccine during October-December of 2006.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Blood samples were taken from the participants before and 2-4 weeks after vaccination to measure antibody titers, which were measured with a hemagglutination inhibition assay, then 3-4 months after vaccination to assess T-cell responses, measured by using the trans vivo delayed-type hypersensitivity method. As part of this method, which mimics physiologic conditions, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from the blood samples. The cells were mixed with influenza vaccine antigens A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B type and injected into the footpads of SCID mice (mice with severe combined immunodeficiency), as their resulting swelling is an index of human T-cell sensitization. Median T-cell-mediated immune responses to A/H3N2 were less vigorous in patients with CHF than in control subjects (62.5 vs 87.5 microm, unadjusted p=0.031, age-adjusted p=0.006). Median responses to A/H1N1 were not significantly different between the groups (56.3 vs 75 microm, p=0.11). Median responses to B type were also similar between the groups (62.5 vs 75 microm, p=0.47). All participants mounted an antibody response to the influenza vaccine.
CONCLUSION: Patients with CHF had reduced T-cell responses to the influenza vaccine compared with healthy control subjects, as demonstrated by a lower response to A/H3N2, the newest antigen in the 2006-2007 vaccine. However, differences in T-cell immune responses to the A/H1N1 and B type strains were not found to be significant between the two groups, which suggests that patients with CHF can mount an appropriate response to vaccine antigens to which they have been previously exposed, but less so to new antigens. These findings suggest that patients with CHF may be at increased risk for influenza infection, and clinicians may want to investigate other or additional strategies for influenza vaccination.",2,PRIMARY,All-Cause Death or Cardiopulmonary Hospitalization Within Each Vaccination Season,Number of patients with first occurrence of death or cardiopulmonary hospitalization within each vaccination season,High Dose Influenza Vaccine,Standard Dose Influenza Vaccine,"High Dose Influenza Vaccine

Gaseous nitric oxide has been demonstrated to have a myocardial protective effect following ischemia-reperfusion. We hypothesized that gaseous nitric oxide administered during cardiopulmonary bypass would have similar beneficial effects.
METHODS: In a prospective, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study, children undergoing repair of tetralogy of Fallot received either 20 ppm of gaseous nitric oxide or placebo delivered to the membrane oxygenator during cardiopulmonary bypass.
RESULTS: A total of 16 children were randomized into 2 equal groups once their parents or guardians had given written informed consent. No differences were found in age, crossclamp time, cardiopulmonary bypass time, or methemoglobin between the 2 groups. The group receiving gaseous nitric oxide had a significantly shortened duration of mechanical ventilation (8.4 ± 7.6 vs 16.3 ± 6.5 hours; P < .05) and intensive care unit length of stay (53.8 ± 19.7 vs 79.4 ± 37.7 hours; P < .05) compared with the placebo group. The patients had significantly lower troponin levels at 12, 24, and 48 hours (P < .05) and lower B-type natriuretic peptide levels at 12 and 24 hours (P < .05). A trend was found toward a less positive fluid balance, with significantly less diuretic usage. The study patients had a greater mean hemoglobin at 48 hours, despite the absence of differences in chest tube output, packed red blood cell transfusion, platelet counts or transfusion requirements, fresh frozen plasma transfusion, or prothrombin time/partial thromboplastin time in the first 48 hours.

METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed (January 2001 to May 2012) in EMBASE, including MEDLINE records, CENTRAL and PsycInfo. Trials meeting the following predefined inclusion criteria were included: adult patients with an HIV infection treated with HAART, an intervention to enhance patient adherence, adherence as the outcome, clinical outcomes, randomized controlled trial (RCT), article written in English or German, patient enrolment after 2001, and trial conducted in World Health Organization (WHO) stratum A. Selection was performed by two reviewers independently. All relevant data on patient characteristics, interventions, adherence measures and results were extracted in standardized tables. The methodological trial quality was evaluated by two reviewers independently. All discrepancies were discussed until a consensus was reached. A meta-analysis could not be performed because of the heterogeneity of trials.
RESULTS: In total, 21 trials fulfilled all inclusion criteria. Of 21 trials, only one that examined motivational interviewing for alcohol-dependent patients showed statistically significant results for adherence rates and viral load in favour of the intervention. One trial showed a statistically significant clinical effect of the intervention; however, inconsistent results were presented for adherence depending on the underlying adherence definition. The results of the remaining 19 trials were not statistically significant or were conflicting for adherence and/or clinical outcomes. However, the methodological trial quality was low.

However, few studies had been dedicated to the neurobiology underlying SAD until the last decade. Rates of non-responders to standard methods of treatment remain unsatisfactorily high of approximately 25%, including SAD. Advances in our understanding of SAD could lead to new treatment strategies. A potential non invasive therapeutic option is repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Thus, we reported two cases of SAD treated with rTMS Methods: The bibliographical search used Pubmed/Medline, ISI Web of Knowledge and Scielo databases. The terms chosen for the search were: anxiety disorders, neuroimaging, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.
RESULTS: In most of the studies conducted on anxiety disorders, except SAD, the right prefrontal cortex (PFC), more specifically dorsolateral PFC was stimulated, with marked results when applying high-rTMS compared with studies stimulating the opposite side. However, according to the ""valence hypothesis"", anxiety disorders might be characterized by an interhemispheric imbalance associated with increased right-hemispheric activity. With regard to the two cases treated with rTMS, we found a decrease in BDI, BAI and LSAS scores from baseline to follow-up.
CONCLUSION: We hypothesize that the application of low-rTMS over the right medial PFC (mPFC; the main structure involved in SAD circuitry) combined with high-rTMS over the left mPFC, for at least 4 weeks on consecutive weekdays, may induce a balance in brain activity, opening an attractive therapeutic option for the treatment of SAD.",2,PRIMARY,"Behavioral Approach Test, Change in Steps Completed",The difference between the number of steps completed during the pre- and post-treatment behavioral approach tests.,"Active iTBS, Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex (vmPFC)","Control iTBS, Vertex","Stimulation intensity of 100% of the individual resting motor threshold in bursts of three pulses at a frequency of 50 Hz every 200 ms on top of a 5Hz carrier wave.

The majority of these studies, however, are retrospective in nature and lack a control group.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We therefore (1) prospectively determined the incidence and severity of dysphagia after ACDF using lumbar decompression patients as a control group; and (2) determined which factors, if any, are associated with increased postoperative dysphagia.
METHODS: Patients undergoing either one- or two-level ACDF (n=38) or posterior lumbar decompression (n=56) were prospectively followed. Baseline patient characteristics were recorded. A dysphagia questionnaire was administered preoperatively and during the 2-week, 6-week, and 12-week postoperative visits. We found no differences in patient age, body mass index, or the preoperative incidence and severity of dysphagia between the cervical and lumbar groups. We compared the incidence and severity of dysphagia between the patients who had cervical and lumbar surgery.
RESULTS: Postoperatively, 71% of patients having cervical spine surgery reported dysphagia at 2 weeks followup. This incidence decreased to 8% at 12 weeks followup. The incidence and severity of dysphagia were greater in the cervical group at 2 and 6 weeks followup with a trend toward greater dysphagia at 12 weeks followup. Body mass index, gender, location of surgery, and the number of surgical levels were not related to the risk of developing dysphagia. We observed a correlation between operative time and the severity of postoperative dysphagia.
CONCLUSIONS: Dysphagia is common after ACDF. The incidence and severity of postoperative dysphagia decreases over time, although symptoms may persist at least 12 weeks after surgery.

DESIGN: A crossover design was used, in which the neonates served as their own controls. Subjects Preterm neonates (n = 74), between 32 and 36 weeks' postmenstrual age and within 10 days of birth, who were breathing without assistance and who were not receiving sedatives or analgesics in 3 level II to III neonatal intensive care units in Canada.
INTERVENTIONS: In the experimental condition, the neonate was held in KC for 30 minutes before the heel-lancing procedure and remained in KC for the duration of the procedure. In the control condition, the neonate was in the prone position in the isolette. The ordering of conditions was random.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the Premature Infant Pain Profile, which is composed of 3 facial actions, maximum heart rate, and minimum oxygen saturation changes from baseline in 30-second blocks. Videotapes, taken with the camera positioned on the neonate's face so that an observer could not tell whether the neonate was being held or was in the isolette, were coded by research assistants who were naïve to the purpose of the study. Heart rate and oxygen levels were continuously monitored into a computer for later analysis. A repeated-measures analysis of covariance was used, with order of condition and site as factors and severity of illness as a covariate.
RESULTS: Premature Infant Pain Profile scores across the first 90 seconds from the heel-lancing procedure were significantly (.002<P<.04) lower by 2 points in the KC condition.
CONCLUSIONS: For preterm neonates who are 32 weeks' postmenstrual age or older, KC seems to effectively decrease pain from heel lancing. Further study is needed to determine if younger neonates or those requiring assistance in breathing, or older infants or toddlers, would benefit from KC, or if it would remain effective over several procedures.

The Combined Approach to Lysis Utilizing Eptifibatide and rt-PA in Acute Ischemic Stroke-Enhanced Regimen (CLEAR-ER) trial sought to determine the safety of a higher-dose regimen and to establish evidence for a phase III trial.
METHODS: CLEAR-ER was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized safety study. Ischemic stroke patients were randomized to 0.6 mg/kg rt-PA plus eptifibatide (135 mcg/kg bolus and a 2-hour infusion at 0.75 mcg/kg per minute) versus standard rt-PA (0.9 mg/kg). The primary safety end point was the incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 36 hours. The primary efficacy outcome measure was the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score ≤1 or return to baseline mRS at 90 days. Analysis of the safety and efficacy outcomes was done with multiple logistic regression.
RESULTS: Of 126 subjects, 101 received combination therapy, and 25 received standard rt-PA. Two (2%) patients in the combination group and 3 (12%) in the standard group had symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (odds ratio, 0.15; 95% confidence interval, 0.01-1.40; P=0.053). At 90 days, 49.5% of the combination group had mRS ≤1 or return to baseline mRS versus 36.0% in the standard group (odds ratio, 1.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.70-4.31; P=0.23). After adjusting for age, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, time to intravenous rt-PA, and baseline mRS, the odds ratio was 1.38 (95% confidence interval, 0.51-3.76; P=0.52).
CONCLUSIONS: The combined regimen of intravenous rt-PA and eptifibatide studied in this trial was safe and provides evidence that a phase III trial is warranted to determine efficacy of the regimen.

Unfortunately, these substances induce sedation and have a high potential for drug abuse, and there is thus a need for alternatives. As the anxiolytic properties of lavender have already been demonstrated in pharmacological studies and small-scale clinical trials, it was postulated that lavender has a positive effect in GAD. A controlled clinical study was then performed to evaluate the efficacy of silexan, a new oral lavender oil capsule preparation, versus a benzodiazepine. In this study, the efficacy of a 6-week-intake of silexan compared to lorazepam was investigated in adults with GAD. The primary target variable was the change in the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A-total score) as an objective measurement of the severity of anxiety between baseline and week 6. The results suggest that silexan effectively ameliorates generalized anxiety comparable to a common benzodiazepine (lorazepam). The mean of the HAM-A-total score decreased clearly and to a similar extent in both groups (by 11.3+/-6.7 points (45%) in the silexan group and by 11.6+/-6.6 points (46%) in the lorazepam group, from 25+/-4 points at baseline in both groups). During the active treatment period, the two HAM-A subscores ""somatic anxiety"" (HAM-A subscore I) and ""psychic anxiety"" (HAM-A subscore II) also decreased clearly and to a similar extent in both groups. The changes in other subscores measured during the study, such as the SAS (Self-rating Anxiety Scale), PSWQ-PW (Penn State Worry Questionnaire), SF 36 Health survey Questionnaire and Clinical Global Impressions of severity of disorder (CGI item 1, CGI item 2, CGI item 3), and the results of the sleep diary demonstrated comparable positive effects of the two compounds. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that silexan is as effective as lorazepam in adults with GAD. The safety of silexan was also demonstrated. Since lavender oil showed no sedative effects in our study and has no potential for drug abuse, silexan appears to be an effective and well tolerated alternative to benzodiazepines for amelioration of generalised anxiety.",2,PRIMARY,Effects of Lavender Oil on Postoperative Pain Through Pain Scores,"Assess pain through pain scores documented in medical record compared to control group.

The sedative effect of these agents is thought to occur through supraspinal pathways, involving the locus ceruleus (LC) and its projections in rats. While the antinociceptive response to alpha(2) agonists, given intrathecally, is mediated predominantly in the spinal cord, other sites of action have not been systematically studied. The authors examined whether alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors in the LC mediate an antinociceptive effect.
METHODS: For administration of different drugs into the LC, guide cannulas were placed with their tips in the LC in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Dexmedetomidine (3.5 micrograms/0.2 microliter) was microinjected into the LC through the cannula, or given systemically by intraperitoneal injecton (50 micrograms/kg). The antinociceptive effect of dexmedetomidine was measured using the tail-flick latency response. To determine the sites through which dexmedetomidine injection into the LC produces antinociception, the authors examined whether this response could be perturbed by the specific alpha(2)-adrenergic antagonists atipamezole and L659,066 and pertussis toxin administered either into the LC or intrathecally before injection of dexmedetomidine systemically or directly into the LC. To eliminate the possibility that drug administered in one site (LC or intrathecal) could reach the other site, the dispositional characteristics of radiolabeled dexmedetomidine (LC) or atipamezole (intrathecal) were studied.
RESULTS: Dexmedetomidine placed into the LC produces a dose-dependent increase in the tail-flick latency. This antinociceptive effect was blocked by pertussis toxin and by the alpha(2) antagonists atipamezole and L659,066 placed in the LC. Intrathecal administration of atipamezole and pertussis toxin also blocked the antinociceptive effect of dexmedetomidine placed in the LC. (3)H-dexmedetomidine introduced into the LC did not reach the spinal cord in pharmacologically active concentrations; also, intrathecally administered (3)H-atipamezole did not reach the LC in appreciable amounts. The systemic administration of dexmedetomidine produced an increase in tail-flick latency, and this effect was attenuated by the injection of atipamezole and L659,066 into the LC.
CONCLUSIONS: Part of the mechanism by which dexmedetomidine produces an antinociceptive effect is by an action directly on the LC, demonstrated by these studies in which antinociception produced by injection of this drug into the LC can be blocked by specific alpha(2) antagonists injected into the LC. Furthermore, the action of dexmedetomidine in the LC in turn may result in an increase in activation of alpha(2) adrenoceptors in the spinal cord, because the antinociceptive effect of LC dexmedetomidine injection also can be blocked by intrathecal injection of antipamezole and pertussis toxin.",2,PRIMARY,Time Required After Surgery to Reach Fitness for Discharge From Hospital,No Description Available,Dexmedetomidine,Saline,"At the beginning of spinal surgery, patients will receive 1 hour dexmedetomidine intravenous bolus of 0.7 mcg/kg, followed by infusion of dexmedetomidine at a rate of 0.5 mcg/kg/hour for 2 hours, followed by an infusion of dexmedetomidine at a rate of 0.2 mcg/kg/hour for the duration of the procedure and for 4 hours after the procedure.

Additionally, to investigate the effects of sepsis on the endogenous activator of PPARgamma, 15-deoxy-(12,14)-PGJ(2) (15d-PGJ(2)), and the downstream targets of PPARgamma activity, adiponectin and resistin.
METHODS: Single-center, prospective case-control study in critically ill children with systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis or septic shock.
RESULTS: PPARgamma nuclear protein expression was decreased but PPARgamma activity was increased in PBMC from children with septic shock compared with controls. PPARgamma activity on day 1 was significantly higher in patients with higher pediatric risk of mortality (PRISM) score compared with controls [mean 0.22 optical density (OD) +/- standard error of the mean (SEM) 0.03 versus 0.12 OD +/- 0.02; p < 0.001]. Patients with resolved sepsis had increased levels of the endogenous PPARgamma ligand, 15d-PGJ(2), compared with patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and septic shock (77.7 +/- 21.7 versus 58 +/- 16.5 pg/ml; p = 0.03). Plasma high-molecular-weight adiponectin (HMWA) and resistin levels were increased in patients with septic shock on day 1 and were significantly higher in patients with higher PRISM scores. Nonsurvivors from sepsis had higher resistin levels on the first day of hospitalization compared with survivors from septic shock [660 ng/ml, interquartile range (IQR) 585-833 ng/ml versus 143 ng/ml, IQR 66-342 ng/ml; p < 0.05].
CONCLUSIONS: Sepsis is associated with altered PPARgamma expression and activity in PBMC. Plasma adipokines correlate with risk of mortality scores in sepsis and may be useful biomarkers.

METHODS: Systematic review using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Google Scholar, and 2 clinical trial registries from inception to April 2012. Randomized clinical trials comparing treatment of fever with no treatment or comparing different thresholds for fever control in adults without acute neurological injury admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) were selected for review. The effect of fever control on all-cause ICU-mortality was determined using a random effects meta-analysis.
RESULTS: Five randomized clinical trials in 399 patients were included. The temperature threshold for treatment in the intervention group was commonly 38.3°C to 38.5°C, whereas it was typically 40.0°C for controls. Four studies used physical measures and 3 used pharmacologic measures for temperature control. There was no significant heterogeneity among the included studies (I(2) = 12.5%, P = .3). Fever control did not significantly effect ICU mortality with a pooled risk ratio of 0.98 (95% confidence interval 0.58-1.63, P = .9).

Various drugs have been studied using local delivery to improve the periodontal health and to achieve periodontal regeneration. Simvastatin (SMV) is a specific competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-2-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase. The present study was designed to investigate the effectiveness of SMV, 1.2 mg, in an indigenously prepared biodegradable controlled-release gel as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) in the treatment of chronic periodontitis.
METHODS: Sixty patients were categorized into two treatment groups: SRP plus placebo (group 1) and SRP plus SMV, 1.2 mg (group 2). Clinical parameters were recorded at baseline before SRP and at 1, 2, 4, and 6 months; they included modified sulcus bleeding index (mSBI), probing depth (PD), and clinical attachment level (CAL). At baseline and after 6 months, radiologic assessment of intrabony defect (IBD) fill was done using computer-aided software. The mean concentration of SMV in gingival crevicular fluid was estimated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography.
RESULTS: All subjects tolerated the drug, without any postapplication inflammation. Both therapies resulted in significant improvements. The decrease in mSBI score at 6 months was greater in group 2 (2.3267 +/- 0.8017) compared to group 1 (0.5033 +/- 0.6815). The mean decrease in PD from baseline to 6 months was 1.20 +/- 1.24 mm and 4.26 +/- 1.59 mm in groups 1 and 2, respectively. Mean CAL gain from baseline to 6 months was 1.63 +/- 1.99 mm and 4.36 +/- 1.92 mm in groups 1 and 2, respectively. In group 2, there was greater decrease in mean IBD (1.41 +/- 0.74 mm or 32.54%) compared to group 1 (0.09 +/- 0.58 mm or 2.16%).

METHODS: A total of 334 subjects with T. cruris were enrolled and randomly assigned to NAFT-2% (n=166) or vehicle (n=168), which was applied once daily for 14 days. Efficacy and safety were evaluated at week 2 (end of treatment) and week 4. Efficacy measures included complete cure, treatment effectiveness, mycological cure, clinical cure, and clinical success and were analyzed only in subjects with a positive potassium hydroxide (KOH) and dermatophyte culture at baseline (n=75, naftifine; n=71, vehicle). Safety was assessed by adverse events and changes from baseline in clinical status and laboratory studies.
RESULTS: At week 4, 25 percent of naftifine-treated subjects achieved complete cure vs. three percent of vehicle subjects and 72 percent achieved mycological cure vs. 16 percent of vehicle treated subjects (one-sided, P<0.001). Treatment effectiveness was achieved in 60 percent of NAFT-2% subjects vs. 10 percent of vehicle subjects (one-sided, P<0.001).

A prospective, randomized clinical trial.","BACKGROUND: Failed intubation may result in both increased morbidity and mortality. The combination of a video laryngoscope and a flexible tracheoscope used as a flexible video stylet may improve the success rate of securing a difficult airway. We tested the hypothesis that this combination is a feasible way to facilitate intubation in patients with a predicted difficult airway in that it will shorten intubation times and reduce the number of intubation attempts.
METHODS: We conducted a randomized, prospective trial in 140 patients with anticipated difficult airways undergoing elective or urgent surgery. After insertion of video laryngoscope, patients were randomly assigned to either having their tube placed with the use of a preformed stylet (control group) or with a flexible tracheoscope (intervention group). The primary outcome measures were time to successful intubation and number of intubation attempts.
RESULTS: The number of intubations requiring 2 or more intubation attempts was similar in the 2 groups (14% control vs 13% intervention, P = 1.0); the number of patients requiring 3 or more intubation attempts was not significantly different (8.6% control vs 1.4% intervention, P = 0.12). Distribution for time to intubation also did not differ between the control (median of 66 seconds, interquartile range 47-89) and the intervention group (median of 71 seconds, interquartile range 52-100; P = 0.35). In the control group, 4 patients, all with cervical spine pathology, had the trachea intubated successfully with the video laryngoscope plus flexible tracheoscope after 3 failed attempts with video laryngoscope and rigid stylet. For these 4 patients, time from the decision to change the intubation method to successful intubation with a flexible tracheoscope was 36 ± 14 seconds.

CONCLUSIONS: Flexible tracheoscope-assisted video laryngoscopic intubation is a feasible alternative to video laryngoscope only intubation in patients with predicted difficult airways.

Whether early intervention can prevent development of ARDS remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of early aspirin administration for the prevention of ARDS.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial conducted at 16 US academic hospitals. Between January 2, 2012, and November 17, 2014, 7673 patients at risk for ARDS (Lung Injury Prediction Score ≥4) in the emergency department were screened and 400 were randomized. Ten patients were excluded, leaving 390 in the final modified intention-to-treat analysis cohort.
INTERVENTIONS: Administration of aspirin, 325-mg loading dose followed by 81 mg/d (n = 195) or placebo (n = 195) within 24 hours of emergency department presentation and continued to hospital day 7, discharge, or death.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the development of ARDS by study day 7. Secondary measures included ventilator-free days, hospital and intensive care unit length of stay, 28-day and 1-year survival, and change in serum biomarkers associated with ARDS. A final α level of .0737 (α = .10 overall) was required for statistical significance of the primary outcome.
RESULTS: Among 390 analyzed patients (median age, 57 years; 187 [48%] women), median (IQR) hospital length of stay was 6 (3-10) days. Administration of aspirin, compared with placebo, did not significantly reduce the incidence of ARDS at 7 days (OR, 1.24; 92.6%CI, 0.67-2.31).

The INS mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS) has well-documented efficacy and safety for the treatment and prophylaxis of nasal symptoms of seasonal AR (SAR) and for the treatment of nasal symptoms of perennial AR (PAR). Increasing interest has focused on whether INSs, including MFNS, may have beneficial effects on the ocular symptoms frequently associated with AR.
METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of 10 randomized, placebo-controlled trials of the efficacy of MFNS 200 mcg daily in relieving ocular allergy symptoms, including itching/burning, redness, and tearing/watering in both SAR and PAR. Four PAR studies and six SAR studies are included in the analysis. A fixed-effect inverse variance model was used to calculate weighted mean differences, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each comparison, and a combined overall treatment effect (Z) with P-value.
RESULTS: In both analyses of SAR and PAR studies, including 3132 patients, all individual ocular symptoms were reduced in patients treated with MFNS. Overall treatment effect was significant for all three individual ocular symptoms in the SAR studies (Z = 9.18 for tearing, Z = 10.15 for itching, and Z = 8.88 for redness; P < 0.00001 for all) and in the PAR studies (Z = 5.94, P < 0.00001 for tearing; Z = 2.43, P = 0.02 for itching; and Z = 2.42, P = 0.02 for redness).

Monitoring the efficacy of gene demethylating treatment directly within the tumour may be difficult due to tumour location. This study determined the positive and negative predictive values of sputum and serum for detecting gene methylation in primary lung cancer. A panel of eight genes was evaluated by comparing methylation detected in the primary tumour biopsy to serum and sputum obtained from 72 patients with Stage III lung cancer. The prevalence for methylation of the eight genes in sputum (21-43%) approximated to that seen in tumours, but was 0.7-4.3-fold greater than detected in serum. Sputum was superior to serum in classifying the methylation status of genes in the tumour biopsy. The positive predictive value of the top four genes (p16, DAPK, PAX5 beta, and GATA5) was 44-72% with a negative predictive value for these genes > or =70%. The highest specificity was seen for the p16 gene, and this was associated with a odds ratio of six for methylation in the tumour when this gene was methylated in sputum. In contrast, for serum, the individual sensitivity for all genes was 6-27%. Evaluating the combined effect of methylation of at least one of the four most significant genes in sputum increased the positive predictive value to 86%.

ETIFIC multicenter randomized trial.,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors), angiotensin-II-receptor-blockers (ARB), and mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists decrease mortality and heart failure (HF) hospitalizations in HF patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. The effect is dose-dependent. Careful titration is recommended. However, suboptimal doses are common in clinical practice. This study aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of dose titration of the aforementioned drugs by HF nurses vs HF cardiologists.
METHODS: ETIFIC was a multicenter (n=20) noninferiority randomized controlled open label trial. A total of 320 hospitalized patients with new-onset HF, reduced ejection fraction and New York Heart Association II-III, without beta-blocker contraindications were randomized 1:1 in blocks of 4 patients each stratified by hospital: 164 to HF nurse titration vs 156 to HF cardiologist titration (144 vs 145 analyzed). The primary endpoint was the beta-blocker mean relative dose (% of target dose) achieved at 4 months. Secondary endpoints included ACE inhibitors, ARB, and mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists mean relative doses, associated variables, adverse events, and clinical outcomes at 6 months.
RESULTS: The mean±standard deviation relative doses achieved by HF nurses vs HF cardiologists were as follows: beta-blockers 71.09%±31.49% vs 56.29%±31.32%, with a difference of 14.8% (95%CI, 7.5-22.1), P <.001; ACE inhibitors 72.61%±29.80% vs 56.13%±30.37%, P <.001; ARB 44.48%±33.47% vs 43.51%±33.69%, P=.93; and mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists 71%±32.12% vs 70.47%±29.78%, P=.86; mean±standard deviation visits were 6.41±2.82 vs 2.81±1.58, P <.001, while the number (%) of adverse events were 34 (23.6) vs 30 (20.7), P=.55; and at 6 months HF hospitalizations were 1 (0.69) vs 9 (5.51), P=.01.
CONCLUSIONS: ETIFIC is the first multicenter randomized trial to demonstrate the noninferiority of HF specialist-nurse titration vs HF cardiologist titration.

Week 12,20518806,Dapagliflozin treatment in patients with different stages of type 2 diabetes mellitus: effects on glycaemic control and body weight.,"AIM: Dapagliflozin is a stable, competitive, reversible, and highly selective inhibitor of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2, the major transporter responsible for renal glucose reabsorption. With an insulin-independent mechanism of action, dapagliflozin is currently being developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This work aims to compare the efficacy of dapagliflozin, as measured by the change in hemoglobin A1c concentration (A1c) and body weight, and to determine the pharmacodynamic effects of dapagliflozin, as measured by urinary glucose excretion in early-stage and late-stage T2DM patient populations.
METHODS: A total of 151 early-stage patients and 58 late-stage patients with T2DM randomly assigned 10 or 20 mg once daily (QD) dapagliflozin treatment or placebo for 12 weeks from two phase 2 studies were included in the analysis. A1c, body weight, and urinary glucose were compared between the two patient populations.
RESULTS: Compared with the early-stage population, patients in the late-stage population had a longer duration of T2DM and higher baseline levels of A1c, body weight, fasting plasma glucose, and urinary glucose excretion. After 12 weeks of dapagliflozin treatment, A1c reduction, weight loss, and increased urinary glucose excretion from baseline were observed in both populations. Baseline A1c level impacted the A1c reduction after dapagliflozin treatment with a comparable effect in patients with early and late stage disease. Late-stage patients had greater reduction in body weight. There was no statistically significant difference in the amount of urinary glucose excretion between the early-stage and late-stage patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin treatment at 10 and 20 mg QD for 12 weeks resulted in significant improvement in glycaemic control and body weight reduction in both early-stage and late-stage patients with T2DM.

METHODS: We conducted two integrated randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of vedolizumab in patients with active disease. In the trial of induction therapy, 374 patients (cohort 1) received vedolizumab (at a dose of 300 mg) or placebo intravenously at weeks 0 and 2, and 521 patients (cohort 2) received open-label vedolizumab at weeks 0 and 2, with disease evaluation at week 6. In the trial of maintenance therapy, patients in either cohort who had a response to vedolizumab at week 6 were randomly assigned to continue receiving vedolizumab every 8 or 4 weeks or to switch to placebo for up to 52 weeks. A response was defined as a reduction in the Mayo Clinic score (range, 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more active disease) of at least 3 points and a decrease of at least 30% from baseline, with an accompanying decrease in the rectal bleeding subscore of at least 1 point or an absolute rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1.
RESULTS: Response rates at week 6 were 47.1% and 25.5% among patients in the vedolizumab group and placebo group, respectively (difference with adjustment for stratification factors, 21.7 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 11.6 to 31.7; P<0.001). At week 52, 41.8% of patients who continued to receive vedolizumab every 8 weeks and 44.8% of patients who continued to receive vedolizumab every 4 weeks were in clinical remission (Mayo Clinic score ≤2 and no subscore >1), as compared with 15.9% of patients who switched to placebo (adjusted difference, 26.1 percentage points for vedolizumab every 8 weeks vs. placebo [95% CI, 14.9 to 37.2; P<0.001] and 29.1 percentage points for vedolizumab every 4 weeks vs. placebo [95% CI, 17.9 to 40.4; P<0.001]).

METHODS: Patients were categorized based on use of the following oral medications: opioids (with/without other oral analgesic treatments), non-opioid analgesics, and no oral analgesic treatment. We used multinomial logistic regression models to estimate adjusted relative risk ratios (RRRs) of using an opioid or a non-opioid analgesic (vs. no oral analgesic treatment), comparing patients by levels of social support (Medical Outcomes Study scale), health literacy (""How confident are you filling out medical forms by yourself?""), and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-8). Models were adjusted for demographic and clinical characteristics.
RESULTS: In this sample (mean age 64.2 years, 23.6% women), 30.6% (n = 110) reported taking opioid analgesics for OA, 54.2% (n = 195) reported non-opioid use, and 15.3% (n = 55) reported no oral analgesic use.

The primary end points were the cumulative incidence of new vertebral fracture at 24 months and the cumulative incidence of clinical fracture (nonvertebral and symptomatic vertebral fracture) at the time of the primary analysis (after clinical fractures had been confirmed in ≥330 patients). Secondary end points included the incidences of nonvertebral and hip fracture at the time of the primary analysis. Serious cardiovascular adverse events, osteonecrosis of the jaw, and atypical femoral fractures were adjudicated.
RESULTS: Over a period of 24 months, a 48% lower risk of new vertebral fractures was observed in the romosozumab-to-alendronate group (6.2% [127 of 2046 patients]) than in the alendronate-to-alendronate group (11.9% [243 of 2047 patients]) (P<0.001). Clinical fractures occurred in 198 of 2046 patients (9.7%) in the romosozumab-to-alendronate group versus 266 of 2047 patients (13.0%) in the alendronate-to-alendronate group, representing a 27% lower risk with romosozumab (P<0.001). The risk of nonvertebral fractures was lower by 19% in the romosozumab-to-alendronate group than in the alendronate-to-alendronate group (178 of 2046 patients [8.7%] vs. 217 of 2047 patients [10.6%]; P=0.04), and the risk of hip fracture was lower by 38% (41 of 2046 patients [2.0%] vs. 66 of 2047 patients [3.2%]; P=0.02). Overall adverse events and serious adverse events were balanced between the two groups. During year 1, positively adjudicated serious cardiovascular adverse events were observed more often with romosozumab than with alendronate (50 of 2040 patients [2.5%] vs. 38 of 2014 patients [1.9%]). During the open-label alendronate period, adjudicated events of osteonecrosis of the jaw (1 event each in the romosozumab-to-alendronate and alendronate-to-alendronate groups) and atypical femoral fracture (2 events and 4 events, respectively) were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who were at high risk for fracture, romosozumab treatment for 12 months followed by alendronate resulted in a significantly lower risk of fracture than alendronate alone.

Paricalcitol is less calcemic and phosphatemic in preclinical studies and in some trials in dialysis patients, but head-to-head comparisons in nondialysis patients are lacking. A large meta-analysis of trials concluded that these agents did not consistently reduce parathyroid hormone (PTH) and increased the risk of hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. Therefore, the objective of this multicenter trial was to compare the rate of hypercalcemia between calcitriol and paricalcitol, while suppressing PTH 40%-60%.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Patients with stages 3-4 CKD (n=110) with a PTH level >120 pg/ml were recruited and randomized to 0.25 μg/d of calcitriol or 1 μg/d of paricalcitol between April 2009 and July 2011. Subsequent dose adjustments were by protocol to achieve 40%-60% PTH suppression below baseline. The primary endpoint was the rate of confirmed hypercalcemia of >10.5 mg/dl between groups.
RESULTS: Forty-five patients in each group completed the 24 weeks of treatment. Both agents suppressed PTH effectively (-52% with paricalcitol and -46% with calcitriol; P=0.17), although the paricalcitol group reached a 40% reduction in PTH sooner at a median 8 weeks (interquartile range [IQR], 4, 12) versus 12 weeks (IQR, 8, 18; P=0.02) and had a lower pill burden of 240 (IQR, 180, 298) versus 292 (IQR, 231, 405; P=0.01). Confirmed hypercalcemia was very low in both groups (three with paricalcitol and one with calcitriol) and was not significantly different (P=0.36). Both groups had small increases in calcium and phosphorus levels (0.3-0.4 mg/dl in each electrolyte) and significant decreases in alkaline phosphatase, a marker of high bone turnover, with no significant differences between groups.

Results from a phase 2 study suggested that eculizumab, a terminal complement inhibitor, produced clinically meaningful improvements in patients with anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive refractory generalised myasthenia gravis. We further assessed the efficacy and safety of eculizumab in this patient population in a phase 3 trial.
METHODS: We did a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study (REGAIN) in 76 hospitals and specialised clinics in 17 countries across North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia. Eligible patients were aged at least 18 years, with a Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score of 6 or more, Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) class II-IV disease, vaccination against Neisseria meningitides, and previous treatment with at least two immunosuppressive therapies or one immunosuppressive therapy and chronic intravenous immunoglobulin or plasma exchange for 12 months without symptom control. Patients with a history of thymoma or thymic neoplasms, thymectomy within 12 months before screening, or use of intravenous immunoglobulin or plasma exchange within 4 weeks before randomisation, or rituximab within 6 months before screening, were excluded. We randomly assigned participants (1:1) to either intravenous eculizumab or intravenous matched placebo for 26 weeks. Dosing for eculizumab was 900 mg on day 1 and at weeks 1, 2, and 3; 1200 mg at week 4; and 1200 mg given every second week thereafter as maintenance dosing. Randomisation was done centrally with an interactive voice or web-response system with patients stratified to one of four groups based on MGFA disease classification. Where possible, patients were maintained on existing myasthenia gravis therapies and rescue medication was allowed at the study physician's discretion. Patients, investigators, staff, and outcome assessors were masked to treatment assignment. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline to week 26 in MG-ADL total score measured by worst-rank ANCOVA. The efficacy population set was defined as all patients randomly assigned to treatment groups who received at least one dose of study drug, had a valid baseline MG-ADL assessment, and at least one post-baseline MG-ADL assessment. The safety analyses included all randomly assigned patients who received eculizumab or placebo. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01997229.
FINDINGS: Between April 30, 2014, and Feb 19, 2016, we randomly assigned and treated 125 patients, 62 with eculizumab and 63 with placebo. The primary analysis showed no significant difference between eculizumab and placebo (least-squares mean rank 56·6 [SEM 4·5] vs 68·3 [4·5]; rank-based treatment difference -11·7, 95% CI -24·3 to 0·96; p=0·0698). No deaths or cases of meningococcal infection occurred during the study. The most common adverse events in both groups were headache and upper respiratory tract infection (ten [16%] for both events in the eculizumab group and 12 [19%] for both in the placebo group). Myasthenia gravis exacerbations were reported by six (10%) patients in the eculizumab group and 15 (24%) in the placebo group. Six (10%) patients in the eculizumab group and 12 (19%) in the placebo group required rescue therapy.
INTERPRETATION: The change in the MG-ADL score was not statistically significant between eculizumab and placebo, as measured by the worst-rank analysis. Eculizumab was well tolerated. The use of a worst-rank analytical approach proved to be an important limitation of this study since the secondary and sensitivity analyses results were inconsistent with the primary endpoint result; further research into the role of complement is needed.

We explored the usefulness of the Pleasant Events and Activity Restriction (PEAR) model for predicting multiple domains of sleep disturbance.
METHODS: Our sample consisted of 125 spousal AD caregivers. Participants completed the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and were questioned regarding the frequency with which they engaged in pleasant events and the extent to which they felt restricted in engaging in social and recreational activities in the past month. Participants were classified into one of three groups: HPLR = High Pleasant Events + Low Activity Restriction (= reference group; N = 38); HPHR/LPLR = either High Pleasant Events + High Activity Restriction or Low Pleasant Events + Low Activity Restriction (N = 52); and LPHR: Low Pleasant Events + High Activity Restriction (N = 35).

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, flexible-dose, dose-optimization study, children aged 6-12 years were randomized to receive guanfacine XR (1-4 mg/day) or placebo for 9 weeks. Screening and washout periods were followed by a 5-week dose-optimization period, a 3-week dose-maintenance period and a 1-week tapering period. The primary efficacy measure was change from baseline to endpoint in the oppositional subscale of the Conners' Parent Rating Scale-Revised: Long Form (CPRS-R:L) score. Change in ADHD Rating Scale IV (ADHD-RS-IV) total score was a secondary efficacy measure. Safety assessments included adverse events (AEs), vital signs, ECG readings and laboratory studies.
RESULTS: A total of 217 children were enrolled: 138 were randomized to receive guanfacine XR and 79 to receive placebo. Least-squares mean reductions from baseline to endpoint in CPRS-R:L oppositional subscale scores were 10.9 in the guanfacine XR group compared with 6.8 in the placebo group (p < 0.001; effect size = 0.59). A significantly greater reduction in ADHD-RS-IV total score from baseline to endpoint was also seen in the guanfacine-treated group compared with the placebo group (23.8 vs 11.5, respectively; p < 0.001; effect size = 0.92). A post hoc correlation analysis between percentage reduction from baseline to endpoint in CPRS-R:L oppositional subscale and ADHD-RS-IV total scores indicated that the decreases in oppositional symptoms and ADHD symptoms were highly correlated (r = 0.74). The most commonly reported, treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) in the guanfacine XR group were somnolence (50.7%), headache (22.1%), sedation (13.2%), upper abdominal pain (11.8%) and fatigue (11.0%) and most were mild or moderate in severity. TEAEs of sedation, somnolence or hypersomnia were experienced by 62.5% of subjects in the guanfacine XR group. These events were most common during the dose-titration period but most (63.5%) resolved prior to the taper period. TEAEs of fatigue, lethargy and asthenia were reported in 11.0%, 3.7% and 0.0% of subjects in the guanfacine XR group, respectively. Most subjects receiving guanfacine XR demonstrated modest changes in blood pressure, pulse rate and ECG readings that were not considered clinically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: In this population of children aged 6-12 years with ADHD and the presence of oppositional symptoms, significant reductions in CPRS-R:L oppositional subscale and ADHD-RS-IV total scores were observed with guanfacine XR treatment compared with placebo. Treatment with guanfacine XR at optimized doses was associated with mostly mild or moderate TEAEs. The findings of this study support the efficacy of guanfacine XR in the treatment of children with ADHD and the presence of oppositional symptoms.

This pilot study sought to explore the feasibility of improving socioeconomic inclusion outcomes by bolstering identity capital (sense of purpose and control, self-efficacy and self-esteem) among young people who had experienced homelessness.
METHODS: Nineteen individuals (aged 18-26) who had transitioned out of homelessness within the past three years participated in a six-week, six-session program focused on building identity capital. The study employed a mixed method prospective cohort hybrid design with an intervention group (Group One) and a delayed intervention comparison group (Group Two). Participants were interviewed every three months until nine months post-intervention.
RESULTS: None of the youth who began the intervention dropped out of the program, with the exception of one participant who moved across the country and was unable to continue. Immediately after participating in the intervention, Group One had statistically significant improvements (p < .05) and large to very large effect sizes in self-esteem (d = 1.16) and physical community integration (d = 1.79) compared to changes in Group Two over the same period, which had not yet begun the intervention. In the pooled analysis, small to moderate effect sizes in hopelessness, physical community integration, and self-esteem were observed at all post-intervention time points. Notably, at six- and nine-months post-intervention, statistically significant improvements (p < .05) and moderate effect sizes in hopelessness (d = -0.73 and d = -0.60 respectively) and self-esteem (d = 0.71 and d = 0.53 respectively) were observed. Youth shared they appreciated the normalizing (vs. pathologizing) of strategies they needed to learn and spoke of the importance of framing new skills as something one needs ""to have a better life"" vs. ""to get better.""

DESIGN: Randomized, controlled, double-masked trial of 225 nonsmoking patients, aged 18 to 60 years, evaluated over a 4-year interval. Patients received 12 mg of lutein or a control tablet daily. All were given 15,000 IU/d of vitamin A palmitate. Randomization took into account genetic type and baseline serum lutein level.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the total point score for the Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA) 30-2 program; prespecified secondary outcomes were the total point scores for the 60-4 program and for the 30-2 and 60-4 programs combined, 30-Hz electroretinogram amplitude, and Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study acuity.
RESULTS: No significant difference in rate of decline was found between the lutein plus vitamin A and control plus vitamin A groups over a 4-year interval for the HFA 30-2 program. For the HFA 60-4 program, a decrease in mean rate of sensitivity loss was observed in the lutein plus vitamin A group (P = .05). Mean decline with the 60-4 program was slower among those with the highest serum lutein level or with the highest increase in macular pigment optical density at follow-up (P = .01 and P = .006, respectively). Those with the highest increase in macular pigment optical density also had the slowest decline in HFA 30-2 and 60-4 combined field sensitivity (P = .005). No significant toxic effects of lutein supplementation were observed.
CONCLUSION: Lutein supplementation of 12 mg/d slowed loss of midperipheral visual field on average among nonsmoking adults with retinitis pigmentosa taking vitamin A.

The accuracy of prostate cancer detection is influenced by the length and number of biopsy cores.
METHODS: Biopsy quality factors at entry and at year 2 were compared for subjects enrolled from 6 geographic regions: North America, South America, Western Europe, Central/Eastern Europe, Australia, and Africa. Investigator training was provided for prostate biopsy collection before year 2, emphasizing core length and number of cores obtained.
RESULTS: Data were collected prospectively from 4649 subjects at entry and 6267 subjects at year 2. At entry, the aggregate length, number of cores, and mean length of cores differed significantly among regions. Aggregate length was longest in biopsies from Australia, and number of cores was highest from South America. At year 2, each region collected the protocol-required 10 cores, and aggregate length and mean length of cores were greater than for entry biopsies; site variance was reduced for all factors.
CONCLUSIONS: There were significant differences in aggregate length, number of cores, and mean length of cores among regions at study entry. After investigator training by the study sponsor and use of a central laboratory for standardized processing, year 2 biopsies showed an increase in all 3 quality factors when compared with entry biopsies.

In this study, we compared a reduction treatment approach with an immediate cessation approach in a population of ST users who reported no immediate plans to quit.
METHODS: Subjects randomly assigned to the immediate cessation condition set a quit date soon after enrollment and were offered 2 weeks of nicotine patch therapy to help in their cessation efforts. Subjects assigned to the ST reduction group were provided with their choice of either 4 mg nicotine lozenge or ST brand switching to help them reduce their ST use or levels of nicotine exposure, respectively. Quit date was 6 weeks after the onset of treatment. Follow-up was at 12 weeks and 26 weeks postenrollment and 26 weeks postquit.
RESULTS: Both 7-day point prevalence abstinence and prolonged abstinence rates following the quit date were significantly higher in the immediate cessation group versus the reduction group at 12 and 26 weeks (all p values ≤ .04) and for prolonged abstinence at 6 months postquit (p = .002). Significant reductions in ST use among nonquitters were observed for both groups (p < .0001) with no differences between groups.

Current equations have limited precision and systematically underestimate measured GFR at higher values.
OBJECTIVE: To develop a new estimating equation for GFR: the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis with separate pooled data sets for equation development and validation and a representative sample of the U.S. population for prevalence estimates.
SETTING: Research studies and clinical populations (""studies"") with measured GFR and NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey), 1999 to 2006.
PARTICIPANTS: 8254 participants in 10 studies (equation development data set) and 3896 participants in 16 studies (validation data set). Prevalence estimates were based on 16,032 participants in NHANES.
MEASUREMENTS: GFR, measured as the clearance of exogenous filtration markers (iothalamate in the development data set; iothalamate and other markers in the validation data set), and linear regression to estimate the logarithm of measured GFR from standardized creatinine levels, sex, race, and age.
RESULTS: In the validation data set, the CKD-EPI equation performed better than the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation, especially at higher GFR (P < 0.001 for all subsequent comparisons), with less bias (median difference between measured and estimated GFR, 2.5 vs. 5.5 mL/min per 1.73 m(2)), improved precision (interquartile range [IQR] of the differences, 16.6 vs. 18.3 mL/min per 1.73 m(2)), and greater accuracy (percentage of estimated GFR within 30% of measured GFR, 84.1% vs. 80.6%). In NHANES, the median estimated GFR was 94.5 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) (IQR, 79.7 to 108.1) vs. 85.0 (IQR, 72.9 to 98.5) mL/min per 1.73 m(2), and the prevalence of chronic kidney disease was 11.5% (95% CI, 10.6% to 12.4%) versus 13.1% (CI, 12.1% to 14.0%).
LIMITATION: The sample contained a limited number of elderly people and racial and ethnic minorities with measured GFR.
CONCLUSION: The CKD-EPI creatinine equation is more accurate than the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation and could replace it for routine clinical use.

A Secondary Analysis of Randomized Trial Data.,"Objective The objective of this study was to examine whether there is an association between insulin resistance and subsequent development of puerperal infection by measuring insulin resistance in the mid-trimester using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA:IR). Methods Secondary analysis of low-risk nulliparas enrolled in a multicenter preeclampsia prevention trial. HOMA:IR was measured on fasting plasma glucose and insulin concentrations among low-risk nulliparas between 22 and 26 weeks' gestation. Median HOMA:IR was compared between women who did and did not develop puerperal infection using Wilcoxon rank sum test. Logistic regression was used to control for potential confounders. Results Of 1,180 women with fasting glucose and insulin available, 121 (10.3%) had a puerperal infection. Median HOMA:IR was higher among those with subsequent puerperal infection (4.3 [interquartile, IQR: 2.2-20.5] vs. 2.6 [IQR: 1.5-6.7], p < 0.0001). After controlling for potentially confounding variables HOMA:IR was only marginally associated with an increased risk of development of puerperal infection, adjusted odds ratio: 1.01 (95% confidence interval: 1.00-1.02; p = 0.04) per unit increase. Elevated HOMA:IR performed poorly as a predictor of puerperal infection, with a positive predictive value of 15% and a negative predictive value of 92%. Conclusion Though associated with an increased risk of puerperal infection, insulin resistance, measured by HOMA:IR, is not a clinically useful predictor of puerperal infection.",2,PRIMARY,Severe or Mild Pregnancy-associated Hypertension With an Eclamptic Seizure,"Women who met more than one component of the primary outcome were counted for each component.

OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether administration of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol) to critically ill patients with sepsis would have beneficial effects on markers of innate immunity, inflammation, and kidney injury.
METHODS: We performed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, physiologic study among 67 critically ill patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. Patients were randomized to receive a single dose of calcitriol (2 μg intravenously) versus placebo. The primary outcome was plasma cathelicidin protein levels assessed 24 hours after study drug administration. Secondary outcomes included leukocyte cathelicidin mRNA expression, plasma cytokine levels (IL-10, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-1β, and IL-2), and urinary kidney injury markers.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients randomized to calcitriol (n = 36) versus placebo (n = 31) had similar plasma cathelicidin protein levels at 24 hours (P = 0.16). Calcitriol-treated patients had higher cathelicidin (P = 0.04) and IL-10 (P = 0.03) mRNA expression than placebo-treated patients 24 hours after study drug administration. Plasma cytokine levels (IL-10, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-1β, and IL-2) and urinary kidney injury markers were similar in calcitriol- versus placebo-treated patients (P > 0.05 for all comparisons). Calcitriol had no effect on clinical outcomes nor were any adverse effects observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Calcitriol administration did not increase plasma cathelicidin protein levels in critically ill patients with sepsis and had mixed effects on other immunomodulatory markers. Additional phase II trials investigating the dose and timing of calcitriol as a therapeutic agent in specific sepsis phenotypes may be warranted.

OBJECTIVE: To test the effectiveness of a stepped collaborative care intervention targeting this constellation of risk behaviors and symptoms in randomly sampled hospitalized adolescents with and without traumatic brain injury.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A pragmatic randomized clinical trial was conducted at a single US level I trauma center. Participants included 120 adolescents aged 12 to 18 years randomized to intervention (n = 59) and control (n = 61) conditions.
INTERVENTIONS: Stepped collaborative care intervention included motivational interviewing elements targeting risk behaviors and substance use as well as medication and cognitive behavioral therapy elements targeting PTSD and depressive symptoms.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Adolescents were assessed at baseline before randomization and 2, 5, and 12 months after injury hospitalization. Standardized instruments were used to assess violence risk behaviors, alcohol and drug use, and PTSD and depressive symptoms.
RESULTS: The investigation attained more than 95% adolescent follow-up at each assessment point. At baseline, approximately one-third of the participants endorsed the violence risk behavior of carrying a weapon. Regression analyses demonstrated that intervention patients experienced significant reductions in weapon carrying compared with controls during the year after injury (group × time effect, F3,344 = 3.0; P = .03). At 12 months after the injury, 4 (7.3%) intervention patients vs 13 (21.3%) control patients reported currently carrying a weapon (relative risk, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.11-0.90). The intervention was equally effective in reducing the risk of weapon carrying among injured adolescents with and without traumatic brain injury. Other treatment targets, including alcohol and drug use problems and high levels of PTSD and depressive symptoms, occurred less frequently in the cohort relative to weapon carrying and were not significantly affected by the intervention.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Collaborative care intervention reduced the risk of adolescent weapon carrying during the year after the injury hospitalization. Future investigation should replicate this preliminary observation. If the finding is replicated, orchestrated investigative and policy efforts could systematically implement and evaluate screening and intervention procedures targeting youth violence prevention at US trauma centers.

METHODS: We conducted two integrated randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of vedolizumab in patients with active disease. In the trial of induction therapy, 374 patients (cohort 1) received vedolizumab (at a dose of 300 mg) or placebo intravenously at weeks 0 and 2, and 521 patients (cohort 2) received open-label vedolizumab at weeks 0 and 2, with disease evaluation at week 6. In the trial of maintenance therapy, patients in either cohort who had a response to vedolizumab at week 6 were randomly assigned to continue receiving vedolizumab every 8 or 4 weeks or to switch to placebo for up to 52 weeks. A response was defined as a reduction in the Mayo Clinic score (range, 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more active disease) of at least 3 points and a decrease of at least 30% from baseline, with an accompanying decrease in the rectal bleeding subscore of at least 1 point or an absolute rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1.
RESULTS: Response rates at week 6 were 47.1% and 25.5% among patients in the vedolizumab group and placebo group, respectively (difference with adjustment for stratification factors, 21.7 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 11.6 to 31.7; P<0.001). At week 52, 41.8% of patients who continued to receive vedolizumab every 8 weeks and 44.8% of patients who continued to receive vedolizumab every 4 weeks were in clinical remission (Mayo Clinic score ≤2 and no subscore >1), as compared with 15.9% of patients who switched to placebo (adjusted difference, 26.1 percentage points for vedolizumab every 8 weeks vs. placebo [95% CI, 14.9 to 37.2; P<0.001] and 29.1 percentage points for vedolizumab every 4 weeks vs. placebo [95% CI, 17.9 to 40.4; P<0.001]).

Here, we examined whether reduction of plasma glucose with a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor could improve insulin-mediated tissue glucose disposal in patients with type 2 diabetes. Eighteen diabetic men were randomized to receive either dapagliflozin (n = 12) or placebo (n = 6) for 2 weeks. We measured insulin-mediated whole body glucose uptake and endogenous glucose production (EGP) at baseline and 2 weeks after treatment using the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique.

Insulin-mediated tissue glucose disposal increased by approximately 18% after 2 weeks of dapagliflozin treatment, while placebo-treated subjects had no change in insulin sensitivity. Surprisingly, following dapagliflozin treatment, EGP increased substantially and was accompanied by an increase in fasting plasma glucagon concentration. Together, our data indicate that reduction of plasma glucose with an agent that works specifically on the kidney to induce glucosuria improves muscle insulin sensitivity. However, glucosuria induction following SGLT2 inhibition is associated with a paradoxical increase in EGP. These results provide support for the glucotoxicity hypothesis, which suggests that chronic hyperglycemia impairs insulin action in individuals with type 2 diabetes.",2,PRIMARY,High Density Lipoprotein (c-HDL) Levels at Week 12.,The c-HDL levels are going to be evaluated at week 12 with enzymatic/colorimetric techniques.,Dapagliflozin,Placebo,"Dapagliflozin capsules, 10 mg, one per day before breakfast during 90 days.

In the Phosphate Reduction Evaluation of FGF23 in Early CKD Treatment (PREFECT) study, we assessed the effect of reducing intestinal phosphate absorption using lanthanum carbonate on FGF23 levels in normophosphatemic patients with CKD stage 3.
METHODS: Thirty-five individuals were randomized to lanthanum carbonate 3000 mg/day (n=23) or placebo (n=12) for 12 weeks. Levels of intact FGF23 (iFGF23), C-terminal FGF23, serum and urinary phosphate and calcium, intact parathyroid hormone and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D were assessed.
RESULTS: The median age was 65 years in the lanthanum group and 73 years in the placebo group; 58.8% and 41.7% were men, respectively. No significant difference was seen in mean iFGF23 between groups at week 12. There was, however, a transient reduction from baseline in iFGF23 in the lanthanum group at week 1, from 70.5 pg/ml to 51.9 pg/ml, which was not seen in the placebo group; this between-group difference in percentage change from baseline was significant in post hoc analyses (p=0.0102). Urinary phosphate decreased after 1 week of lanthanum treatment and remained low at week 12.
CONCLUSIONS: Reducing intestinal phosphate absorption with lanthanum carbonate did not lead to sustained reductions in iFGF23 in patients with CKD stage 3, although phosphaturia decreased. This suggests that factors other than phosphate burden may be responsible for driving increases in circulating FGF23 in patients with CKD.

OBJECTIVES: To compare LDL-C reduction using evolocumab 140 mg once every 2 weeks (Q2W) or 420 mg monthly (QM) versus lower doses (70 mg Q2W or 280 mg QM) or placebo.
METHODS: Patients received evolocumab 70 or 140 mg Q2W, 280 or 420 mg QM, or placebo Q2W or QM in two 12-week phase 2 studies: one with and one without statins. Changes from baseline in LDL-C were compared across Q2W doses and across QM doses.
RESULTS: The analysis included 741 patients. Mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) reduction in LDL-C across Q2W visits through week 12 was 63.0% (60.3% to 65.7%) for evolocumab 140 mg Q2W, compared to 41.3% (38.6% to 44.0%) for 70 mg Q2W and 1.9% (4.6% reduction to 0.8% increase) for placebo Q2W (each P < .001 vs 140 mg Q2W), and 62.7% (60.1% to 65.3%) for 420 mg QM, compared to 55.5% (52.9% to 58.0%) for 280 mg QM and 2.5% (5.1% reduction to 0.1% increase) for placebo QM (each P < .001 vs 420 mg QM). Similar results were observed at the mean of weeks 10 and 12. In a subgroup (n = 151) with weekly assessments from weeks 8 to 12, mean (95% CI) peak effect on LDL-C reduction was 72.8% (67.7% to 77.9%) for 140 mg Q2W and 69.0% (63.6% to 74.3%) for 420 mg QM. Trough effect at week 12 underestimated LDL-C reduction. Median peak-trough variability was 20.5%, 21.1%, 31.9%, and 35.1% for evolocumab 140 mg Q2W, 420 mg QM, 70 mg Q2W, and 280 mg QM, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Evolocumab 140 mg Q2W and 420 mg QM yielded similar LDL-C reduction. These doses sustained maximal LDL-C reduction, resulting in greater stability in LDL-C reduction over the dosing interval compared to lower doses.

This analysis identifies outcomes and correlates of VF in a high-risk population.
METHODS: A5251 was designed to evaluate an enhanced adherence counseling intervention delivered by nurses from a central call site on virologic suppression. Due to slow enrollment, the study was closed prematurely and revised study endpoints were evaluated (week 24 VF (HIV-1 RNA ≥200 copies/ml) and non-perfect adherence (<100% self-reported using both the ACTG adherence questionnaire and visual analog scale (VAS)).
RESULTS: Fifty-nine participants were enrolled, 43 (73%) black non-Hispanic and 23 (39%) women. Median prior antiretroviral regimen changes were three and the co-morbidity in this population was higher than typical for HIV clinical trials. At week 24 (n = 41), 24 (59%) failed to reach virologic suppression (HIV-1 RNA <200 copies/ml) and 25 (63%) reported non-perfect adherence. Higher depression (CES-D10) and adverse illness perceptions (IPQ-B) were associated with week 24 non-adherence. Early clinical assessments (week 12 HIV-RNA ≥200 copies/mL and non-perfect adherence) as well as higher depression and adverse illness perceptions were associated with week 24 VF.
DISCUSSION: In this high-risk population, the proportion of participants with suboptimal adherence and VF was unacceptably high. Interventions to address this treatment gap are clearly needed. Depression and a higher illness perception score, failure to achieve virologic suppression by week 12, and less than perfect adherence could be used to target individuals for early interventions in treatment-experienced, high-risk individuals at high risk for VF.",0,PRIMARY,Number of Participants With Virologic Suppression,"Number of participants with virologic suppression, defined as HIV-1 RNA at less than 200 copies/mL at week 48.",Enhanced Nursing Telephone Support With Standard Care,Standard Care,"Participants received enhanced nursing telephone support plus care as usual.

Mindfulness practice is an intervention that has been shown to reduce symptoms of chronic disease and improve accurate symptom assessment, both of which could result in improved disease management and increased wellness for people with COPD. A randomized controlled trial was conducted to investigate an 8-week mindful meditation intervention program tailored for the COPD population and explore the use of breathing timing parameters as a possible physiological measure of meditation uptake. Results demonstrated that those randomized to the mindful meditation intervention group (N=19) had a significant increase in respiratory rate over time as compared to those randomized to the wait-list group (N=22) (P=0.045). It was also found that the mindful meditation intervention group demonstrated a significant decrease in level of mindfulness over time as compared to the wait-list group (P=0.023). When examining participants from the mindful meditation intervention who had completed six or more classes, it was found that respiratory rate did not significantly increase in comparison to the wait-list group. Furthermore, those who completed six or more classes (N=12) demonstrated significant improvement in emotional function in comparison to the wait-list group (P=0.032) even though their level of mindfulness did not improve.

BACKGROUND: Randomized trials have demonstrated an excellent safety and efficacy profile for the CoCr-EES. The PtCr-EES uses the identical antiproliferative agent and polymer but with a novel platinum chromium scaffold designed for enhanced deliverability, vessel conformability, side-branch access, radiopacity, radial strength, and fracture resistance.
METHODS: A total of 1,530 patients undergoing PCI of 1 or 2 de novo native lesions were randomized at 132 worldwide sites to CoCr-EES (n = 762) or PtCr-EES (n = 768). The primary endpoint was the 12-month rate of target lesion failure (TLF), the composite of target vessel-related cardiac death, target vessel-related myocardial infarction (MI), or ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization (TLR) in the per-protocol population (patients who received ≥1 assigned study stent), powered for noninferiority.
RESULTS: The 12-month rate of TLF in the per-protocol population occurred in 2.9% versus 3.4% of patients assigned to CoCr-EES versus PtCr-EES, respectively (difference: 0.5%, 95% confidence interval: -1.3% to 2.3%, p(noninferiority) = 0.001, p(superiority) = 0.60).

METHODS: Infants (N = 76) between 34 and 60 weeks' postmenstrual age with acid reflux index > 3% were randomly allocated to study (acid-suppressive therapy + feeding bundle) or conventional (acid-suppressive therapy only) arms for 4 weeks. Feeding bundle included: total fluid volume < 140 mL/kg/day, fed over 30 min in right lateral position, and supine postprandial position. Primary outcome was independent oral feeding and/or ≥6-point decrease in symptom score (I-GERQ-R). Secondary outcomes included growth (weight, length, head circumference), length of hospital stay (LOHS, days), airway (oxygen at discharge), and developmental (Bayley scores) milestones.
RESULTS: Of 688 screened: 76 infants were randomized and used for the primary outcome as intent-to-treat, and secondary outcomes analyzed for 72 infants (N = 35 conventional, N = 37 study). For study vs. conventional groups, respectively: (a) 33% (95% CI, 19-49%) vs. 44% (95% CI, 28-62%), P = 0.28 achieved primary outcome success, and (b) secondary outcomes did not significantly differ (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Feeding strategy modifications concurrent with acid suppression are not superior to PPI alone in improving GERD symptoms or discharge feeding, short-term and long-term outcomes.
IMPACT: Conservative feeding therapies are thought to modify GERD symptoms and its consequences. However, in this randomized controlled trial in convalescing neonatal ICU infants with GERD symptoms, when controlling for preterm or full-term birth and severity of esophageal acid reflux index, the effectiveness of acid suppression plus a feeding modification bundle (volume restriction, intra- and postprandial body positions, and prolonged feeding periods) vs. acid suppression alone, administered over a 4-week period was not superior in improving symptom scores or feeding outcomes. Restrictive feeding strategies are of no impact in modifying GERD symptoms or clinically meaningful outcomes. Further studies are needed to define true GERD and to identify effective therapies in modifying pathophysiology and outcomes.

METHOD: HIV+ patients with clinically significant fatigue were treated in a placebo-controlled randomized double-blind trial for 4 weeks. Armodafinil responders and placebo non-responders or relapsers were treated openly for a total of 16 weeks with armodafinil. The primary outcome measure for fatigue and depression was the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement Scale, supplemented by the Fatigue Severity Scale, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and the Beck Depression Inventory. Safety was assessed with assays of CD4 cell count and HIV RNA viral load and the SAFTEE side effects rating scale. Maximum trial dose of armodafinil was 250 mg/d.
RESULTS: Seventy patients were enrolled. Attrition was 9%. In intention-to-treat analyses, fatigue response rate to armodafinil was 75% and to placebo, 26%. Armodafinil did not reduce depressive symptoms in the absence of improved energy, but of those patients with an Axis I depressive disorder at study entry whose energy improved, 82% experienced improved mood as well.

At Month 6, there was a significant effect of nalmefene compared with placebo in reducing the number of heavy drinking days (-2.3 days [95% confidence interval:-3.8 to-.8]; p = .0021) and total alcohol consumption (-11.0 g/day [95% confidence interval:-16.8 to-5.1]; p = .0003). Improvements in Clinical Global Impression and liver enzymes were larger in the nalmefene group compared with placebo at Week 24. Adverse events (most mild or moderate) and dropouts due to adverse events were more common with nalmefene than placebo. The number of patients with serious adverse events was similar in the two groups.

BoNT/A is believed to be effective against itch as it inhibits the release of acetylcholine as well as some other substances that may be involved in itch.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of subcutaneous administration of BoNT/A on experimentally histamine-induced itch in human skin.
METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 14 healthy men (mean +/- SD age 26.3 +/- 2.6 years) received BoNT/A (Botox; Allergan, Irvine, CA, U.S.A.; 5 U) and isotonic saline on the volar surface of either forearm. Histamine prick tests were performed four times at the treatment sites (before treatment, and days 1, 3 and 7 after treatment). The itch intensity (as rated on a 0-10 visual analogue scale), itch area, neurogenic inflammation (visible flare area), blood flow (laser Doppler) and cutaneous temperature (thermographic images) were measured over the course of the trials.
RESULTS: BoNT/A reduced the histamine-induced itch intensity (F(1,39) = 30.2, P < 0.001) and itch area (F(1,39) = 8.8, P = 0.011) compared with saline at all time points after treatment. The duration of itch was also shorter for BoNT/A-treated areas (F(1,39) = 19.4, P < 0.001), with a peak effect at day 7. The flare area was smaller in the BoNT/A-treated arm compared with the saline-treated arm at all time points after treatment (F(1,39) = 15.4, P = 0.002). Findings from blood flow (F(1,26) = 177.3, P < 0.001) and temperature measurements (F(1,26) = 27.6, P < 0.001) clearly showed the suppressive effect of BoNT/A on vasomotor reactions, with the maximal effect on days 3 and 7.
CONCLUSIONS: BoNT/A reduced the itch intensity, blood flow and neurogenic inflammation in response to the histamine prick test in human skin.

Intravenous sodium nitrite, which is converted to nitric oxide in vivo, improves hemodynamics in HFpEF, but its use is limited by the need for parenteral administration. Nitrite can also be administered using a novel, portable micronebulizer system suitable for chronic use.
OBJECTIVE: Determine whether inhaled nitrite improves hemodynamics in HFpEF.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial, subjects with HFpEF (n=26) underwent cardiac catheterization with simultaneous expired gas analysis at rest and during exercise before and after treatment with inhaled sodium nitrite (90 mg) or placebo. The primary end point was the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure during exercise. Before study drug administration, HFpEF subjects displayed an increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure with exercise from 20±6 to 34±7 mm Hg (P<0.0001). After study drug administration, exercise pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was substantially improved by nitrite as compared with placebo (baseline-adjusted mean 25±5 versus 31±6 mm Hg; analysis of covariance P=0.022). Inhaled nitrite reduced resting pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (-4±3 versus -1±2 mm Hg; P=0.002), improved pulmonary artery compliance (+1.5±1.1 versus +0.6±0.9 mL/mm Hg), and decreased mean pulmonary artery pressures at rest (-7±4 versus -3±4 mm Hg; P=0.007) and with exercise (-10±6 versus -5±6 mm Hg; P=0.05). Nitrite reduced right atrial pressures, with no effect on cardiac output or stroke volume.
CONCLUSIONS: Acute administration of inhaled sodium nitrite reduces biventricular filling pressures and pulmonary artery pressures at rest and during exercise in HFpEF. Further study is warranted to evaluate chronic effects of inhaled nitrite in HFpEF.

METHOD: Inclusive, double-blind, randomized, controlled, 8-week, parallel-group trial, conducted October 17, 2005 through January 30, 2009 in 8 Canadian academic and psychiatric clinics. Adult outpatients (N = 432) with MDE (Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview, version 5.0.0, criteria) lasting at least 4 weeks, including 40.3% taking antidepressants at baseline, were randomly assigned to 8 weeks of 1,050 mg/d of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 150 mg/d of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) or matched sunflower oil placebo (2% fish oil). The primary outcome was the self-report Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-SR(30)); the secondary outcome was the clinician-rated Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS).
RESULTS: The adjusted mean difference between treatment and placebo was 1.32 points (95% CI, -0.20 to 2.84; P = .088) on the IDS-SR(30) and 0.97 points (95% CI, -0.012 to 1.95; P = .053) on the MADRS. Planned subgroup analyses revealed a significant interaction of comorbid anxiety disorders and study group (P = .035). For patients without comorbid anxiety disorders (n = 204), omega-3 supplementation was superior to placebo, with an adjusted mean difference of 3.17 points on the IDS-SR(30) (95% CI, 0.89 to 5.45; P = .007) and 1.93 points (95% CI, 0.50 to 3.36; P = .008) on the MADRS.
CONCLUSIONS: In this heterogeneous sample of patients with MDE, there was only a trend toward superiority of omega-3 supplementation over placebo in reducing depressive symptoms. However, there was a clear benefit of omega-3 supplementation among patients with MDE without comorbid anxiety disorders.

Clinical guidelines from the National Kidney Foundation-Kidney/Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative emphasize the need to control parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, and phosphorus levels in patients with CKD not receiving dialysis to reduce poor outcomes. This phase 2 study evaluated the effects of the oral calcimimetic cinacalcet hydrochloride in patients with CKD not on dialysis therapy.
METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 18-week study enrolled adults with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 15 to 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 (0.25 to 0.83 mL/s/1.73 m2) and an intact PTH (iPTH) level greater than 130 pg/mL (ng/L). Cinacalcet (or placebo) was titrated from 30 to 180 mg once daily to obtain a 30% or greater reduction in iPTH levels from baseline.
RESULTS: Baseline mean iPTH levels were 243 pg/mL (ng/L) in the cinacalcet group (n = 27) and 236 pg/mL (ng/L) in the control group (n = 27). At baseline, 28% of subjects were being administered vitamin D sterols and 43% were being administered phosphate binders or calcium supplements. The addition of cinacalcet significantly decreased iPTH concentrations compared with controls during the efficacy-assessment phase: 56% versus 19% of subjects achieved a 30% or greater reduction in iPTH levels (P = 0.006), and mean iPTH levels decreased by 32% in the cinacalcet group, but increased by 6% in the control group (P < 0.001).

METHODS: We performed 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. In healthy volunteers (20 per group), we evaluated the effects of oral placebo, 500 mg, or 1000 mg of CDC (delayed-release, each given for 4 days) on gastrointestinal and colonic transit. A second trial compared the effects of colesevelam (1.875 g, twice daily) versus placebo in 24 patients (12 per group) with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) on transit, daily bowel frequency and consistency, and colonic mucosal permeability. Serum fasting 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (7alphaC4) was measured to screen for bile acid malabsorption. Effects of treatments on transit were compared using analysis of covariance with body mass index and 7alphaC4 as covariates.
RESULTS: In healthy volunteers, CDC significantly accelerated colonic transit (at 24 and 48 hours, P = .01 and P < .0001, respectively), increased stool frequency and ease of passage (both P < .001), and evacuation (P = .02), and decreased stool consistency (P < .001). Four of the 24 IBS-D patients had increased serum 7alphaC4 levels. In IBS-D, colesevelam modestly affected overall colonic transit (24 h; P = .22). Emptying of the ascending colon took an average of 4 hours longer in patients given colesevelam compared with placebo; treatment effect was associated with baseline serum 7alphaC4 levels (P = .0025).

Gardening and healthy eating are priorities in the Navajo Nation. Collaborations between researchers and local partners supported the design and implementation of this project.
DESIGN: The Yéego! Healthy Eating and Gardening Study was a group-randomized controlled trial to evaluate a school-based healthy eating and gardening intervention in 6 schools in the Navajo Nation. Schools were randomized 1:2 to intervention or comparison.
SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: The Shiprock and Tsaile/Chinle areas in the Navajo Nation were selected. Elementary schools were screened for eligibility. All students in third and fourth grades were invited to participate in the assessments.
INTERVENTION: Delivered during 1 school year in the intervention schools, the intervention included a culturally relevant nutrition and gardening curriculum and a school garden.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Student self-efficacy for eating fruits and vegetables, student self-efficacy for gardening, and student healthy foods score from a modified Alternative Healthy Eating Index were assessed in third and fourth graders at the beginning and end of a school year affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Primary analyses used repeated measures linear mixed models accounting for students nested within schools to estimate the intervention effect and 95% CIs.
RESULTS: Students in the intervention schools had self-efficacy scores for eating fruits and vegetables that were 0.22 points greater (95% CI=0.04, 0.41) than those in the comparison schools, although the student healthy foods score increased in the intervention schools by 2.0 (95% CI=0.4, 3.6); the differential change was modest at 1.7 (95% CI=-0.3, 3.7). The self-efficacy to grow fruits and vegetables in the school garden increased among those in the intervention schools (OR=1.92; 95% CI=1.02, 3.63) but not significantly more than it increased in the comparison schools (OR=1.29; 95% CI=0.60, 2.81).
CONCLUSIONS: The intervention was efficacious in improving self-efficacy for eating fruits and vegetables among third- and fourth-grade students over a school year. The findings warrant further evaluation of the intervention in larger-group randomized trials with schools in Navajo communities.

DESIGN: Randomized, clinical trial.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 58 children aged 3 to <7 years with IXT. Eligibility criteria included a distance control score of 2 or worse (mean of 3 measures during a single examination) on a scale of 0 (exophoria) to 5 (constant exotropia) and spherical equivalent refractive error between -6.00 diopters (D) and +1.00 D.
METHODS: Children were randomly assigned to overminus spectacles (-2.50 D over cycloplegic refraction) or observation (non-overminus spectacles if needed or no spectacles) for 8 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was distance control score for each child (mean of 3 measures during a single examination) assessed by a masked examiner at 8 weeks. Outcome testing was conducted with children wearing their study spectacles or plano spectacles for the children in the observation group who did not need spectacles. The primary analysis compared mean 8-week distance control score between treatment groups using an analysis of covariance model that adjusted for baseline distance control, baseline near control, prestudy spectacle wear, and prior IXT treatment.

Managing adult patients' pain postoperatively has been challenging due to increased chest wall rigidity and the pressure required for supporting the elevated sternum. The optimal pain management regimen has not been determined. We designed this prospective, randomized trial to compare postoperative pain management and outcomes between thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) and bilateral subcutaneous infusion pump catheters (On-Q).
METHODS: Patients undergoing MIRPE (modified Nuss) underwent random assignment to TEA or On-Q group. Both groups received intravenous, patient-controlled opioid analgesia, with concomitant delivery of local anesthetic. Primary outcomes were length of stay (LOS), opioid use, and pain scores.
RESULTS: Of 85 randomly assigned patients, 68 completed the study [52 men, 76.5%; mean (range) age, 32.2 (20.0-58.0) years; Haller index, 5.9 (range, 3.0-26.7)]. The groups were equally matched for preoperative variables; however, the On-Q arm had more patients (60.3%). No significant differences were found between groups in mean daily pain scores (P=0.52), morphine-equivalent opioid usage (P=0.28), or hospital stay 3.5 vs. 3.3 days (TEA vs. On-Q; P=0.55). Thirteen patients randomized to TEA refused the epidural and withdrew from the study because they perceived greater benefit of the On-Q system.
CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative pain management in adults after MIRPE can be difficult. Both continuous local anesthetic delivery by TEA and On-Q catheters with concomitant, intravenous, patient-controlled anesthesia maintained acceptable analgesia with a reasonable LOS.

METHODS: We performed a randomized trial of infants who were less than 6 hours of age and had a gestational age of at least 36 weeks and perinatal asphyxial encephalopathy. We compared intensive care plus cooling of the body to 33.5 degrees C for 72 hours and intensive care alone. The primary outcome was death or severe disability at 18 months of age. Prespecified secondary outcomes included 12 neurologic outcomes and 14 other adverse outcomes.
RESULTS: Of 325 infants enrolled, 163 underwent intensive care with cooling, and 162 underwent intensive care alone. In the cooled group, 42 infants died and 32 survived but had severe neurodevelopmental disability, whereas in the noncooled group, 44 infants died and 42 had severe disability (relative risk for either outcome, 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68 to 1.07; P=0.17). Infants in the cooled group had an increased rate of survival without neurologic abnormality (relative risk, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.16 to 2.12; P=0.003). Among survivors, cooling resulted in reduced risks of cerebral palsy (relative risk, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.96; P=0.03) and improved scores on the Mental Developmental Index and Psychomotor Developmental Index of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II (P=0.03 for each) and the Gross Motor Function Classification System (P=0.01). Improvements in other neurologic outcomes in the cooled group were not significant. Adverse events were mostly minor and not associated with cooling.

Although other explanations are possible, these cognitive deficits appear to reflect a disturbance in executive control, the processes that facilitate complex information processing and behavior and that include context representation and maintenance, functions dependent on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Studies in non-human primates indicate that normal working memory function depends upon appropriate GABA neurotransmission in the DLPFC, and alterations in markers of GABA neurotransmission are well documented in the DLPFC of subjects with schizophrenia.
OBJECTIVES: Thus, the purpose of this paper is to review the nature of the altered GABA neurotransmission in the DLPFC in schizophrenia, and to consider how these findings might inform the search for new treatments for cognitive dysfunction in this illness.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Postmortem studies suggest that markers of reduced GABA neurotransmission in schizophrenia may be selective for, or at least particularly prominent in, the subclass of GABA neurons, chandelier cells, that provide inhibitory input to the axon initial segment of populations of pyramidal neurons. Given the critical role that chandelier cells play in synchronizing the activity of pyramidal neurons, the pharmacological amelioration of this deficit may be particularly effective in normalizing the neural network activity required for working memory function. Because GABA(A) receptors containing the a(2) subunit are selectively localized to the axon initial segment of pyramidal cells, and appear to be markedly up-regulated in schizophrenia, treatment with novel benzodiazepine-like agents with selective activity at GABA(A) receptors containing the a(2) subunit may be effective adjuvant agents for improving working memory function in schizophrenia.",2,PRIMARY,N-back Task - Reaction Time,"The N-back task is a sequential-letter memory task for which working memory load is varied, as the respondent must indicate when the current stimulus matches the one from 'n' steps earlier in the sequence.

METHODS: Study subjects were adults with schizophrenia who started on oral open-label iloperidone titrated to an initial target dose of 12 mg/day (6 mg twice daily) and then stabilized on a flexible-dose iloperidone regimen (range 8-24 mg/day) for up to 24 weeks. Subjects meeting stabilization criteria then entered the relapse-prevention phase and were randomized 1:1 in a double-blind fashion to continue with iloperidone or placebo withdrawal for up to 26 weeks or until meeting relapse or other withdrawal criteria.
RESULTS: A total of 303 subjects were randomized to the relapse-prevention phase; 153 continued to receive iloperidone, and 150 were withdrawn to placebo. The modal total daily dose for iloperidone in all phases of the study was 12 mg/day. The pre-defined unblinded interim analysis upon reaching 68 relapse events confirmed the hypothesis that iloperidone (n = 97) was more effective than placebo (n = 96) in preventing relapse events, and the trial was stopped early. The estimated relapse rates were 63.4 % (Kaplan-Meier [KM] estimate) for placebo compared with 20.4 % (KM estimate) for those continuing to receive iloperidone (log rank test: p < 0.0001). The mean time to relapse was 71 days for placebo and 139 days for iloperidone (hazard ratio 4.7; 95 % confidence interval 2.7-8.3; p < 0.0001). The safety profile observed in previous short-term studies was also reaffirmed in this maintenance treatment setting. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in the stabilization phase were dizziness (11.6 %), somnolence (8.3 %), and dry mouth (6.8 %). Rates of reported extrapyramidal disorder or akathisia during stabilization were 2.5 and 3.7 %, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Flexible dosing of iloperidone for maintenance-phase therapy, with a modal dose of 12 mg/day was effective in preventing relapse in subjects previously stabilized on iloperidone.

We estimated whether uterine artery Doppler measurements made in the early second trimester would predict the subsequent development of preeclampsia.
METHODS: Uterine artery Doppler measurements before 21 weeks of gestation (median 16.6 weeks) were correlated with subsequent development of preeclampsia in a cohort of 2,188 low-risk nulliparous women in a randomized control trial of antioxidant supplementation for prevention of preeclampsia. Preeclampsia developed in 165 (7.5%) women.
RESULTS: Development of preeclampsia overall was associated with increased resistance index, pulsatility index, a pulsatility index or resistance index multiple of the median at or above the 75th percentile but not the presence of a notch or a bilateral notch before 21 weeks of gestation. The sensitivity was 43% (95% confidence interval [CI] 35-51) and specificity 67% (95% CI 65-69) for prediction of preeclampsia overall. The presence of a notch or bilateral notch, resistance index, and pulsatility index multiple of the median was significantly associated with early onset (before 34 weeks of gestation) compared with late onset or no preeclampsia (odds ratio [OR] 6.9, 95% CI 2.3-20.9; sensitivity 78%, 95% CI 52-94; specificity 66%, 95% CI 64-68). The presence of a notch or resistance index multiple of the median at or above the 75th percentile increased the odds of developing severe compared with mild or no preeclampsia (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.4-3.7; sensitivity 53%, 95% CI 40-65; specificity 66%, 95% CI 64-68).
CONCLUSION: Our data show poor sensitivity of second-trimester Doppler ultrasound measurements for prediction of preeclampsia overall in a well-characterized, low-risk, nulliparous population. The technique has utility in identifying poor trophoblast invasion of spiral arteries of a magnitude that severely compromises uteroplacental blood flow and gives early-onset disease.

The aims of treatment of infection associated with internal fixation devices are fracture consolidation and prevention of chronic osteomyelitis. Complete biofilm eradication is not the primary goal, as remaining adherent microorganisms can be removed with the device after fracture consolidation. By contrast, in periprosthetic joint infection (PJI), biofilm elimination is required. Surgical treatment of PJI includes debridement with retention, one- or two-stage exchange and removal without reimplantation. In addition, prolonged antibiotic treatment, preferably with an agent that is effective against biofilm bacteria, is required. Rifampicin is an example of an antibiotic with these properties against staphylococci. However, to avoid the emergence of resistance, rifampicin must always be combined with another antimicrobial agent. With this novel treatment approach, orthopaedic implant-associated infection is likely to be eradicated in up to 80-90% of patients. Because most antibiotics have a limited effect against biofilm infections, novel prophylactic and therapeutic options are needed. Surface coating with antimicrobial peptides that reduce bacterial attachment and biofilm formation can potentially prevent implant-associated infection.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the analgesic efficacy of adjunctive Sativex (Δ
METHODS: This report describes two phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Eligible patients had advanced cancer and average pain numerical rating scale (NRS) scores ≥4 and ≤8 at baseline, despite optimized opioid therapy. In Study-1, patients were randomized to Sativex or placebo, and then self-titrated study medications over a 2-week period per effect and tolerability, followed by a 3-week treatment period. In Study-2, all patients self-titrated Sativex over a 2-week period. Patients with a ≥15% improvement from baseline in pain score were then randomized 1:1 to Sativex or placebo, followed by 5-week treatment period (randomized withdrawal design).
RESULTS: The primary efficacy endpoint (percent improvement (Study-1) and mean change (Study-2) in average daily pain NRS scores) was not met in either study. Post hoc analyses of the primary endpoints identified statistically favourable treatment effect for Sativex in US patients <65 years (median treatment difference: 8.8; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.00-17.95; p = 0.040) that was not observed in patients <65 years from the rest of the world (median treatment difference: 0.2; 95% CI: -5.00 to 7.74; p = 0.794).

Fosmetpantotenate is in clinical development as a replacement therapy that targets the underlying cause of pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration. The FOsmetpantotenate Replacement Therapy pivotal trial-an ongoing phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial-examines the efficacy and safety of fosmetpantotenate in patients with pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration aged 6-65 years. The FOsmetpantotenate Replacement Therapy trial required the development and validation of a novel patient-reported outcome measure specifically relevant to pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration. The Pantothenate Kinase-Associated Neurodegeneration-Activities of Daily Living scale was developed to assess activities of daily living related to motor functioning in patients with pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration to evaluate clinically meaningful change as the primary efficacy endpoint in clinical trials. This article describes the design of the FOsmetpantotenate Replacement Therapy pivotal trial and the development of the Pantothenate Kinase-Associated Neurodegeneration-Activities of Daily Living scale.
METHODS: A systematic, iterative process consistent with the US Food and Drug Administration guidance and advice from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use at the European Medicines Agency was used to evaluate and adapt or remove scale items of an existing widely used instrument for movement disorders to be pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration-specific, and to create new items. Modification of scale items was based on input from international experts, patient advocacy leaders, and primary caregivers. A clinimetric study of the Pantothenate Kinase-Associated Neurodegeneration-Activities of Daily Living scale conducted in patients with pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration or their caregivers (N = 40 at first assessment; N = 39 at second assessment) demonstrated high content and construct validity and excellent test-retest reliability over an approximately 2-week period. The Pantothenate Kinase-Associated Neurodegeneration-Activities of Daily Living scale was developed to be broadly useful within clinical and research settings in the examination of patient response to pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration therapies.
RESULTS: Approximately 82 patients will be enrolled in the ongoing FOsmetpantotenate Replacement Therapy pivotal trial. Change from baseline in Pantothenate Kinase-Associated Neurodegeneration-Activities of Daily Living score over the 24-week double-blind period is the primary efficacy endpoint for the FOsmetpantotenate Replacement Therapy trial. Treatment effect will be evaluated using a mixed model for repeated measures analysis to assess data from all visits simultaneously.
CONCLUSION: The development and implementation of the Pantothenate Kinase-Associated Neurodegeneration-Activities of Daily Living scale in the FOsmetpantotenate Replacement Therapy trial illustrates the feasibility and potential patient benefit of putting into practice the current regulatory guidance on the use of patient-reported outcomes in clinical trials. These processes can be broadly applied to clinical trial methodology that requires newly created or revised patient-reported outcome measures to evaluate outcome change as a primary efficacy endpoint.

Delivered via partnerships between Veterans Affairs medical centers and Alzheimer's Association chapters, PDC targeted both patients and caregivers, distinguishing it from many non-pharmacological interventions. Hypotheses posited PDC would improve five veteran self-reported outcomes: 1) unmet need, 2) embarrassment about memory problems, 3) isolation, 4) relationship strain and 5) depression. Greater impact was expected for more impaired veterans. A unique feature was self-reported research data collected from veterans with dementia.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Five matched communities were study sites. Two randomly selected sites received PDC for 12 months; comparison sites received usual care. Three structured telephone interviews were completed every 6 months with veterans who could participate.
RESULTS: Of 508 consenting veterans, 333 (65.6%) completed baseline interviews. Among those who completed baseline interviews, 263 (79.0%) completed 6-month follow-ups and 194 (58.3%) completed 12-month follow-ups. Regression analyses showed PDC veterans had significantly less adverse outcomes than those receiving usual care, particularly for more impaired veterans after 6 months, including reduced relationship strain (B = -0.09; p = 0.05), depression (B = -0.10; p = 0.03), and unmet need (B = -0.28; p = 0.02; and B = -0.52; p = 0.08). PDC veterans also had less embarrassment about memory problems (B = -0.24; p = 0.08). At 12 months, more impaired veterans had further reductions in unmet need (B = -0.96; p < 0.01) and embarrassment (B = -0.05; p = 0.02). Limitations included use of matched comparison sites rather than within-site randomization and lack of consideration for variation within the PDC group in amounts and types of assistance provided.
CONCLUSIONS: Partnerships between community and health organizations have the potential to meet the dementia-related needs and improve the psychosocial functioning of persons with dementia.

Each session lasts 90 minutes. The first session orients participants to the structure and philosophy of the program, provides a historical overview of PTSD, and introduces the concept of the ""survival mode"" of functioning (Chemtob et al., 1997). The remaining 11 sessions follow a standard format: 1) practice relaxation training (15-20 minutes); 2) review homework, introduce new material, and engage in group activities focused on implementing new skills and behaviors (70-80 minutes); and 3) review problems or concerns of group members.","Present Centered Therapy (PCT) is an active, manualized treatment comparison condition for psychotherapy trials.

Safety and efficacy of mipomersen in patients with severe hypercholesterolemia was evaluated.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial. Patients (n  = 58) were ≥18 years with LDL-C ≥7.8 mmol/L or LDL-C ≥5.1 mmol/L plus CHD disease, on maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy that excluded apheresis. Weekly subcutaneous injections of mipomersen 200 mg (n  = 39) or placebo (n  = 19) were added to lipid-lowering therapy for 26 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOME: percent reduction in LDL-C from baseline to 2 weeks after the last dose of treatment. Mipomersen (n = 27) reduced LDL-C by 36%, from a baseline of 7.2 mmol/L, for a mean absolute reduction of 2.6 mmol/L. Conversely, mean LDL-C increased 13% in placebo (n = 18) from a baseline of 6.5 mmol/L (mipomersen vs placebo p<0.001). Mipomersen produced statistically significant (p<0.001) reductions in apolipoprotein B and lipoprotein(a), with no change in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Mild-to-moderate injection site reactions were the most frequently reported adverse events with mipomersen. Mild-to-moderate flu-like symptoms were reported more often with mipomersen. Alanine transaminase increase, aspartate transaminase increase, and hepatic steatosis occurred in 21%, 13% and 13% of mipomersen treated patients, respectively. Adverse events by category for the placebo and mipomersen groups respectively were: total adverse events, 16(84.2%), 39(100%); serious adverse events, 0(0%), 6(15.4%); discontinuations due to adverse events, 1(5.3%), 8(20.5%) and cardiac adverse events, 1(5.3%), 5(12.8%).
CONCLUSION: Mipomersen significantly reduced LDL-C, apolipoprotein B, total cholesterol and non-HDL-cholesterol, and lipoprotein(a). Mounting evidence suggests it may be a potential pharmacologic option for lowering LDL-C in patients with severe hypercholesterolemia not adequately controlled using existing therapies.

The aim of this review was to systematically analyse the evidence regarding the effectiveness of this novel training modality in clinical MSK rehabilitation.
DESIGN: This is a systematic review and meta-analysis of peer-reviewed literature examining BFR training in clinical MSK rehabilitation (Research Registry; researchregistry91).
DATA SOURCES: A literature search was conducted across SPORTDiscus (EBSCO), PubMed and Science Direct databases, including the reference lists of relevant papers. Two independent reviewers extracted study characteristics and MSK and functional outcome measures. Study quality and reporting was assessed using the Tool for the assEssment of Study qualiTy and reporting in EXercise.
ELIGIBILITY: Search results were limited to exercise training studies investigating BFR training in clinical MSK rehabilitation, published in a scientific peer-reviewed journal in English.
RESULTS: Twenty studies were eligible, including ACL reconstruction (n=3), knee osteoarthritis (n=3), older adults at risk of sarcopenia (n=13) and patients with sporadic inclusion body myositis (n=1). Analysis of pooled data indicated low-load BFR training had a moderate effect on increasing strength (Hedges' g=0.523, 95% CI 0.263 to 0.784, p<0.001), but was less effective than heavy-load training (Hedges' g=0.674, 95% CI 0.296 to 1.052, p<0.001).

Antidepressants are useful for its treatment, but whether they can also be used for prevention has yet to be established.
METHOD: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of escitalopram for preventing interferon alfa-2a-induced depression, we conducted an investigator-initiated multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 133 chronic hepatitis C patients without baseline mental disorders who were randomly assigned to receive escitalopram or placebo during the first 12 weeks of treatment. Primary efficacy outcomes were the development of DSM-IV major depression and scores on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Primary safety end points were biochemical and virological responses. Patients were recruited between March 2005 and July 2006.
RESULTS: Rates of major depression were low (5.4%) and did not differ between placebo (3.2%) and escitalopram (7.6%). MADRS and HADS scores significantly increased during treatment (P < .001 and P = .028, respectively), but there were no differences between treatment groups. Sustained virological response was achieved by 69.2% of patients, 70.4% in the placebo group and 67.9% in the escitalopram group.

Numerous mutations and polymorphisms in the gene encoding AGT have been identified, but in only a few cases has the causal relationship between genotype and phenotype actually been demonstrated. In this study, we have determined the effects of the most common naturally occurring amino acid substitutions (both normal polymorphisms and disease-causing mutations) on the properties, especially specific catalytic activity, of purified recombinant AGT. The results presented in this paper show the following: 1) normal human His-tagged AGT can be expressed at high levels in Escherichia coli and purified in a correctly folded, dimerized and catalytically active state; 2) presence of the common P11L polymorphism decreases the specific activity of purified recombinant AGT by a factor of three; 3) AGTs containing four of the most common PH1-specific mutations (G41R, F152I, G170R, and I244T) are all soluble and catalytically active in the absence of the P11L polymorphism, but in its presence all lead to protein destabilization and aggregation into inclusion bodies; 4) naturally occurring and artificial amino acid substitutions that lead to peroxisome-to-mitochondrion AGT mistargeting in mammalian cells also lead to destabilization and aggregation in E. coli; and 5) the PH1-specific G82E mutation abolishes AGT catalytic activity by interfering with cofactor binding, as does the artificial K209R mutation at the putative site of cofactor Shiff base formation.

The safety and efficacy of testosterone treatment in older men who have limitations in mobility have not been studied.
METHODS: Community-dwelling men, 65 years of age or older, with limitations in mobility and a total serum testosterone level of 100 to 350 ng per deciliter (3.5 to 12.1 nmol per liter) or a free serum testosterone level of less than 50 pg per milliliter (173 pmol per liter) were randomly assigned to receive placebo gel or testosterone gel, to be applied daily for 6 months. Adverse events were categorized with the use of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities classification. The data and safety monitoring board recommended that the trial be discontinued early because there was a significantly higher rate of adverse cardiovascular events in the testosterone group than in the placebo group.
RESULTS: A total of 209 men (mean age, 74 years) were enrolled at the time the trial was terminated. At baseline, there was a high prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and obesity among the participants. During the course of the study, the testosterone group had higher rates of cardiac, respiratory, and dermatologic events than did the placebo group. A total of 23 subjects in the testosterone group, as compared with 5 in the placebo group, had cardiovascular-related adverse events. The relative risk of a cardiovascular-related adverse event remained constant throughout the 6-month treatment period.

METHODS: Data were analyzed for 134 adults 60 years or older with insomnia and apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of less than 15 who were randomized to a larger study of CBTI versus a sleep education control. Sleep outcomes (sleep onset latency, total wake time, wake after sleep onset, sleep efficiency, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) were compared between CBTI and control at 6 months using repeated-measures analysis of variance adjusted for baseline values. AHI of 5 or greater versus less than 5 was included as an interaction term to evaluate changes in sleep outcomes. The number of participants at baseline and 6 months with mild SDB for whom insomnia was their only other indication for PAP was also compared between CBTI and control.
RESULTS: AHI status (AHI ≥ 5 [75.5% of participants] versus AHI < 5) did not moderate improvements in sleep associated with CBTI (all p values ≥ .12). Nine (45.0%) of 20 participants with mild SDB for whom insomnia was their only other indication for PAP therapy at baseline no longer had another indication for PAP at 6 months, with no significant difference between CBTI and control.

2204,NCT01659021,Idelalisib+Ofatumumab is superior to Ofatumumab in terms of Progression-Free Survival Randomization to End of Study (up to 60 months),28257752,"Efficacy and safety of idelalisib in combination with ofatumumab for previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia: an open-label, randomised phase 3 trial.","BACKGROUND: Idelalisib, a selective inhibitor of PI3Kδ, is approved for the treatment of patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) in combination with rituximab. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of idelalisib in combination with a second-generation anti-CD20 antibody, ofatumumab, in a similar patient population.
METHODS: In this global, open-label, randomised, controlled phase 3 trial, we enrolled patients with relapsed CLL progressing less than 24 months from last therapy. Patients refractory to ofatumumab were excluded. Patients were stratified by relapsed versus refractory disease, presence or absence of del(17p) or TP53 mutation, or both, and IGHV mutated versus unmutated. We randomised patients in a 2:1 ratio using a web-based interactive system that generated a unique treatment code, and assigned patients to receive either idelalisib plus ofatumumab (oral idelalisib 150 mg twice daily continuously plus ofatumumab 300 mg intravenously in week 1, then 1000 mg intravenously weekly for 7 weeks, and every 4 weeks for 16 weeks) or ofatumumab alone (ofatumumab dosing as per the combination group, except 2000 mg was substituted for the 1000 mg dose). An independent review committee assessed response, including progressive disease, based on imaging using modified International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia 2008 criteria. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival assessed by an independent review committee in the intention-to-treat population. We did a primary analysis (data cutoff Jan 15, 2015) and an updated analysis (data cutoff Sept 1, 2015). This trial is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT01659021.
FINDINGS: Between Dec 17, 2012, and March 31, 2014, we enrolled 261 patients (median age 68 years [IQR 61-74], median previous therapies three [IQR 2-4]). At the primary analysis, median progression-free survival was 16·3 months (95% CI 13·6-17·8) in the idelalisib plus ofatumumab group and 8·0 months (5·7-8·2) in the ofatumumab group (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0·27, 95% CI 0·19-0·39, p<0·0001). The most frequent grade 3 or worse adverse events in the idelalisib plus ofatumumab group were neutropenia (59 [34%] patients vs 14 [16%] in the ofatumumab group), diarrhoea (34 [20%] vs one [1%]), and pneumonia (25 [14%] vs seven [8%]). The most frequent grade 3 or worse adverse events in the ofatumumab group were neutropenia (14 [16%]), pneumonia (seven [8%]), and thrombocytopenia (six [7%] vs 19 [11%] in the idelalisib plus ofatumumab group). Serious infections were more common in the idelalisib plus ofatumumab group and included pneumonia (23 [13%] patients in the idelalisib plus ofatumumab group vs nine [10%] in the ofatumumab group), sepsis (11 [6%] vs one [1%]), and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (eight [5%] vs one [1%]). 22 treatment-related deaths occurred in the idelalisib plus ofatumumab group (the most common being sepsis, septic shock, viral sepsis, and pneumonia). Six treatment-related deaths occurred in the ofatumumab group (the most common being progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and pneumonia).
INTERPRETATION: The idelalisib plus ofatumumab combination resulted in better progression-free survival compared with ofatumumab alone in patients with relapsed CLL, including in those with high-risk disease, and thus might represent a new treatment alternative for this patient population.

Extending treatment with an aromatase inhibitor to 10 years may further reduce the risk of breast-cancer recurrence.
METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the effect of the extended use of letrozole for an additional 5 years. Our primary end point was disease-free survival.
RESULTS: We enrolled 1918 women. After a median follow-up of 6.3 years, there were 165 events involving disease recurrence or the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (67 with letrozole and 98 with placebo) and 200 deaths (100 in each group). The 5-year disease-free survival rate was 95% (95% confidence interval [CI], 93 to 96) with letrozole and 91% (95% CI; 89 to 93) with placebo (hazard ratio for disease recurrence or the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer, 0.66; P=0.01 by a two-sided log-rank test stratified according to nodal status, prior adjuvant chemotherapy, the interval from the last dose of aromatase-inhibitor therapy, and the duration of treatment with tamoxifen). The rate of 5-year overall survival was 93% (95% CI, 92 to 95) with letrozole and 94% (95% CI, 92 to 95) with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.97; P=0.83). The annual incidence rate of contralateral breast cancer in the letrozole group was 0.21% (95% CI, 0.10 to 0.32), and the rate in the placebo group was 0.49% (95% CI, 0.32 to 0.67) (hazard ratio, 0.42; P=0.007). Bone-related toxic effects occurred more frequently among patients receiving letrozole than among those receiving placebo, including a higher incidence of bone pain, bone fractures, and new-onset osteoporosis. No significant differences between letrozole and placebo were observed in scores on most subscales measuring quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: The extension of treatment with an adjuvant aromatase inhibitor to 10 years resulted in significantly higher rates of disease-free survival and a lower incidence of contralateral breast cancer than those with placebo, but the rate of overall survival was not higher with the aromatase inhibitor than with placebo.

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of two-dimensional (2D) and 3D visualization on surgical skills and task performance.
METHODS: In this study, 34 individuals with varying laparoscopic experience (18 inexperienced individuals) performed three tasks to test spatial relationships, grasping and positioning, dexterity, precision, and hand-eye and hand-hand coordination. Each task was performed in 3D using binocular vision for open performance, the Viking 3Di Vision System for laparoscopic performance, and the DaVinci robotic system. The same tasks were repeated in 2D using an eye patch for monocular vision, conventional laparoscopy, and the DaVinci robotic system.
RESULTS: Loss of 3D vision significantly increased the perceived difficulty of a task and the time required to perform it, independently of the approach (P < 0.0001-0.02).

Furthermore, there are concerns that tranexamic acid may have prothrombotic and proconvulsant effects.
METHODS: In a trial with a 2-by-2 factorial design, we randomly assigned patients who were scheduled to undergo coronary-artery surgery and were at risk for perioperative complications to receive aspirin or placebo and tranexamic acid or placebo. The results of the tranexamic acid comparison are reported here. The primary outcome was a composite of death and thrombotic complications (nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism, renal failure, or bowel infarction) within 30 days after surgery.
RESULTS: Of the 4662 patients who were enrolled and provided consent, 4631 underwent surgery and had available outcomes data; 2311 were assigned to the tranexamic acid group and 2320 to the placebo group. A primary outcome event occurred in 386 patients (16.7%) in the tranexamic acid group and in 420 patients (18.1%) in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.81 to 1.05; P=0.22). The total number of units of blood products that were transfused during hospitalization was 4331 in the tranexamic acid group and 7994 in the placebo group (P<0.001). Major hemorrhage or cardiac tamponade leading to reoperation occurred in 1.4% of the patients in the tranexamic acid group and in 2.8% of the patients in the placebo group (P=0.001), and seizures occurred in 0.7% and 0.1%, respectively (P=0.002 by Fisher's exact test).
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients undergoing coronary-artery surgery, tranexamic acid was associated with a lower risk of bleeding than was placebo, without a higher risk of death or thrombotic complications within 30 days after surgery.

OBJECTIVES: This enriched, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study evaluated the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of BTDS in opioid-naïve patients who had moderate to severe chronic low back pain.
METHODS: Patients who tolerated and responded to BTDS (10 or 20 mcg/hour) during an open-label run-in period were randomized to continue BTDS 10 or 20 mcg/hour or receive matching placebo. The primary outcome was ""average pain over the last 24 hours"" at the end of the 12-week double-blind phase, collected on an 11-point scale (0=no pain, 10=pain as bad as you can imagine).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A randomized controlled 3-month trial was conducted with two post-treatment assessments of 200 breast cancer survivors assigned to either 12 weeks of 90-minute twice per week hatha yoga classes or a wait-list control. The main outcome measures were lipopolysaccharide-stimulated production of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and scores on the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF), the vitality scale from the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form (SF-36), and the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale.
RESULTS: Immediately post-treatment, fatigue was not lower (P > .05) but vitality was higher (P = .01) in the yoga group compared with the control group.

An injection of autologous blood might provide the necessary cellular and humoral mediators to induce a healing cascade. The purpose of this study was to evaluate prospectively the results of refractory lateral epicondylitis treated with autologous blood injections.
METHOD: Twenty-eight patients with lateral epicondylitis were injected with 2 mL of autologous blood under the extensor carpi radialis brevis. All patients had failed previous nonsurgical treatments including all or combinations of physical therapy, splinting, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication, and prior steroid injections. Patients kept personal logs and rated their pain (0-10) and categorized themselves according to Nirschl staging (0-7) daily.
RESULTS: The average follow-up period was 9.5 months (range, 6-24 mo). After autologous blood injections the average pain score decreased from 7.8 to 2.3. The average Nirschl stage decreased from 6.5 to 2.0. For the 9 patients receiving more than one blood injection the mean pain score and Nirschl stage before injection were 7.2 and 6.6, respectively. After the second blood injection the pain and Nirschl scores were both 0.9. Two patients received a third blood injection that brought both pain and Nirschl scores to 0.

Different techniques of sternal closure have been described. Rigid fixation of the sternum results in earlier union. We measured the rigidity of sternotomy fixation using a mechanical model in order to differentiate different techniques of sternal closure using their biomechanical characteristics.
METHODS: We measured the force-displacement curves of six different fixation techniques using a metal sternal model using a computerized materials-testing machine. We tested straight wires (the most commonly used surgical technique), figure-of-8 wires, 'repair' technique (used when a wire breaks), Ethibond, Sterna-band and a 'multitwist' closure described for the first time.
RESULTS: At 20 kg force, twisted wires used for sternotomy closures start to untwist. The most rigid closure was a multitwist closure that displaced only 0.37 mm at a force of 20 kg. Straight wires displaced 0.78 mm, figure-of-8 wires 1.20 mm, Sterna-band 1.37 mm, repair wires 5.08 mm, Ethibond 9.37 mm. The single factor Anova test for the rigidity of the different closures had P-values <0.0001.

2931,NCT01203046,GROUP B - 3 DAYS THERAPY is non-inferior or equivalent to GROUP A: 7 DAYS THERAPY in terms of Surgical Site Infection 10 days,10204554,The duration of antibiotic administration in penetrating abdominal trauma.,"BACKGROUND: The epidemiology of penetrating abdominal trauma is changing to reflect an increasing incidence of multiple injuries. Not only do multiple injuries increase the risk of infection, a very high risk of serious infection is conferred by immunosuppression from hemorrhage and transfusion and the high likelihood of intestinal injury, especially to the colon. Optimal timing and choice of presumptive antibiotic therapy has been established for penetrating trauma, but duration has not been studied extensively in such seriously injured patients. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that 24 hours of antibiotic therapy remains sufficient to reduce the incidence of infection in penetrating abdominal trauma.
METHODS: Three hundred fourteen consecutive patients with penetrating abdominal trauma were prospectively randomized into two groups: Group I received 24 hours of intravenous cefoxitin (1 g q6h) and group II received 5 days of intravenous cefoxitin. The development of a deep surgical site (intra-abdominal) infection as well as any type of nosocomial infection, as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, (ie, surgical site infections, catheter-related infections, urinary tract, pneumonia), was recorded. Hospital length of stay was a secondary endpoint. Statistical analysis included chi-square tests for coordinate variables and two-tailed unpaired t tests for continuous variables. The independence of risk factors for the development of infection was assessed by multivariate analysis of variance. Significance was determined when P <0.05.
RESULTS: Three hundred patients were evaluable. There was no postoperative mortality, and no differences in overall length of hospitalization between groups. The duration of antibiotic treatment had no influence on the development of any infection (P = 0.136) or an intraabdominal infection (P = 0.336). Only colon injury was an independent predictor of the development of an intraabdominal infection (P = 0.0031). However, the overall infection incidence was affected by preoperative shock (P = 0.003), colon (P = 0.0004), central nervous system (CNS) injuries (P = 0.031), and the number of injured organs (P = 0.026). Several factors, including intraoperative shock (P = 0.021) and injuries to the colon (P = 0.0008), CNS (P = 0.0001), and chest (P = 0.0006), were independent contributors to prolongation of the hospital stay.
CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-four hours of presumptive intravenous cefoxitin versus 5 days of therapy made no difference in the prevention of postoperative infection or length of hospitalization. Infection was associated with shock on admission to the emergency department, the number of intra-abdominal organs injured, colon injury specifically, and injury to the central nervous system. Intra-abdominal infection was predicted only by colon injury.

We reviewed efficacy and safety data of dexamethasone for prevention of PONV. A systematic search (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, hand searching, bibliographies, all languages, up to April 1999) was done for full reports of randomized comparisons of dexamethasone with other antiemetics or placebo in surgical patients. Relevant end points were prevention of early PONV (0 to 6 h postoperatively), late PONV (0 to 24 h), and adverse effects. Data from 1,946 patients from 17 trials were analyzed: 598 received dexamethasone; 582 received ondansetron, granisetron, droperidol, metoclopramide, or perphenazine; 423 received a placebo; and 343 received a combination of dexamethasone with ondansetron or granisetron. With placebo, the incidence of early and late PONV was 35% and 50%, respectively. Sixteen different regimens of dexamethasone were tested, most frequently, 8 or 10 mg IV in adults, and 1 or 1.5 mg/kg IV in children. With these doses, the number needed to treat to prevent early and late vomiting compared with placebo in adults and children was 7.1 (95% CI 4.5 to 18), and 3.8 (2.9 to 5), respectively. In adults, the number needed to treat to prevent late nausea was 4.3 (2.3 to 26). The combination of dexamethasone with ondansetron or granisetron further decreased the risk of PONV; the number needed to treat to prevent late nausea and vomiting with the combined regimen compared with the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists alone was 7.7 (4.8 to 19) and 7.8 (4.1 to 66), respectively. There was a lack of data from comparisons with other antiemetics for sensible conclusions. There were no reports on dexamethasone-related adverse effects.
IMPLICATIONS: When there is a high risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting, a single prophylactic dose of dexamethasone is antiemetic compared with placebo, without evidence of any clinically relevant toxicity in otherwise healthy patients. Late efficacy seems to be most pronounced. It is very likely that the best prophylaxis of postoperative nausea and vomiting currently available is achieved by combining dexamethasone with a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist.

The objective of the current study was to examine whether vitamin D replacement improves insulin sensitivity.
METHODS: In this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study, 12 healthy subjects with plasma 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25[OH]D) levels of less than 20 ng/mL were treated with ergocalciferol, 50,000 units, orally once a week for 8 weeks or matching placebo. The main outcome measure was insulin-stimulated glucose infusion rate during the last 20 minutes of a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic glucose clamp study.

This study investigated whether cigarette demand predicted response to contingent monetary rewards for abstinence among individuals with substance use disorders. It also sought to replicate evidence for greater price sensitivity at whole-dollar pack price transitions (ie, left-digit effects).
METHODS: Participants (N = 338) were individuals in residential substance use disorder treatment who participated in a randomized controlled trial that compared contingent vouchers to noncontingent vouchers for smoking abstinence. Baseline demand indices were used to predict number of abstinent days during the 14-day voucher period (after the reduction lead-in) and at 1 and 3 months afterward.
RESULTS: Demand indices correlated with measures of smoking and nicotine dependence. As measured by elasticity, intensity and O max, higher demand significantly predicted fewer abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings during voucher period for individuals in the noncontingent vouchers condition. Breakpoint exhibited a trend-level association with abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings. Demand indices did not predict abstinence in the contingent vouchers group, and did not predict abstinence at 1- and 3-month follow-ups. Left-digit price transitions were associated with significantly greater reductions in consumption.
CONCLUSIONS: The association of cigarette demand with smoking behavior only in the group for whom abstinence was not incentivized indicates that CPT assesses the value of smoking more than the value of money per se and that vouchers counteract the effects of the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes. Results provide initial short-term evidence of predictive validity for the CPT indices.
IMPLICATIONS: This study provides the first evidence of the validity of the CPT for predicting early response to brief advice for smoking cessation plus nicotine replacement in smokers with substance dependence. However, demand for cigarettes did not predict voucher-based treatment response, indicating that incentives serve as a powerful motivator not to smoke that acts in opposition to the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes and that the indices reflect the value of smoking more than the value of money per se.",0,PRIMARY,Average Number of Cigarettes Per Day,Timeline Followback interview assessing number of cigarettes on each day of each 3-month reporting period,Contingency Management (CM),Noncontingent Reinforcement (NR),"Condition provides contingent monetary reinforcement for smoking reductions (first 5 days) then for smoking abstinence (subsequent 14 days).

While the majority of the motor Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) items can be conducted visually, rigidity and retropulsion pull testing require hands-on assessment by the rater and are less feasible to perform remotely in patients' homes.
METHODS: In a secondary data analysis of the Comparison of the Agonist pramipexole vs. Levodopa on Motor complications in Parkinson's Disease (CALM-PD) study, a randomized clinical trial, we assessed the cross-sectional (baseline and 2 years) and longitudinal (change from baseline to 2 years) reliability of a modified motor UPDRS (removing rigidity and retropulsion items) compared to the standard motor UPDRS (all items) using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), stratified by treatment group. Internal consistency of the modified UPDRS (mUPDRS) was measured using Cronbach's alpha, and concurrent validity was assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) between the standard motor UPDRS and mUPDRS.
RESULTS: The mUPDRS versus standard motor UPDRS is cross-sectionally (ICC ≥ 0.92) and longitudinally (ICC ≥ 0.92) reliable for both treatment groups. High internal consistencies were also observed (α ≥ 0.96). The mUPDRS had high concurrent validity with the standard UPDRS at both time points and longitudinally (r ≥ 0.93, p < 0.0001).

To characterize more thoroughly the change in muscle activation patterns of people with LBP in response to a perturbation of standing balance, and to gain insight into the influence of early- vs. late-phase postural responses (differentiated by estimates of voluntary reaction times), this study evaluated the intermuscular patterns of electromyographic (EMG) activations from 24 people with and 21 people without a history of chronic, recurrent LBP in response to 12 directions of support surface translations. Two-factor general linear models examined differences between the 2 subject groups and 12 recorded muscles of the trunk and lower leg in the percentage of trials with bursts of EMG activation as well as the amplitudes of integrated EMG activation for each perturbation direction. The subjects with LBP exhibited 1) higher baseline EMG amplitudes of the erector spinae muscles before perturbation onset, 2) fewer early-phase activations at the internal oblique and gastrocnemius muscles, 3) fewer late-phase activations at the erector spinae, internal and external oblique, rectus abdominae, and tibialis anterior muscles, and 4) higher EMG amplitudes of the gastrocnemius muscle following the perturbation. The results indicate that a history of LBP associates with higher baseline muscle activation and that EMG responses are modulated from this activated state, rather than exhibiting acute burst activity from a quiescent state, perhaps to circumvent trunk displacements.",2,PRIMARY,Change From Baseline to 6 Months in Oswestry Disability Scale (0-100%),Disability; Sacle 0-100% Lower score is considered better/improved; Negative value indicates improvement,Stabilization,Strengthening and Conditioning,"Stabilization

Stabilization exercise protocol: The stabilization exercise protocol consists of exercises focused on improving the ability of trunk muscles to stabilize the spine, beginning with training to isolate the deeper abdominal muscles as well as deep dorsal trunk muscles. Then patients were progressed to exercises that added leverage of the limbs while maintaining the co-contraction of the deeper abdominal muscles and deep dorsal trunk muscles while breathing normally. Various positions (e.g., supine and quadruped positions) were used to challenge the patients based on their tolerance. Finally, patients were progressed to exercises in more functional positions that included tasks/activities that were reported as challenging and/or painful; patients performed the tasks at the speed demanded by the particular task. Maintenance of the co-contraction of deep trunk muscles was emphasized during these functional activities.","Strength and conditioning exercise protocol: This protocol contained trunk strengthening and endurance exercises. It consisted of 3 phases: 1) initial strengthening of trunk flexors/extensors in single plane movements, 2) trunk and lower-extremity stretching as well as progression of trunk-strengthening exercises to include multi-planar trunk movements. Aerobic exercises were progressed as tolerated and patient education about body biomechanics were reinforced, and 3) trunk-strengthening exercises under dynamic conditions (e.g., unstable support surface and in multi-planar trunk movements). During the 10 week protocol, exercises became more challenging, and each subject had to complete at least the first phase before moving onto the next phase in order to be included in post-testing analyses. There was no specific focus on the deep abdominal or deep dorsal trunk muscles during any of these exercises.",OTHER,OTHER,EXPERIMENTAL,ACTIVE_COMPARATOR,['0.0038'],['Mixed Models Analysis'],['Superiority'],2011-Nov-N/A

We developed a patient-family agenda setting intervention to engage family in cancer care communication.
METHODS: We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial (NCT03283553) of patients on active treatment for breast cancer and their family ""care partner."" Intervention dyads (n = 69) completed a self-administered checklist to clarify care partner roles, establish a shared visit agenda, and facilitate MyChart patient portal access. Control dyads (n = 63) received usual care. We assessed intervention acceptability and initial effects from post-visit surveys and MyChart utilization at 6 weeks.
RESULTS: At baseline, most patients (89.4%) but few care partners (1.5%) were registered for MyChart. Most patients (79.4%) wanted their care partner to have access to their records and 39.4% of care partners reported accessing MyChart. In completing the checklist, patients and care partners endorsed active communication roles for the care partner and identified a similar visit agenda: most (> 90%) reported the checklist was easy, useful, and recommended it to others. At 6 weeks, intervention (vs control) care partners were more likely to be registered for MyChart (75.4% vs 1.6%; p < 0.001), to have logged in (43.5% vs 0%; p < 0.001) and viewed clinical notes (30.4% vs 0%; p < 0.001), but were no more likely to exchange direct messages with clinicians (1.5% vs 0%; p = 0.175).

External cephalic version can be effective in repositioning the fetus in a cephalic presentation, but may be painful for the mother. Our aim was to assess the efficacy of remifentanil versus placebo for pain relief during external cephalic version.
METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, controlled trial that included women at 36-41 weeks of gestation with non-cephalic presentations was performed. Women were randomized to receive either a remifentanil infusion at 0.1 μg/kg/min and demand boluses of 0.1 μg/kg, or saline placebo. The primary outcome was the numerical rating pain score (0-10) after external cephalic version.
RESULTS: Sixty women were recruited, 29 in the control group and 31 in the remifentanil group. There were significant differences in pain scores at the end of the procedure (control 6.5 ± 2.4 vs. remifentanil 4.7 ± 2.5, P = 0.005) but not 10 min later (P = 0.054). The overall success rate for external cephalic version was 49% with no significant differences between groups (remifentanil group 54.8% vs. control group 41.3%, P = 0.358). In the remifentanil group, there was one case of nausea and vomiting, one of drowsiness and three cases of fetal bradycardia. In the control group, there were three cases of nausea and vomiting, one of dizziness and nine cases of fetal bradycardia.

A better short-term appetite control has been described in active compared to sedentary men, and an exercise intervention was shown to improve appetite control in previously sedentary individuals. The mechanisms whereby exercise improves short-term appetite control remain obscure and although the changes in the postprandial release of satiety peptides are attractive hypotheses, it remains unproven. The impact of exercise on habitual food intake is also controversial and likely to be dependent on restraint level and body weight.

This trial evaluates the efficacy and safety of tralokinumab, an IL-13-neutralising antibody, as add-on therapy in adults with moderate-to-severe UC despite standard treatments.
DESIGN: Non-hospitalised adults with UC (total Mayo score ≥6) were randomised to receive tralokinumab 300 mg or placebo subcutaneously every 2 weeks for 12 weeks. The primary end point was the rate of clinical response at week 8. Secondary efficacy end points included clinical remission and mucosal healing rates at week 8 and changes in total Mayo score, total modified Riley score, partial Mayo score and disease activity markers.
RESULTS: Clinical response rate was 38% (21/56) for tralokinumab vs. 33% (18/55) for placebo (p=0.406). Clinical remission rate was 18% (10/56) vs. 6% (3/55) (p=0.033) and mucosal healing rate was 32% (18/56) vs. 20% (11/55) (p=0.104) for tralokinumab vs placebo. Changes to week 8 in total Mayo score and total modified Riley score were similar for tralokinumab and placebo (least-squares mean difference between groups: -0.49 (p=0.394) and 0.25 (p=0.449), respectively). Partial Mayo score at week 4 was lower with tralokinumab than placebo (least-squares mean difference between groups: -0.90 (p=0.041)). No consistent patterns were observed for disease activity markers. Tralokinumab had an acceptable safety profile.
CONCLUSIONS: Add-on therapy with tralokinumab did not significantly improve clinical response. However, the higher clinical remission rate with tralokinumab than placebo suggests that tralokinumab may benefit some patients with UC. Tralokinumab was well tolerated.

METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial of vitamins C and E in nulliparous low-risk women. Maternal weight gain from prepregnancy (self-reported) to 15-18 weeks of gestation was measured, and expected gestational weight gain was determined using the Institute of Medicine 2009 guidelines for each prepregnancy body mass index category. Excessive early gestational weight gain was defined as gestational weight gain greater than the upper range of the Institute of Medicine guidelines. Rates of GDM, birth weight greater than 4,000 g, and large for gestational age (LGA, birth weight 90 percentile or higher) were calculated and compared between women with excessive early gestational weight gain and early nonexcessive gestational weight gain (within or below Institute of Medicine guidelines).
RESULTS: A total of 7,985 women were studied. Excessive early gestational weight gain occurred in 47.5% of women. Ninety-three percent of women with excessive early gestational weight gain had total gestational weight gain greater than Institute of Medicine guidelines. In contrast, only 55% of women with nonexcessive early gestational weight gain had total gestational weight gain greater than Institute of Medicine guidelines (P<.001). Rates of GDM, LGA, and birth weight greater than 4,000 g were higher in women with excessive early gestational weight gain.
CONCLUSION: In our population, excessive early gestational weight gain occurred in 93% of women who had total gestational weight gain greater than the Institute of Medicine guidelines. In low-risk nulliparous women, excessive early gestational weight gain is associated with the development of GDM and excessive fetal growth.

None of the subjects exhibited clinical movement disorder characteristic of Huntington's disease. Of the 54 subjects, 22 were Huntington's disease mutation carriers and 32 were non-carriers. On a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests previously shown to be sensitive to the early stages of clinical Huntington's disease, Huntington's disease mutation carriers exhibited highly specific cognitive deficits. In particular, Huntington's disease mutation carriers performed significantly less well than non-carriers, matched for age and IQ, on tests of attentional set shifting and semantic verbal fluency. Furthermore, performance on these two tests was significantly correlated, even after partialling out the effects of age and IQ. It is suggested that these cognitive impairments relate to a common deficit in inhibitory control mechanisms, under the control of striatofrontal mechanisms, and that such a deficit is present in Huntington's disease mutation carriers prior to the onset of definite motor symptomatology.

METHODS: In a randomised, open-label study, 121 healthy women, 18-50 years of age, were randomly assigned to receive NOMAC/E2 (2.5 mg/1.5 mg) in a 24/4-day regimen (n=60) or LNG/EE (150 μg/30 μg) in a 21/7-day regimen (n=61) for six cycles. The primary outcome was the change from baseline to cycle 6 for all indices.
RESULTS: All parameters were similar at baseline between the two groups. Over six cycles, NOMAC/E2 had less effect on most haemostatic indices than LNG/EE. Lipids were essentially unchanged with NOMAC/E2, whereas with LNG/EE high-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides slightly increased. NOMAC/E2 induced negligible changes in glucose and insulin parameters, in contrast to LNG/EE. A much smaller increase in CRP was observed with NOMAC/E2 than with LNG/EE. NOMAC/E2 was associated with a greater increase in SHBG.

Self-report questionnaires (SRQs), by contrast, are inexpensive, easy to administer, and hence, may be useful for 'diagnosing' nonadherence. In this study, we evaluated the validity of two commonly used medication adherence SRQs among patients with uncontrolled hypertension, using electronic pillbox measurement as the gold standard.
METHODS: A total of 149 patients with uncontrolled hypertension had adherence to their antihypertensive medication regimen monitored using a four-compartment electronic pillbox (MedSignals) between two primary care visits (median 50 days). Participants completed the 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8) and the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at the second visit. Likelihood ratios were calculated using less than 80% correct dosing adherence by electronic measurement as the gold standard.
RESULTS: SRQ scores indicating low adherence (MMAS-8 <6 and VAS <80%, 23 and 9% of participants, respectively) had likelihood ratios of 2.00 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10-3.65] and 7.72 (95% CI 1.77-33.6), respectively, for detecting nonadherence compared to electronic measurement. SRQ scores indicating highest adherence (MMAS-8 = 8 and VAS = 100%, 43 and 61% of participants, respectively) had likelihood ratios of 0.55 (95% CI 0.35-0.85) and 0.76 (95% CI 0.57-1.01), respectively, for detecting nonadherence.

METHODS: This was a phase IIa, randomized, active-comparator-controlled, parallel-group, open-label study. A magnetic resonance imaging-estimated proton density fat fraction assessment was performed to determine LFC at screening and Week 24. Participants with an LFC of ≥10% at screening were randomized 1:1 to efinopegdutide 10 mg or semaglutide 1 mg, both administered subcutaneously once weekly for 24 weeks. Participants were stratified according to the concurrent diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Both drugs were titrated to the target dose over an 8-week time period.

RESULTS: Among 145 randomized participants (efinopegdutide n = 72, semaglutide n = 73), 33.1% had T2DM. At baseline, mean BMI was 34.3 kg/m
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with NAFLD, treatment with efinopegdutide 10 mg weekly led to a significantly greater reduction in LFC than semaglutide 1 mg weekly.

IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: Currently, there are no approved therapies for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The weight loss associated with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists has been shown to decrease hepatic inflammation in patients with NASH. In addition to reducing liver fat content (LFC) indirectly through weight loss, glucagon receptor agonism may also reduce LFC by acting on the liver directly to stimulate fatty acid oxidation and reduce lipogenesis. This study demonstrated that treatment of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease with the GLP-1/glucagon receptor co-agonist efinopegdutide (10 mg weekly) led to a significantly greater reduction in LFC compared to treatment with the GLP-1 receptor agonist semaglutide (1 mg weekly), suggesting that efinopegdutide may be an effective treatment for NASH.",1,PRIMARY,"Mean Relative Reduction From Baseline in Liver Fat Content (LFC) Measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Estimated Proton Density Fat Fraction (MRI-PDFF), Evaluated by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) After 24 Weeks",LFC was measured with liver images taken by MRI-PDFF and analyzed by BICR.

Omarigliptin is a once-weekly dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor. The purpose of this trial was to assess the efficacy and safety of adding omarigliptin to the treatment regimen of patients with T2D inadequately controlled by dual therapy with metformin and glimepiride.
METHODS: Patients with T2D and HbA1c ≥7.5% and ≤10.5% while on metformin (≥1500 mg/day) and glimepiride (≥4 mg/day) were randomized to omarigliptin 25 mg once-weekly (N = 154) or placebo (N = 153) for 24 weeks. The primary objective was to assess whether omarigliptin was superior to placebo in reducing HbA1c at Week 24. Secondary objectives were to assess the effects of omarigliptin vs. placebo on FPG and the proportion of subjects attaining HbA1c goals of <7% and <6.5%.
RESULTS: From a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.5% (omarigliptin) and 8.6% (placebo), the least squares (LS) mean change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 24 was -0.67% in the omarigliptin group and -0.06% in the placebo group, with a between-group difference (95% CI) of -0.61% (-0.85, -0.38). Treatment with omarigliptin resulted in a significantly greater reduction in FPG relative to placebo (LS mean difference [95% CI] -0.9 mmol/L [-1.4, -0.4]; p < 0.001). The proportion of patients achieving glycemic goals of <7.0% and <6.5% was higher in the omarigliptin group relative to the placebo group. The overall incidences of adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, drug-related AEs and discontinuations were generally similar between treatment groups. The incidence of symptomatic hypoglycemia was 10.5% in the omarigliptin group and 8.5% in the placebo group. Relative to baseline, omarigliptin and placebo treatments were associated with LS mean changes in body weight of -0.1 kg and -0.9 kg, respectively.
CONCLUSION: In patients with T2D and inadequate glycemic control on dual therapy with metformin and glimepiride, compared with placebo, once-weekly omarigliptin provided greater improvement in glycemic control and was generally well tolerated.

However, they face significant barriers to accessing and affording life-saving-but expensive-antiretroviral (ARV) medications. These barriers are particularly severe for low-income patients, and they disproportionately affect racial and ethnic minorities. High ARV prices create pressure for government insurers to contain costs either by rationing care or by restricting eligibility for public programs. Limited funding, coupled with a growing demand for HIV care and treatment, is likely to make programmatic decisions about who is covered become more difficult over time. Therefore, it is important to identify options for reducing the cost of providing ARVs to allow more people to receive treatment.

In the liver, NADPH oxidase plays a central role in fibrogenesis. A functionally active form of the NADPH oxidase is expressed not only in Kupffer cells (phagocytic cell type) but also in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) (non-phagocytic cell type), suggesting a role of the non-phagocytic NADPH oxidase in HSC activation. Consistent with this concept, profibrogenic agonists such as Angiotensin II (Ang II) and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), or apoptotic bodies exert their activity through NADPH oxidase-activation in HSCs. Both pharmacological inhibition with DPI and genetic studies using p47(phox) knockout mice provided evidence for a central role of NADPH oxidase in the regulation of HSC-activity and liver fibrosis.

Some practical clarifications of multiple imputation theory.,"Multiple imputation (MI) and full information maximum likelihood (FIML) are the two most common approaches to missing data analysis. In theory, MI and FIML are equivalent when identical models are tested using the same variables, and when m, the number of imputations performed with MI, approaches infinity. However, it is important to know how many imputations are necessary before MI and FIML are sufficiently equivalent in ways that are important to prevention scientists. MI theory suggests that small values of m, even on the order of three to five imputations, yield excellent results. Previous guidelines for sufficient m are based on relative efficiency, which involves the fraction of missing information (gamma) for the parameter being estimated, and m. In the present study, we used a Monte Carlo simulation to test MI models across several scenarios in which gamma and m were varied. Standard errors and p-values for the regression coefficient of interest varied as a function of m, but not at the same rate as relative efficiency. Most importantly, statistical power for small effect sizes diminished as m became smaller, and the rate of this power falloff was much greater than predicted by changes in relative efficiency. Based our findings, we recommend that researchers using MI should perform many more imputations than previously considered sufficient. These recommendations are based on gamma, and take into consideration one's tolerance for a preventable power falloff (compared to FIML) due to using too few imputations.",2,PRIMARY,"Change in Maternal Prenatal Depression at Baseline, Midpoint, and Posttreatment (8 Weeks)","Participants were assessed with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at baseline, at 4 weeks, and at 8 weeks (posttreatment).

METHODS: In a randomised, open-label study, 121 healthy women, 18-50 years of age, were randomly assigned to receive NOMAC/E2 (2.5 mg/1.5 mg) in a 24/4-day regimen (n=60) or LNG/EE (150 μg/30 μg) in a 21/7-day regimen (n=61) for six cycles. The primary outcome was the change from baseline to cycle 6 for all indices.
RESULTS: All parameters were similar at baseline between the two groups. Over six cycles, NOMAC/E2 had less effect on most haemostatic indices than LNG/EE. Lipids were essentially unchanged with NOMAC/E2, whereas with LNG/EE high-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides slightly increased. NOMAC/E2 induced negligible changes in glucose and insulin parameters, in contrast to LNG/EE. A much smaller increase in CRP was observed with NOMAC/E2 than with LNG/EE. NOMAC/E2 was associated with a greater increase in SHBG.

We evaluated rifaximin, a minimally absorbed antibiotic, as treatment for IBS.
METHODS: In two identically designed, phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (TARGET 1 and TARGET 2), patients who had IBS without constipation were randomly assigned to either rifaximin at a dose of 550 mg or placebo, three times daily for 2 weeks, and were followed for an additional 10 weeks. The primary end point, the proportion of patients who had adequate relief of global IBS symptoms, and the key secondary end point, the proportion of patients who had adequate relief of IBS-related bloating, were assessed weekly. Adequate relief was defined as self-reported relief of symptoms for at least 2 of the first 4 weeks after treatment. Other secondary end points included the percentage of patients who had a response to treatment as assessed by daily self-ratings of global IBS symptoms and individual symptoms of bloating, abdominal pain, and stool consistency during the 4 weeks after treatment and during the entire 3 months of the study.
RESULTS: Significantly more patients in the rifaximin group than in the placebo group had adequate relief of global IBS symptoms during the first 4 weeks after treatment (40.8% vs. 31.2%, P=0.01, in TARGET 1; 40.6% vs. 32.2%, P=0.03, in TARGET 2; 40.7% vs. 31.7%, P<0.001, in the two studies combined). Similarly, more patients in the rifaximin group than in the placebo group had adequate relief of bloating (39.5% vs. 28.7%, P=0.005, in TARGET 1; 41.0% vs. 31.9%, P=0.02, in TARGET 2; 40.2% vs. 30.3%, P<0.001, in the two studies combined). In addition, significantly more patients in the rifaximin group had a response to treatment as assessed by daily ratings of IBS symptoms, bloating, abdominal pain, and stool consistency. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients who had IBS without constipation, treatment with rifaximin for 2 weeks provided significant relief of IBS symptoms, bloating, abdominal pain, and loose or watery stools.

Veverimer, a non-absorbed, counterion-free, polymeric drug, selectively binds and removes hydrochloric acid from the gastrointestinal lumen, unlike current oral sodium bicarbonate therapy for metabolic acidosis that only neutralises accumulated acid. We assessed the efficacy and safety of veverimer as a treatment for metabolic acidosis in patients with chronic kidney disease.
METHODS: We did a multicentre, parallel, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study at 37 sites (hospitals and specialty clinics) in Bulgaria, Croatia, Georgia, Hungary, Serbia, Slovenia, Ukraine, and the USA. Eligible participants were patients aged 18-85 years with non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate of 20-40 mL/min per 1·73 m
FINDINGS: Between Sept 26, 2017, and Feb 9, 2018, we randomly assigned 124 participants to veverimer and 93 to placebo. The composite primary endpoint was met by 71 (59%) of 120 patients in the veverimer group versus 20 (22%) of 89 patients in the placebo group (a difference of 37%, 95% CI 23-49; p<0·0001). The most common body system in which adverse events in the veverimer group occurred was gastrointestinal; of these, non-treatment limiting diarrhoea was the most common event (11 [9%] vs three [3%] in the veverimer and placebo groups, respectively). The most common treatment-related adverse events were gastrointestinal (diarrhoea, flatulence, nausea, and constipation) occurring in 16 (13%) patients with veverimer and five (5%) patients with placebo. Two deaths occurred during the study, both in the placebo group (unstable angina and pneumonia).
INTERPRETATION: Veverimer effectively and safely corrected metabolic acidosis. Longer-term studies are warranted to assess the effects of veverimer on physical functioning and to assess other deleterious consequences of metabolic acidosis including progression of chronic kidney disease and bone health.

Managing adult patients' pain postoperatively has been challenging due to increased chest wall rigidity and the pressure required for supporting the elevated sternum. The optimal pain management regimen has not been determined. We designed this prospective, randomized trial to compare postoperative pain management and outcomes between thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) and bilateral subcutaneous infusion pump catheters (On-Q).
METHODS: Patients undergoing MIRPE (modified Nuss) underwent random assignment to TEA or On-Q group. Both groups received intravenous, patient-controlled opioid analgesia, with concomitant delivery of local anesthetic. Primary outcomes were length of stay (LOS), opioid use, and pain scores.
RESULTS: Of 85 randomly assigned patients, 68 completed the study [52 men, 76.5%; mean (range) age, 32.2 (20.0-58.0) years; Haller index, 5.9 (range, 3.0-26.7)]. The groups were equally matched for preoperative variables; however, the On-Q arm had more patients (60.3%). No significant differences were found between groups in mean daily pain scores (P=0.52), morphine-equivalent opioid usage (P=0.28), or hospital stay 3.5 vs. 3.3 days (TEA vs. On-Q; P=0.55). Thirteen patients randomized to TEA refused the epidural and withdrew from the study because they perceived greater benefit of the On-Q system.
CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative pain management in adults after MIRPE can be difficult.

OBJECTIVES: The aims of this review were:To determine the effect of NRT compared to placebo in aiding smoking cessation, and to consider whether there is a difference in effect for the different forms of NRT (chewing gum, transdermal patches, nasal spray, inhalers and tablets/lozenges) in achieving abstinence from cigarettes. To determine whether the effect is influenced by the dosage, form and timing of use of NRT; the intensity of additional advice and support offered to the smoker; or the clinical setting in which the smoker is recruited and treated. To determine whether combinations of NRT are more likely to lead to successful quitting than one type alone. To determine whether NRT is more or less likely to lead to successful quitting compared to other pharmacotherapies.
SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register for papers with 'nicotine' or 'NRT' in the title, abstract or keywords. Date of most recent search July 2007.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized trials in which NRT was compared to placebo or to no treatment, or where different doses of NRT were compared. We excluded trials which did not report cessation rates, and those with follow up of less than six months.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data in duplicate on the type of participants, the dose, duration and form of nicotine therapy, the outcome measures, method of randomization, and completeness of follow up. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for each study. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.
MAIN RESULTS: We identified 132 trials; 111 with over 40,000 participants contributed to the primary comparison between any type of NRT and a placebo or non-NRT control group. The RR of abstinence for any form of NRT relative to control was 1.58 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.50 to 1.66). The pooled RR for each type were 1.43 (95% CI: 1.33 to 1.53, 53 trials) for nicotine gum; 1.66 (95% CI: 1.53 to 1.81, 41 trials) for nicotine patch; 1.90 (95% CI: 1.36 to 2.67, 4 trials) for nicotine inhaler; 2.00 (95% CI: 1.63 to 2.45, 6 trials) for oral tablets/lozenges; and 2.02 (95% CI: 1.49 to 3.73, 4 trials) for nicotine nasal spray. The effects were largely independent of the duration of therapy, the intensity of additional support provided or the setting in which the NRT was offered. The effect was similar in a small group of studies that aimed to assess use of NRT obtained without a prescription. In highly dependent smokers there was a significant benefit of 4 mg gum compared with 2 mg gum, but weaker evidence of a benefit from higher doses of patch. There was evidence that combining a nicotine patch with a rapid delivery form of NRT was more effective than a single type of NRT. Only one study directly compared NRT to another pharmacotherapy. In this study quit rates with nicotine patch were lower than with the antidepressant bupropion.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: All of the commercially available forms of NRT (gum, transdermal patch, nasal spray, inhaler and sublingual tablets/lozenges) can help people who make a quit attempt to increase their chances of successfully stopping smoking. NRTs increase the rate of quitting by 50-70%, regardless of setting. The effectiveness of NRT appears to be largely independent of the intensity of additional support provided to the individual.

We have investigated the incidence of chronic renal failure and its risk factors in our transplant population, which was treated predominantly with cyclosporine.
METHODS: A single-center retrospective study was done of 883 consecutive adult patients receiving a first liver transplant between 1982 and 1996. Potential risk factors for the development of chronic renal failure were recorded, including serial measurements of cyclosporine therapy and renal function.
RESULTS: Severe chronic renal failure (serum creatinine level >250 microM/L for at least 6 months) developed in 25 patients, representing 4% of patients surviving 1 year or more. Twelve of these patients developed end-stage renal failure and mortality was 44%. The predominant cause of renal failure was cyclosporine nephrotoxicity. Serum creatinine as early as 3 months after surgery was strongly associated with the eventual development of severe chronic renal failure (P=0.001), and this group could be further subdivided into two groups with differing risk factors. The first group had early (<1 year) renal dysfunction, with older age (P=0.03), cytomegalovirus infection (P=0.03), need for perioperative renal replacement therapy (P=0.06), and regrafting (P=0.06) as risk factors for eventual renal failure; the second group had late-onset (>1 year) renal dysfunction, with cyclosporine levels at 1 month after surgery (P=0.007) and daily and cumulative cyclosporine dosage at 5 years (P=0.01 for both) as risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: With improved survival of liver transplant recipients, chronic renal failure has become an important cause of morbidity and is associated with a high mortality.

There are two types of CSW, direct CSW (DCSW) and indirect CSW (IDCSW), who are different from each other in sexual activities. This study was conducted in order to describe the risk factors on HIV for each type of CSW, and to establish effective preventive strategies against the HIV epidemic among CSW.
METHODS: The participants, 143 DCSW and 94 IDCSW, were interviewed using a questionnaire to determine their demographic characteristics and behaviour. Blood samples were taken for serological tests on HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis and syphilis. The association between their behavioural pattern and their serological results was analysed.
RESULTS: The questionnaire study showed that IDCSW had a riskier behavioural pattern than DCSW. The HIV seroprevalence rates of the DCSW and the IDCSW were 52.4% and 22.3%, respectively. Univariate logistic analyses showed a significant association between HIV antibody (HIV-Ab) and current age, age at commencement of commercial sex work, duration of commercial sex work, and the seropositivity of Chlamydia trachomatis-IgG antibody (CT-IgG-Ab) among the DCSW. The analyses also showed a significant relationship between HIV-Ab and CT-IgG-Ab among the IDCSW.
CONCLUSIONS: Improving condom use rate is very important in order to prevent an HIV epidemic among the two types of CSW.

However, there have been no evidence-based interventions targeting substance-using YGBM. This study was designed to test a brief motivational interviewing (MI) intervention to reduce both risky sex and drug use among HIV-negative YGBM.
METHOD: A total of 143 non-treatment-seeking YGBM (ages 18-29 years) who reported recent unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) and recreational drug use were randomized to 4 sessions of MI or 4 sessions of content-matched education. Participants were followed every 3 months for 1 year, and behavior change was examined across conditions and time for aggregated and day-level drug use and UAI.
RESULTS: Regardless of condition, participants reported significant reductions in UAI and substance use over time. However, YGBM in the MI condition were 18% less likely to use drugs and 24% less likely to engage in UAI than YGBM in the education condition.
CONCLUSIONS: The results support the utility of MI, compared with a content-matched education condition, to significantly reduce both UAI and drug use among YGBM. Interventions may benefit from an emphasis on substance use reductions, which might indirectly lead to less frequent UAI.

We evaluated mipomersen, an apolipoprotein B synthesis inhibitor, to further lower LDL-C in HeFH patients with coronary artery disease.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial randomized patients with HeFH and coronary artery disease on maximally tolerated statin and LDL-C ≥2.6 mmol/L (≥100 mg/dL) to weekly subcutaneous mipomersen 200 mg or placebo (2:1) for 26 weeks. The primary end point was percent change in LDL-C from baseline at week 28. Safety assessments included adverse events, laboratory tests, and magnetic resonance imaging assessment of hepatic fat. Of 124 randomized patients (41 placebo, 83 mipomersen), 114 (41 placebo, 73 mipomersen) completed treatment. Mean (95% confidence interval) LDL-C decreased significantly with mipomersen (-28.0% [-34.0% to -22.1%] compared with 5.2% [-0.5% to 10.9%] increase with placebo; P<0.001). Mipomersen significantly reduced apolipoprotein B (-26.3%), total cholesterol (-19.4%), and lipoprotein(a) (-21.1%) compared with placebo (all P<0.001). No significant change occurred in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Adverse events included injection site reactions and influenza-like symptoms. Five mipomersen patients (6%) had 2 consecutive alanine aminotransferase values ≥3 times the upper limit of normal at least 7 days apart; none were associated with significant bilirubin increases. Hepatic fat content increased a median of 4.9% with mipomersen versus 0.4% with placebo (P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Mipomersen is an effective therapy to further reduce apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins, including LDL and lipoprotein(a), in HeFH patients with coronary artery disease on statins and other lipid-lowering therapy. The significance of hepatic fat and transaminase increases remains uncertain at this time.

Currently licensed pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) confer protection against PD caused by most vaccine serotypes, but non-vaccine serotypes contribute to residual disease. V114 is a 15-valent PCV containing all 13 serotypes in Prevnar 13™ (PCV13) and additional serotypes 22F and 33F. This pivotal phase 3 study compared safety and immunogenicity of V114 and PCV13.
METHODS: 1720 healthy infants were randomized 1:1 to receive a 4-dose regimen of V114 or PCV13 concomitantly with other routine pediatric vaccines. Safety was evaluated after each dose as proportion of participants with adverse events (AEs). Serotype-specific anti-pneumococcal immunoglobulin G (IgG) was measured at 1-month post-dose 3 (PD3), pre-dose 4, and 1-month post-dose 4 (PD4). IgG response rates, geometric mean concentrations (GMCs), and opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) were compared between vaccination groups.
RESULTS: The proportion, maximum intensity, and duration of injection-site, systemic, and serious AEs were generally comparable between V114 and PCV13 groups. In comparison to PCV13, V114 met non-inferiority criteria for all 15 serotypes based on IgG response rates at PD3. V114 met non-inferiority criteria by IgG GMCs for all serotypes at PD3 and PD4, except for serotype 6A at PD3. V114-induced antibodies had bactericidal activity as assessed by OPA. Further, V114 met superiority criteria for shared serotype 3 and unique serotypes 22F and 33F compared to PCV13 by serotype-specific IgG GMCs at both PD3 and PD4. Immunogenicity of concomitantly administered routine pediatric vaccines was comparable in V114 and PCV13 groups.
CONCLUSIONS: In healthy infants, V114 displays acceptable safety and tolerability profiles and generates comparable immune responses to PCV13. V114 also met superiority criteria for serotypes 3, 22F, and 33F. These results support use of V114 for prevention of PD as part of routine infant vaccination schedules.

METHODS: In a randomised, open-label study, 121 healthy women, 18-50 years of age, were randomly assigned to receive NOMAC/E2 (2.5 mg/1.5 mg) in a 24/4-day regimen (n=60) or LNG/EE (150 μg/30 μg) in a 21/7-day regimen (n=61) for six cycles. The primary outcome was the change from baseline to cycle 6 for all indices.
RESULTS: All parameters were similar at baseline between the two groups. Over six cycles, NOMAC/E2 had less effect on most haemostatic indices than LNG/EE. Lipids were essentially unchanged with NOMAC/E2, whereas with LNG/EE high-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides slightly increased. NOMAC/E2 induced negligible changes in glucose and insulin parameters, in contrast to LNG/EE. A much smaller increase in CRP was observed with NOMAC/E2 than with LNG/EE.

METHOD: Participants were 105 males and females who were 18 years of age and older and in a pretrial jail diversion program. The sample was approximately 52% Black and other minorities and 48% White. Outcome variables at a 6-month follow-up were frequency of substance use (assessed with the Timeline Follow-back Interview and objective toxicology screens), substance use consequences (Short Inventory of Problems-Alcohol and Drug version), and self-reported participation in nonstudy mental health and/or substance use treatment. Psychopathy was assessed using the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R).
RESULTS: BMI interacted with core psychopathic traits to account for 7% of the variance in substance use at follow-up. Treatment was associated with greater use among individuals with high levels of core psychopathic traits. Toxicology screening results were consistent with self-report data. The treatment and standard care groups did not differ on substance use consequences or nonstudy treatment participation at follow-up, and no moderation was found with these outcomes. An exploratory analysis indicated that low levels of affective traits of psychopathy were associated with benefit from the BMI in terms of decreased substance use.

METHODS: Adult patients undergoing abdominal surgery received rocuronium, followed by randomized allocation to sugammadex (2 or 4 mg kg(-1)) or usual care (neostigmine/glycopyrrolate, dosing per usual care practice) for reversal of neuromuscular blockade. Timing of reversal agent administration was based on the providers' clinical judgement. Primary endpoint was the presence of residual neuromuscular blockade at PACU admission, defined as a train-of-four (TOF) ratio <0.9, using TOF-Watch® SX. Key secondary endpoint was time between reversal agent administration and operating room discharge-readiness; analysed with analysis of covariance.
RESULTS: Of 154 patients randomized, 150 had a TOF value measured at PACU entry.

The present multicenter double-blind randomized parallel-group study examined the efficacy and safety of a sitagliptin and metformin fixed-dose combination (Sita/Met) compared with glimepiride in T2D patients as initial treatment.
METHODS: Type 2 diabetes patients (aged ≥18 years) were randomized to Sita/Met or glimepiride for 30 weeks after a wash-off run-in period. The primary endpoint was change from baseline (CFB) in HbA1c. Secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients achieving target goal (HbA1c < 7.0 % [53 mmol/mol]) and CFB in fasting plasma glucose (FPG). Safety assessments comprised weight gain from baseline and the incidence of adverse events (AEs).
RESULTS: In total, 292 patients were randomized to Sita/Met (n = 147) or glimepiride (n = 145).

Peri-implant and/or gingival samples from loosened implants, chronic periodontitis (CP), and normal controls (n = 10 samples in each group) were analyzed using immunohistochemical staining to observe tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 1-alpha (IL-1alpha), IL-6, platelet-derived growth factor A (PDGF-A), and transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha). These cytokines were found in foreign-body giant cells, macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells. TNF-alpha, IL-1alpha, and IL-6 were increased (P < .05; unpaired t test) in peri-implantitis and CP, whereas PDGF-A and TGF-alpha were not. In conclusion, cytokines with a potential to activate osteoclasts were found in both peri-implantitis and CP, but the cytokine profiles differed in that IL-1alpha was the most prevalent cytokine in the former and TNF-alpha was the most common in the latter.

This study investigated whether cigarette demand predicted response to contingent monetary rewards for abstinence among individuals with substance use disorders. It also sought to replicate evidence for greater price sensitivity at whole-dollar pack price transitions (ie, left-digit effects).
METHODS: Participants (N = 338) were individuals in residential substance use disorder treatment who participated in a randomized controlled trial that compared contingent vouchers to noncontingent vouchers for smoking abstinence. Baseline demand indices were used to predict number of abstinent days during the 14-day voucher period (after the reduction lead-in) and at 1 and 3 months afterward.
RESULTS: Demand indices correlated with measures of smoking and nicotine dependence. As measured by elasticity, intensity and O max, higher demand significantly predicted fewer abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings during voucher period for individuals in the noncontingent vouchers condition. Breakpoint exhibited a trend-level association with abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings. Demand indices did not predict abstinence in the contingent vouchers group, and did not predict abstinence at 1- and 3-month follow-ups. Left-digit price transitions were associated with significantly greater reductions in consumption.
CONCLUSIONS: The association of cigarette demand with smoking behavior only in the group for whom abstinence was not incentivized indicates that CPT assesses the value of smoking more than the value of money per se and that vouchers counteract the effects of the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes. Results provide initial short-term evidence of predictive validity for the CPT indices.
IMPLICATIONS: This study provides the first evidence of the validity of the CPT for predicting early response to brief advice for smoking cessation plus nicotine replacement in smokers with substance dependence. However, demand for cigarettes did not predict voucher-based treatment response, indicating that incentives serve as a powerful motivator not to smoke that acts in opposition to the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes and that the indices reflect the value of smoking more than the value of money per se.",0,PRIMARY,Number of Participants Smoking Abstinent in Past 7 Days,7 -day smoking cessation confirmed by expired alveolar CO levels of \< 10 ppm or salivary cotinine \< 16 ng/ml.,Contingency Management (CM),Noncontingent Reinforcement (NR),"Condition provides contingent monetary reinforcement for smoking reductions (first 5 days) then for smoking abstinence (subsequent 14 days).

In the cART era, the life expectancy of HIV-infected (HIV+) individuals has increased. More HIV + individuals are aging with current projections suggesting that 50% of HIV + individuals will be over 50 years old by 2015. With advancing age, HIV + individuals may be at increased risk of developing other potential neurodegenerative disorders [especially Alzheimer's disease (AD)]. Pathology studies have shown that HIV increases intra and possibly extracellular amyloid beta (Aβ42), a hallmark of AD. We review the synthesis and clearance of Aβ42; the effects of HIV on the amyloid pathway; and contrast the impact of AD and HIV on Aβ42 metabolism. Biomarker studies (cerebrospinal fluid AB and amyloid imaging) in HIV + participants have shown mixed results. CSF Aβ42 has been shown to be either normal or diminished in with HIV associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Amyloid imaging using [(11)C] PiB has also not demonstrated increased extracellular amyloid fibrillar deposits in HAND. We further demonstrate that Aβ42 deposition is not increased in older HIV + participants using [(11)C] PiB amyloid imaging. Together, these results suggest that HIV and aging each independently affect Aβ42 deposition with no significant interaction present. Older HIV + individuals are probably not at increased risk for developing AD. However, future longitudinal studies of older HIV + individuals using multiple modalities (including the combination of CSF markers and amyloid imaging) are necessary for investigating the effects of HIV on Aβ42 metabolism.",2,PRIMARY,"Change in Global Cognition From Baseline to Follow up, in Exercise Group vs. Stretching Group",This measure examines the global z-score which is an average of all the individual cognitive test z scores.

Sessions will be offered weekdays. Sessions will start with range of motion exercises. Participants will follow an individualized EXS training prescription based on baseline cardio testing. Individual aerobic EXS intensity is based on % of maximum HR achieved during the baseline cardiorespiratory fitness test. The target EXS HR will start at 50% and progress to 85% HR reserve. During aerobic EXS, HR will be monitored by a battery-operated HR monitor. EXS intensity \& duration will be increased as the participant acclimates to the EXS prescription. Adaptation is determined when a given EXS intensity yields a lower HR than prior sessions conducted at the same intensity.

Exercise: The resistance EXS training component will follow aerobic EXS \& will consist of 4 upper and 3 lower body routines. A combination of guided-motion machines and free weights will be used. Voluntary maximum strength will be measured during the first 4 sessions on each EXS station. The program will initially consist of 1-2 sets of each EXS while lifting a weight that causes muscle fatigue after 8-10 repetitions. The trainer will monitor each participant's EXS response, and when the participant can comfortably lift the weight for 12 repetitions on any EXS, the weight will be increased to cause the muscle group to fatigue after 8 repetitions. This progressive 8-12 repetition cycle is repeated for each EXS over 26 weeks.","This group will serve as a control group against which to gauge the effects of aerobic and resistance training on cognitive function.

The sample included adult RTRs who were at least 1 year posttransplant, taking tacrolimus or cyclosporine and served by a specialty pharmacy. Pharmacy refill records were used to measure adherence and monthly questionnaires were used to measure healthcare utilizations. Direct medical costs were estimated using the 2009 Medicare Expenditure Panel Survey. Adherence was analyzed using the GLM procedure and the MIXED procedure of SAS. Rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated to quantify the rate of utilizing healthcare services relative to treatment assignment. One hundred fifty RTRs were enrolled in the study. Intervention group RTRs (n = 76) had higher adherence than control group RTRs (n = 74) over the study period (p < 0.01).

Behavioral correlates of depression, such as satisfaction with leisure activities (i.e., leisure satisfaction), may also be associated with endothelial function via their association with depressive symptoms. This study examined the longitudinal associations between stress, depressive symptoms, leisure satisfaction, and endothelial function as measured by FMD.
METHOD: Participants were 116 older Alzheimer's caregivers (M age = 74.3 ± 8.1; 68% women; 87% white) who underwent 3 yearly assessments of FMD, stress, depressive symptoms, and leisure satisfaction. Mixed-regression analyses were used to examine longitudinal relationships between constructs of interest.
RESULTS: A significant and positive association was found between leisure satisfaction and FMD (p = .050), whereas a negative relationship was found for stress (p = .017). Depressive symptoms were not associated with FMD (p = .432). Time (p < .001) and the number of years caregiving (p = .027) were also significant predictors of FMD, suggesting that FMD decreased over time and was worse the longer a participant had been a caregiver prior to study enrollment.

HIV-infected individuals not receiving antiretroviral therapy were randomized to receive either 8 weeks of atorvastatin (80 mg) or placebo daily. After a 4-6 week washout phase, participants switched treatment assignments. The study had 80% power to detect a 0.3 log(10) decrease in HIV-1 RNA level. Expression of CD38 and HLA-DR on CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells was used to measure immune activation.
RESULTS: Of 24 randomized participants, 22 completed the study. Although HIV-1 RNA level was unaffected by the intervention (-0.13 log(10) copies/mL; P = .85), atorvastatin use resulted in reductions in circulating proportions of CD4(+) HLA-DR(+) (-2.5%; P = .02), CD8(+) HLA-DR(+) (-5%; P = .006), and CD8(+) HLA-DR(+) CD38(+) T cells (-3%; P = .03). Reductions in immune activation did not correlate with declines in serum levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

We assessed the effects of early administration of a short course of tranexamic acid on death, vascular occlusive events, and the receipt of blood transfusion in trauma patients.
METHODS: This randomised controlled trial was undertaken in 274 hospitals in 40 countries. 20 211 adult trauma patients with, or at risk of, significant bleeding were randomly assigned within 8 h of injury to either tranexamic acid (loading dose 1 g over 10 min then infusion of 1 g over 8 h) or matching placebo. Randomisation was balanced by centre, with an allocation sequence based on a block size of eight, generated with a computer random number generator. Both participants and study staff (site investigators and trial coordinating centre staff) were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was death in hospital within 4 weeks of injury, and was described with the following categories: bleeding, vascular occlusion (myocardial infarction, stroke and pulmonary embolism), multiorgan failure, head injury, and other. All analyses were by intention to treat. This study is registered as ISRCTN86750102, Clinicaltrials.govNCT00375258, and South African Clinical Trial RegisterDOH-27-0607-1919.
FINDINGS: 10 096 patients were allocated to tranexamic acid and 10 115 to placebo, of whom 10 060 and 10 067, respectively, were analysed. All-cause mortality was significantly reduced with tranexamic acid (1463 [14.5%] tranexamic acid group vs 1613 [16.0%] placebo group; relative risk 0.91, 95% CI 0.85-0.97; p=0.0035). The risk of death due to bleeding was significantly reduced (489 [4.9%] vs 574 [5.7%]; relative risk 0.85, 95% CI 0.76-0.96; p=0.0077).
INTERPRETATION: Tranexamic acid safely reduced the risk of death in bleeding trauma patients in this study. On the basis of these results, tranexamic acid should be considered for use in bleeding trauma patients.

AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vardenafil vs. placebo in men who had ED and metabolic syndrome.
METHODS: This was a 12-week, double-blind, randomized, multicenter, parallel-group, placebo-controlled prospective study in men with ED and metabolic syndrome (assessed by the International Diabetes Federation criteria). Vardenafil was administered at a starting dose of 10 mg, which could be titrated to 5 mg or 20 mg after 4 weeks, depending on efficacy and tolerability.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary efficacy measures were the erectile function domain of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-EF) and Sexual Encounter Profile (SEP) diary questions 2/3. Secondary efficacy measures included SEP1, a diary question assessing ejaculation, the percentage of men achieving ""return-to-normal"" erectile function, and the percentage of men who titrated to a different dose. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded throughout the study.
RESULTS: The intent-to-treat population included 145 men (vardenafil, N = 75; placebo, N = 70). Baseline least squares IIEF-EF domain scores were low (vardenafil: 12.0; placebo: 12.7), indicative of moderate-to-severe ED. Vardenafil was statistically significantly superior to placebo for all primary efficacy measures (P < 0.0001) and showed nominally statistically significant superiority compared with placebo for SEP1/ejaculation success rates (P = 0.0003 and P < 0.0001, respectively) and the percentage of subjects reporting ""return-to-normal"" erectile function (P = 0.0004). Treatment-emergent AEs were mild-to-moderate in severity and consistent with the known AE profile of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to assess the efficacy and safety of vardenafil, taken alone, for ED therapy in a population of men who all had metabolic syndrome.

METHODS: Eligible patients are adults enrolled in Veterans Affairs (VA) health care who have not experienced a cardiovascular event but are at elevated risk based on their Framingham Risk Score (FRS). Participants in this two-site study are randomized to either the intervention or care as usual, with a target of 400 participants. The study intervention, Healthy Living Problem-Solving (HELPS), consists of six group sessions conducted approximately monthly interspersed with individualized coaching calls to help participants apply problem-solving principles.

Here, we sought to determine whether there are clinical phenotypes that are associated with a suboptimal pharmacological effect of aspirin. In a prospective, 2-week study, we evaluated the effect of aspirin (81 mg) on platelet COX-1 in 135 patients with stable coronary artery disease by measuring serum thromboxane B(2) (sTxB(2)) as an indicator of inhibition of platelet COX-1. A nested randomized study compared enteric-coated with immediate-release formulations of aspirin. We found that sTxB(2) was systematically higher among the 83 patients with metabolic syndrome than among the 52 patients without (median: 4.0 versus 3.02 ng/mL; P=0.013). Twelve patients (14%) with metabolic syndrome, but none without metabolic syndrome, had sTxB(2) levels consistent with inadequate inhibition of COX (sTxB(2) ≥13 ng/mL). In linear regression models, metabolic syndrome (but none of its individual components) significantly associated with higher levels of log-transformed sTxB(2) (P=0.006).

METHODS: Patients were randomised to degarelix 240/80 mg or goserelin 3.6 mg + bicalutamide flare protection (G+B); both treatments were administered for 3 months. The primary endpoint was change in International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) at week 12 compared with baseline.
RESULTS: This study was stopped early due to recruitment difficulties. 40 patients received treatment (degarelix n = 27; G+B n = 13); most had locally advanced disease and were highly symptomatic. Degarelix was non-inferior to G+B in reducing IPSS at week 12 in the full analysis set (p = 0.20); the significantly larger IPSS reduction in the per-protocol analysis (p = 0.04) was suggestive of superior reductions with degarelix. Significantly more degarelix patients had improved quality of life (IPSS question) at week 12 (85 vs. 46%; p = 0.01). Mean prostate size reductions at week 12 were 42 versus 25% for patients receiving degarelix versus G+B, respectively (p = 0.04; post hoc analysis). Most adverse events were mild/moderate; more degarelix patients experienced injection site reactions whereas more G+B patients had urinary tract infections/cystitis.

Black populations may be disproportionately affected by LABA risks.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness and safety of tiotropium vs LABAs, when used with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in black adults with asthma and to determine whether allelic variation at the Arg16Gly locus of the β2-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) geneis associated with treatment response.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A multisite (n = 20), open-label, parallel-group, pragmatic randomized clinical trial conducted from March 2011 through July 2013, enrolling black adults with moderate to severe asthma in the United States.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients eligible for, or receiving, step 3 or step 4 combination therapy per National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute guidelines, received ICS plus either once-daily tiotropium (n = 532) or twice-daily LABAs (n = 538,) and were followed up for up to 18 months. Patients underwent genotyping, attended study visits at baseline, 1, 6, 12, and 18 months, and completed monthly questionnaires.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was time to asthma exacerbation, defined as a worsening asthma event requiring oral or parenteral corticosteroids. Secondary outcomes included patient-reported outcomes (Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire, Asthma Control Questionnaire [ACQ], Asthma Symptom Utility Index, and Asthma Symptom-Free Days questionnaire), spirometry (FEV1), rescue medication use, asthma deteriorations, and adverse events.
RESULTS: There was no difference between LABA + ICS vs tiotropium + ICS in time to first exacerbation (mean No. of exacerbations/person-year, 0.42 vs 0.37 (rate ratio, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.73 to 1.11], log-rank P = .31). There was no difference in change in FEV1 at 12 months (0.003 L for LABA + ICS vs -0.018 L for tiotropium + ICS; between-group difference, 0.020 [95% CI, -0.021 to 0.061], P = .33) and at 18 months (-0.053 L vs -0.078 L; between-group difference, 0.025 [95% CI, -0.045 to 0.095], P = .49). There were no differences in ACQ score at 18 months (change in score from baseline, -0.68 for LABA + ICS vs -0.72 for tiotropium + ICS; between-group difference, 0.04 [95% CI, -0.18 to 0.27], P = .70). There were no differences in other patient-reported outcomes. Arg16Gly ADRB2 alleles were not associated with differences in the effects of tiotropium + ICS vs LABA + ICS (hazard ratio for time to first exacerbation, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.47 to 1.51] for Arg/Arg vs 0.85 [95% CI, 0.63 to 1.15] for Arg/Gly or Gly/Gly, P = .97).
CONCLUSIONS/RELEVANCE: Among black adults with asthma treated with ICS, adding a LABA did not improve time to asthma exacerbation compared with adding tiotropium. These findings were not affected by polymorphisms at the Arg16Gly locus of ADRB2. These findings do not support the superiority of LABA + ICS compared with tiotropium + ICS for black patients with asthma.

METHODS AND RESULTS: COMBO II is a double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, parallel-group, 104-week study of alirocumab vs. ezetimibe. Patients (n = 720) with high cardiovascular risk and elevated LDL-C despite maximal doses of statins were enrolled (August 2012-May 2013). This pre-specified analysis was conducted after the last patient completed 52 weeks. Patients were randomized to subcutaneous alirocumab 75 mg every 2 weeks (plus oral placebo) or oral ezetimibe 10 mg daily (plus subcutaneous placebo) on a background of statin therapy. At Week 24, mean ± SE reductions in LDL-C from baseline were 50.6 ± 1.4% for alirocumab vs. 20.7 ± 1.9% for ezetimibe (difference 29.8 ± 2.3%; P < 0.0001); 77.0% of alirocumab and 45.6% of ezetimibe patients achieved LDL-C <1.8 mmol/L (P < 0.0001). Mean achieved LDL-C at Week 24 was 1.3 ± 0.04 mmol/L with alirocumab and 2.1 ± 0.05 mmol/L with ezetimibe, and were maintained to Week 52. Alirocumab was generally well tolerated, with no evidence of an excess of treatment-emergent adverse events.

METHODS: The cross-sectional study was conducted at Ege University Medical School, Izmir, Turkey, between May 2010 and April 2011. The patients were divided into four equal groups: Group 1--snoring without apnoea (age 20-40); Group 2--snoring without apnoea (age 40-60); Group 3--apnoea-hypopnoea index < 5/hr; Group 4: apnoea-hypopnoea index > 30/hr. Calibrated oropharynx pictures were taken. Distance between palatoglossal and palatopharyngeal arches, height of palatoglossal and palatopharyngeal arches, uvula width, uvula length and distance between tonsils were measured. SPSS 17 was used for statistical analysis.
RESULTS: Of the 80 patients in the study, 44 (55%) were men. Mean distance between palatopharyngeal and palatoglossal arches were 1.55 ± 0.34 cm and 2.70 ± 0.43 cm respectively. Mean height of palatopharyngeal and palatoglossal arches were 0.60 ± 0.21 cm and 1.37 ± 0.36 cm respectively (p > 0.05).

METHODS: We performed a double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled, crossover trial with cerebello-spinal tDCS (5 d/wk for 2 weeks) in 20 patients with neurodegenerative ataxia. Each patient underwent a clinical evaluation before and after real tDCS or sham stimulation. A follow-up evaluation was performed at 1 and 3 months with a crossover washout period of 3 months. Cerebello-motor connectivity was evaluated with transcranial magnetic stimulation at baseline and at each follow-up.
RESULTS: Cerebello-spinal tDCS showed a significant improvement in all performance scores (Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia, International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale, 9-Hole Peg Test, 8-m walking time), in motor cortex excitability, and in cerebellar brain inhibition compared to sham stimulation.
CONCLUSIONS: A 2-week treatment with cerebello-spinal tDCS reduces symptoms in patients with ataxia and restores motor cortex inhibition exerted by cerebellar structures.

However, accumulating evidence suggests that these agents, particularly clozapine and olanzapine, have serious side effects of their own, including weight gain and elevated glucose and triglyceride levels. The goal of this study is to compare the effects of novel antipsychotics clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, and quetiapine and typical antipsychotics haloperidol and fluphenazine on glucose and lipid levels.
METHOD: The charts of 590 patients were retrospectively reviewed. Of those, 215 patients had adequate laboratory data for inclusion. Glucose and lipid level data from 2 1/2 years before and after initiation of the target antipsychotic were included. Covariates, including patients' age, the duration of antipsychotic treatment, other medications that may affect glucose or lipid levels, and the initial laboratory values, were controlled for in the analyses.
RESULTS: Glucose levels were increased from baseline for patients treated with clozapine, olanzapine, and haloperidol. There were statistically and clinically significant differences among the medications' effects on lipid profiles (p < .05). Those receiving clozapine and olanzapine demonstrated statistically significant increases in triglyceride levels compared with the other groups. Over one third of patients treated with any of the novel antipsychotics had clinically meaningful triglyceride elevations.
CONCLUSION: It has been shown that novel antipsychotics are associated with weight gain. This risk factor along with others, such as elevated glucose and triglyceride levels, compounds the risk for coronary artery disease.

We evaluated the effect of 0.15 and 0.5 mg kg(-1) DEX on the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and on pain intensity after paediatric tonsillectomy.
METHODS: A total of 147 children aged 2-8 yr undergoing elective tonsillectomy were included in this prospective randomized double-blind study. At the induction of anaesthesia, subjects received 0.15 mg kg(-1) (DEX 0.15), 0.5 mg kg(-1) (DEX 0.5) DEX, or an equivalent volume of saline solution (placebo).

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II trial enrolled 178 patients with cirrhosis, including 59 already taking rifaximin, who had experienced two or more hepatic encephalopathy (HE) events in the previous 6 months. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with HE events. Other endpoints included the time to first event, total number of events, HE hospitalizations, symptomatic days, and safety. GPB, at 6 mL orally twice-daily, significantly reduced the proportion of patients who experienced an HE event (21% versus 36%; P=0.02), time to first event (hazard ratio [HR]=0.56; P<0.05), as well as total events (35 versus 57; P=0.04), and was associated with fewer HE hospitalizations (13 versus 25; P=0.06). Among patients not on rifaximin at enrollment, GPB reduced the proportion of patients with an HE event (10% versus 32%; P<0.01), time to first event (HR=0.29; P<0.01), and total events (7 versus 31; P<0.01). Plasma ammonia was significantly lower in patients on GPB and correlated with HE events when measured either at baseline or during the study. A similar proportion of patients in the GPB (79%) and placebo groups (76%) experienced adverse events.
CONCLUSION: GPB reduced HE events as well as ammonia in patients with cirrhosis and HE and its safety profile was similar to placebo.

METHODS: A phase IIIb, open-label, 1:1 randomized, active-controlled, 24-week multicentre study of T2DM patients inadequately controlled on metformin was conducted. Patients were administered lixisenatide before breakfast or the main meal. The primary endpoint was change from baseline at week 24 in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). Other endpoints: changes in body weight, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 7-point self-monitored plasma glucose (SMPG) and Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire status (DTSQs) score. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored.
RESULTS: Mean change in HbA1c from baseline at week 24 was -0.65% (-7.1mmol/mol; main meal) and -0.74% (-8.1mmol/mol; breakfast). Mean changes in FPG, body weight and DTSQs score were comparable between groups. The mean change in body weight (kg) was -2.60 (main meal) and -2.80 (breakfast group). The 7-point SMPG profiles showed greatest reductions in postprandial glucose after the meal at which lixisenatide was administered, with a residual effect seen on the subsequent meal.

Chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid are antioxidants in vitro and might therefore contribute to the prevention of cardiovascular disease. However, data on the absorption of chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid in humans are lacking. We determined the absorption of chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid in a cross-over study with 4 female and 3 male healthy ileostomy subjects. In such subjects, degradation by the colonic microflora is minimal and absorption can be calculated as the amount ingested minus the amount excreted in ileostomy effluent. The ileostomy subjects ingested 2.8 mmol chlorogenic acid and 2.8 mmol caffeic acid on separate days in random order and subsequently collected ileostomy fluid and urine for 24 h. Absorption of chlorogenic acid was 33 +/- 17% (mean +/- SD) and of caffeic acid 95 +/- 4%. Traces of the ingested chlorogenic acid and 11% of the ingested caffeic acid were excreted in urine. Thus, one third of chlorogenic acid and almost all of the caffeic acid were absorbed in the small intestine of humans.

AD is multi-dimensional in nature, characterized not only by cognitive and functional decline but by neuropsychiatric symptoms that develop commonly and are associated with considerable morbidity. There have been a large number of empirical trials of various pharmacological agents to reduce these symptoms, such as agitation. Although antipsychotics are used most frequently for agitation, the usual effect size is modest, and there is a range of tolerability and/or safety issues, leading to the hope that alternatives can be found. Furthermore, most clinical trials addressing psychopathology have not been mechanism-based and none have attempted an alternative approach, namely, to delay or prevent the emergence of psychopathology.
FINDINGS: The evidence of clinical trials is reviewed regarding the safety, tolerability, and apparent efficacy of the mood stabilizers carbamazepine and valproate for agitation associated with AD. Possible mechanisms of action of valproate are reviewed, leading to the surprising conclusion that neuroprotective properties may account for some of its clinical effects. These mechanisms (including activation of wnt-dependent signaling and upregulation of bcl-2, among others) may be particularly relevant for long-term treatment of AD.
CONCLUSIONS: These clinical and mechanistic findings were combined in the development of a novel clinical trial examining whether chronic valproate therapy can attenuate the clinical progression of AD, which will be implemented by the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study. The design addresses valproate's potential to delay or prevent the onset of agitation in patients lacking agitation to begin with, as well as to slow progressive decline in cognition and daily functioning.",2,PRIMARY,Presence of Agitation and/or Psychosis Measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Combined With an Assessment of the Clinical Significance of Behavioral Change Rated by the Study Clinician,"NPI quantifies behavioral changes in dementia, including depression, anxiety, psychosis, agitation, and others.

An injectable suspension of naltrexone for extended release (XR-NTX) was recently approved by the FDA for treatment of opioid dependence. XR-NTX treatment may require concurrent behavioral intervention to maximize adherence and effectiveness, thus we sought to evaluate employment-based reinforcement as a method of improving adherence to XR-NTX in opiate dependent adults.
METHODS: Opioid-dependent adults (n=38) were detoxified and inducted onto oral naltrexone, then randomly assigned to contingency or prescription conditions. Participants received up to six doses of XR-NTX at four-week intervals. All participants could earn vouchers for attendance and performance at a therapeutic workplace. Contingency participants were required to accept XR-NTX injections to access the workplace and earn vouchers. Prescription participants could earn vouchers independent of their acceptance of XR-NTX injections.
RESULTS: Contingency participants accepted significantly more naltrexone injections than prescription participants (87% versus 52%, p=.002), and were more likely to accept all injections (74% versus 26%, p=.004). Participants in the two conditions provided similar percentages of samples negative for opiates (72% versus 65%) and for cocaine (58% versus 54%). Opiate positivity was significantly more likely when samples were also cocaine positive, independent of naltrexone blockade (p=.002).

This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
METHODS: Adult patients with T2DM and CHD (N = 93) on a stable dose of simvastatin 20 mg with LDL-C >or= 2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) and <or= 4.1 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) were randomized to ezetimibe 10 mg plus simvastatin 20 mg (EZ + simva 10/20 mg) or simvastatin 40 mg for 6 weeks. Percent change in LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides was assessed.
RESULTS: EZ + simva 10/20 mg produced a significantly greater change from treated baseline compared with simvastatin 40 mg in LDL-C (-32.2% vs -20.8%; p < 0.01) and total cholesterol (-20.6% vs -13.2%; p < 0.01).

OBJECTIVE: This study compared the sociodemographic, clinical, and health care utilization characteristics of a multisite sample of HIV-positive persons who were hard to reach with a nationally representative cohort of persons with HIV infection who were receiving care from known HIV providers in the United States and examined whether the independent correlates of low ambulatory utilization differed between the 2 samples.
METHODS: We compared sociodemographic, clinical, and health care utilization characteristics in 2 samples of adults with HIV infection: 1286 persons from 16 sites across the United States interviewed in 2001-2002 for the Targeted HIV Outreach and Intervention Initiative (Outreach), a study of underserved persons targeted for supportive outreach services; and 2267 persons from the HIV Costs and Services Utilization Study (HCSUS), a probability sample of persons receiving care who were interviewed in 1998. We conducted logistic regression analyses to identify differences between the 2 samples in sociodemographic and clinical associations with ambulatory medical visits.
RESULTS: Compared with the HCSUS sample, the Outreach sample had notably greater proportions of black respondents (59% vs. 32%, P = 0.0001), Hispanics (20% vs. 16%), Spanish-speakers (9% vs. 2%, P = 0.02), those with low socioeconomic status (annual income < Dollars 10,000 75% vs. 45%, P = 0.0001), the unemployed, and persons with homelessness, no insurance, and heroin or cocaine use (58% vs. 47%, P = 0.05).

Nearly all these differences persisted after stratifying for level of ambulatory utilization (fewer than 2 vs. 2 or more in the last 6 months). In multivariate analysis, several variables showed significantly different associations in the 2 samples (interacted) with low ambulatory care utilization. The variables with significant interactions (P values for interaction shown below) had very different adjusted odds ratios (and 95% confidence intervals) for low ambulatory care utilization: age greater than 50 (Outreach 0.55 [0.35-0.88], HCSUS 1.17 [0.65-2.11)], P = 0.05), Hispanic ethnicity (Outreach 0.81 [0.39-1.69], HCSUS 2.34 [1.56-3.52], P = 0.02), low income (Outreach 0.73 [0.56-0.96], HCSUS 1.35 [1.04-1.75], P = 0.002), and heavy alcohol use (Outreach 1.74 [1.23-2.45], HCSUS 1.00 [0.73-1.37], P = 0.02). Having CD4 count less than 50 was associated with elevated odds of low ambulatory medical visits in the Outreach sample (1.53 [1.00-2.36], P = 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with HCSUS, the Outreach sample had far greater proportions of traditionally vulnerable groups, and were less likely to be in care if they had low CD4 counts. Furthermore, heavy alcohol use was only associated with low ambulatory utilization in Outreach. Generalizing from in care populations may not be warranted, while addressing heavy alcohol use may be effective at improving utilization of care for hard-to-reach HIV-positive populations.",2,PRIMARY,Continuous Adherence,Percentage of doses taken of those prescribed from electronic monitoring.

OPTIONS AND OUTCOMES: For persons in whom a high blood pressure value is recorded, a diagnosis of hypertension is dependent on the appropriate measurement of blood pressure, the level of the blood pressure elevation, the approach used to monitor blood pressure (office, ambulatory or home/self), and the duration of follow-up. In addition, the presence of cardiovascular risk factors and target organ damage should be assessed to determine the urgency, intensity and type of treatment. For persons diagnosed as having hypertension, estimating the overall risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes requires an assessment for other vascular risk factors and hypertensive target organ damage.
EVIDENCE: MEDLINE searches were conducted from November 2004 to October 2005 to update the 2005 recommendations. Reference lists were scanned, experts were polled, and the personal files of the authors and subgroup members were used to identify other studies. Identified articles were reviewed and appraised using prespecified levels of evidence by content and methodological experts. As per previous years, the authors only included studies that had been published in the peer-reviewed literature and did not include evidence from abstracts, conference presentations or unpublished personal communications.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The present document contains recommendations for blood pressure measurement, diagnosis of hypertension, and assessment of cardiovascular risk for adults with high blood pressure. These include the accurate measurement of blood pressure, criteria for the diagnosis of hypertension and recommendations for follow-up, assessment of overall cardiovascular risk, routine and optional laboratory testing, assessment for renovascular and endocrine causes, home and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and the role of echocardiography for those with hypertension. Key features of the 2006 recommendations include continued emphasis on an expedited diagnosis of hypertension, an in-depth review of the role of global risk assessment in hypertension therapy, and the use of home/self blood pressure monitoring for patients with masked hypertension (subjects with hypertension who have a blood pressure that is normal in clinic but elevated on home/self measurement).
VALIDATION: All recommendations were graded according to the strength of the evidence and were voted on by the 45 members of the Canadian Hypertension Education Program Evidence-Based Recommendations Task Force. All recommendations reported herein received at least 95% consensus.

Regarding the treatment of anxiety, study outcomes are inconsistent, probably because of the heterogenity of anxiety disorders/study designs. To specifically evaluate the impact of rTMS on emotion regulation in fear-relevant situations we applied a sham-controlled activating protocol (intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation/iTBS) over the left PFC (F3) succeeded by a virtual reality (VR) challenge in n=41 participants with spider phobia and n=42 controls. Prior to/after iTBS and following VR prefrontal activation was assessed by functional near-infrared spectroscopy during an emotional Stroop paradigm. Performance (reaction times/error rates) was evaluated. Stimuli were rated regarding valence/arousal at both measurements. We found diminished activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) of participants with spider phobia compared to controls, particularly elicited by emotionally-irrelevant words. Simultaneously, a functional connectivity analysis showed increased co-activation between the left IFG and the contra-lateral hemisphere. Behavioural performance was unimpaired. After iTBS/VR no significant differences in cortical activation between the phobic and control group remained. However, verum-iTBS did not cause an additional augmentation. We interpreted our results in terms of a prefrontal network which gets activated by emotionally-relevant stimuli and supports the maintenance of adequate behavioural reactions. The missing add-on effects of iTBS might be due to a ceiling effect of VR, thereby supporting its potential during exposure therapy. Concurrently, it implies that the efficient application of iTBS in the context of emotion regulation still needs to be studied further.",2,PRIMARY,"Behavioral Approach Test, Change in Steps Completed",The difference between the number of steps completed during the pre- and post-treatment behavioral approach tests.,"Active iTBS, Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex (vmPFC)","Control iTBS, Vertex","Stimulation intensity of 100% of the individual resting motor threshold in bursts of three pulses at a frequency of 50 Hz every 200 ms on top of a 5Hz carrier wave.

The efficacy of intensive treatment of hyperglycemia in this setting remains unknown.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy of intensive treatment of hyperglycemia during acute ischemic stroke.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Stroke Hyperglycemia Insulin Network Effort (SHINE) randomized clinical trial included adult patients with hyperglycemia (glucose concentration of >110 mg/dL if had diabetes or ≥150 mg/dL if did not have diabetes) and acute ischemic stroke who were enrolled within 12 hours from stroke onset at 63 US sites between April 2012 and August 2018; follow-up ended in November 2018. The trial included 1151 patients who met eligibility criteria.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to receive continuous intravenous insulin using a computerized decision support tool (target blood glucose concentration of 80-130 mg/dL [4.4-7.2 mmol/L]; intensive treatment group: n = 581) or insulin on a sliding scale that was administered subcutaneously (target blood glucose concentration of 80-179 mg/dL [4.4-9.9 mmol/L]; standard treatment group: n = 570) for up to 72 hours.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of patients with a favorable outcome based on the 90-day modified Rankin Scale score (a global stroke disability scale ranging from 0 [no symptoms or completely recovered] to 6 [death]) that was adjusted for baseline stroke severity.
RESULTS: Among 1151 patients who were randomized (mean age, 66 years [SD, 13.1 years]; 529 [46%] women, 920 [80%] with diabetes), 1118 (97%) completed the trial. Enrollment was stopped for futility based on prespecified interim analysis criteria. During treatment, the mean blood glucose level was 118 mg/dL (6.6 mmol/L) in the intensive treatment group and 179 mg/dL (9.9 mmol/L) in the standard treatment group. A favorable outcome occurred in 119 of 581 patients (20.5%) in the intensive treatment group and in 123 of 570 patients (21.6%) in the standard treatment group (adjusted relative risk, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.08], P = .55; unadjusted risk difference, -0.83% [95% CI, -5.72% to 4.06%]). Treatment was stopped early for hypoglycemia or other adverse events in 65 of 581 patients (11.2%) in the intensive treatment group and in 18 of 570 patients (3.2%) in the standard treatment group. Severe hypoglycemia occurred only among patients in the intensive treatment group (15/581 [2.6%]; risk difference, 2.58% [95% CI, 1.29% to 3.87%]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with acute ischemic stroke and hyperglycemia, treatment with intensive vs standard glucose control for up to 72 hours did not result in a significant difference in favorable functional outcome at 90 days. These findings do not support using intensive glucose control in this setting.

Rehabilitation regimens have been proposed to improve spinal stability via selective recruitment of certain trunk muscle groups. This biomechanical analytical study addressed whether lumbar spinal stability is increased by such selective activation.
METHODS: The biomechanical model included anatomically realistic three-layers of curved abdominal musculature, rectus abdominis and 77 symmetrical pairs of dorsal muscles. The muscle activations were calculated with the model loaded with either flexion, extension, lateral bending or axial rotation moments up to 60 Nm, along with intra-abdominal pressure up to 5 or 10 kPa (37.5 or 75 mm Hg) and partial bodyweight. After solving for muscle forces, a buckling analysis quantified spinal stability. Subsequently, different patterns of muscle activation were studied by forcing activation of selected abdominal muscles to at least 10% or 20% of maximum.
FINDINGS: Spinal stability increased by an average factor of 1.8 with doubling of intra-abdominal pressure. Forcing at least 10% activation of obliques or transversus abdominis muscles increased stability slightly for efforts other than flexion, but forcing at least 20% activation generally did not produce further increase in stability. Forced activation of rectus abdominis did not increase stability.
INTERPRETATION: Based on analytical predictions, the degree of stability was not substantially influenced by selective forcing of muscle activation. This casts doubt on the supposed mechanism of action of specific abdominal muscle exercise regimens that have been proposed for low back pain rehabilitation.",2,PRIMARY,Change From Baseline to 6 Months in Oswestry Disability Scale (0-100%),Disability; Sacle 0-100% Lower score is considered better/improved; Negative value indicates improvement,Stabilization,Strengthening and Conditioning,"Stabilization

Stabilization exercise protocol: The stabilization exercise protocol consists of exercises focused on improving the ability of trunk muscles to stabilize the spine, beginning with training to isolate the deeper abdominal muscles as well as deep dorsal trunk muscles. Then patients were progressed to exercises that added leverage of the limbs while maintaining the co-contraction of the deeper abdominal muscles and deep dorsal trunk muscles while breathing normally. Various positions (e.g., supine and quadruped positions) were used to challenge the patients based on their tolerance. Finally, patients were progressed to exercises in more functional positions that included tasks/activities that were reported as challenging and/or painful; patients performed the tasks at the speed demanded by the particular task. Maintenance of the co-contraction of deep trunk muscles was emphasized during these functional activities.","Strength and conditioning exercise protocol: This protocol contained trunk strengthening and endurance exercises. It consisted of 3 phases: 1) initial strengthening of trunk flexors/extensors in single plane movements, 2) trunk and lower-extremity stretching as well as progression of trunk-strengthening exercises to include multi-planar trunk movements. Aerobic exercises were progressed as tolerated and patient education about body biomechanics were reinforced, and 3) trunk-strengthening exercises under dynamic conditions (e.g., unstable support surface and in multi-planar trunk movements). During the 10 week protocol, exercises became more challenging, and each subject had to complete at least the first phase before moving onto the next phase in order to be included in post-testing analyses.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the survival benefit of administering sapacitabine, an oral nucleoside analogue, in alternating cycles with decitabine, a low-intensity therapy, to elderly patients with newly diagnosed AML.
METHODS: This randomized, open-label, phase 3 study (SEAMLESS) was conducted at 87 sites in 11 countries. Patients aged ≥70 years who were not candidates for or chose not to receive standard induction chemotherapy were randomized 1:1 to arm A (decitabine in alternating cycles with sapacitabine) received 1-hour intravenous infusions of decitabine 20 mg/m
RESULTS: Between October 2011 and December 2014, 482 patients were enrolled and randomized to receive decitabine administered in alternating cycles with sapacitabine (study arm, n = 241) or decitabine monotherapy (control arm, n = 241). The median OS was 5.9 months on the study arm versus 5.7 months on the control arm (P = .8902). The CR rate was 16.6% on the study arm and 10.8% on the control arm (P = .1468). In patients with white blood cell counts <10 × 10
CONCLUSIONS: The regimen of decitabine administered in alternating cycles with sapacitabine was active but did not significantly improve OS compared with decitabine monotherapy. Subgroup analyses suggest that patients with baseline white blood cell counts <10 × 10",1,PRIMARY,Overall Survival,The distribution of overall survival was estimated by the method of Kaplan and Meier.

We designed the second Cilostazol Stroke Prevention Study (CSPS 2) to establish non-inferiority of cilostazol versus aspirin for prevention of stroke, and to compare the efficacy and safety of cilostazol and aspirin in patients with non-cardioembolic ischaemic stroke.
METHODS: Patients aged 20-79 years who had had a cerebral infarction within the previous 26 weeks were enrolled at 278 sites in Japan and allocated to receive 100 mg cilostazol twice daily or 81 mg aspirin once daily for 1-5 years. Patients were allocated according to a computer-generated randomisation sequence by means of a dynamic balancing method using patient information obtained at registration. All patients, study personnel, investigators, and the sponsor were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of stroke (cerebral infarction, cerebral haemorrhage, or subarachnoid haemorrhage). The predefined margin of non-inferiority was an upper 95% CI limit for the hazard ratio of 1·33. Analyses were by full-analysis set. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00234065.
FINDINGS: Between December, 2003, and October, 2006, 2757 patients were enrolled and randomly allocated to receive cilostazol (n=1379) or aspirin (n=1378), of whom 1337 on cilostazol and 1335 on aspirin were included in analyses; mean follow-up was 29 months (SD 16). The primary endpoint occurred at yearly rates of 2·76% (n=82) in the cilostazol group and 3·71% (n=119) in the aspirin group (hazard ratio 0·743, 95% CI 0·564-0·981; p=0·0357). Haemorrhagic events (cerebral haemorrhage, subarachnoid haemorrhage, or haemorrhage requiring hospital admission) occurred in fewer patients on cilostazol (0·77%, n=23) than on aspirin (1·78%, n=57; 0·458, 0·296-0·711; p=0·0004), but headache, diarrhoea, palpitation, dizziness, and tachycardia were more frequent in the cilostazol group than in the aspirin group.
INTERPRETATION: Cilostazol seems to be non-inferior, and might be superior, to aspirin for prevention of stroke after an ischaemic stroke, and was associated with fewer haemorrhagic events. Therefore, cilostazol could be used for prevention of stroke in patients with non-cardioembolic stroke.

Fortunately, risk scores have been developed to better manage this outcome in hospitalized patients, but there is currently no risk score for postdischarge nausea and vomiting (PDNV) in ambulatory surgical patients.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective multicenter study of 2,170 adults undergoing general anesthesia at ambulatory surgery centers in the United States from 2007 to 2008. PDNV was assessed from discharge until the end of the second postoperative day. Logistic regression analysis was applied to a development dataset and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was calculated in a validation dataset.
RESULTS: The overall incidence of PDNV was 37%. Logistic regression analysis of the development dataset (n=1,913) identified five independent predictors (odds ratio; 95% CI): female gender (1.54; 1.22 to 1.94), age less than 50 yr (2.17; 1.75 to 2.69), history of nausea and/or vomiting after previous anesthesia (1.50; 1.19 to 1.88), opioid administration in the postanesthesia care unit (1.93; 1.53 to 2.43), and nausea in the postanesthesia care unit (3.14; 2.44-4.04). In the validation dataset (n=257), zero, one, two, three, four, and five of these factors were associated with a PDNV incidence of 7%, 20%, 28%, 53%, 60%, and 89%, respectively, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.72 (0.69 to 0.73).

Sugammadex reverses neuromuscular block by encapsulating rocuronium. However, its effects on upper airway integrity and breathing are unknown.
METHODS: Fifty-one adult male rats were anaesthetized with isoflurane, tracheostomized, and a femoral artery and vein were cannulated. First, we compared the efficacy of sugammadex 15 mg kg(-1) and neostigmine 0.06 mg kg(-1) to reverse respiratory effects of rocuronium-induced partial paralysis [train-of-four ratio (T4/T1)=0.5]. Subsequently, we compared the safety of sugammadex and neostigmine given after recovery of the T4/T1 to 1, by measuring phasic genioglossus activity and breathing.
RESULTS: During partial paralysis (T4/T1=0.5), time to recovery of minute volume to baseline values was 10.9 (2), 75.8 (18), and 153 (54) s with sugammadex, neostigmine, and placebo, respectively (sugammadex was significantly faster than neostigmine and placebo, P<0.05). Recovery of T4/T1 was also faster for sugammadex than neostigmine and placebo. Neostigmine administration after complete recovery of T4/T1 decreased upper airway dilator muscle activity to 64 (30)% of baseline and decreased tidal volume (P<0.05 for both variables), whereas sugammadex had no effect on either variable.
CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to neostigmine, which significantly impairs upper airway dilator muscle activity when given after recovery from neuromuscular block, a reversal dose of sugammadex given under the same conditions does not affect genioglossus muscle activity and normal breathing.

An increase in ASL salt concentration inhibits the activity of airway antimicrobial factors and may partially explain the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis (CF). We tested the hypothesis that an osmolyte with a low transepithelial permeability may lower the ASL salt concentration, thereby enhancing innate immunity. We found that the five-carbon sugar xylitol has a low transepithelial permeability, is poorly metabolized by several bacteria, and can lower the ASL salt concentration in both CF and non-CF airway epithelia in vitro. Furthermore, in a double-blind, randomized, crossover study, xylitol sprayed for 4 days into each nostril of normal volunteers significantly decreased the number of nasal coagulase-negative Staphylococcus compared with saline control.

We conducted a trial to assess the efficacy and safety of adalimumab as a glucocorticoid-sparing agent for the treatment of noninfectious uveitis.
METHODS: This multinational phase 3 trial involved adults who had active noninfectious intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, or panuveitis despite having received prednisone treatment for 2 or more weeks. Investigators and patients were unaware of the study-group assignments. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive adalimumab (a loading dose of 80 mg followed by a dose of 40 mg every 2 weeks) or matched placebo. All patients received a mandatory prednisone burst followed by tapering of prednisone over the course of 15 weeks. The primary efficacy end point was the time to treatment failure occurring at or after week 6. Treatment failure was a multicomponent outcome that was based on assessment of new inflammatory lesions, best corrected visual acuity, anterior chamber cell grade, and vitreous haze grade. Nine ranked secondary efficacy end points were assessed, and adverse events were reported.
RESULTS: The median time to treatment failure was 24 weeks in the adalimumab group and 13 weeks in the placebo group. Among the 217 patients in the intention-to-treat population, those receiving adalimumab were less likely than those in the placebo group to have treatment failure (hazard ratio, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.36 to 0.70; P<0.001). Outcomes with regard to three secondary end points (change in anterior chamber cell grade, change in vitreous haze grade, and change in best corrected visual acuity) were significantly better in the adalimumab group than in the placebo group. Adverse events and serious adverse events were reported more frequently among patients who received adalimumab (1052.4 vs. 971.7 adverse events and 28.8 vs. 13.6 serious adverse events per 100 person-years).
CONCLUSIONS: In our trial, adalimumab was found to be associated with a lower risk of uveitic flare or visual impairment and with more adverse events and serious adverse events than was placebo.

DESIGN AND METHODS: Data illustrating the use of the intervention were displayed for 93 veterans and their caregivers after 12 months in PDC. Descriptive data were provided for each major component of the intervention protocol, including: initial assessment, goals, action steps, and on-going monitoring. Care coordinators completed a 12-item questionnaire ascertaining the acceptability and feasibility of implementing PDC.
RESULTS: Data from the assessments and goals indicated areas of need were not limited to any one issue or subset of issues, but were widely distributed across a variety of domains. Findings for action steps suggested a primary focus on getting/giving information and action-oriented tasks to access services and programs. Most action steps were assigned and completed by veteran's spouses and the majority were successfully accomplished. On average, families had two contacts per month with care coordinators. Few barriers were indicated by care coordinators in implementing PDC, highlighting the acceptability and feasibility of the PDC protocol.

Zilucoplan is a subcutaneous, self-administered macrocyclic peptide complement C5 inhibitor. We aimed to assess safety, efficacy, and tolerability of zilucoplan in patients with acetylcholine receptor autoantibody (AChR)-positive generalised myasthenia gravis.
METHODS: RAISE was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial that was done at 75 sites in Europe, Japan, and North America. We enrolled patients (aged 18-74 years) with AChR-positive generalised myasthenia gravis (Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America disease class II-IV), a myasthenia gravis activities of daily living (MG-ADL) score of least 6, and a quantitative myasthenia gravis score of at least 12. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive subcutaneous zilucoplan 0·3 mg/kg once daily by self-injection, or matched placebo, for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline to week 12 in MG-ADL score in the modified intention-to-treat population (all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one post-dosing MG-ADL score). Safety was mainly assessed by the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in all patients who had received at least one dose of zilucoplan or placebo. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04115293. An open-label extension study is ongoing (NCT04225871).
FINDINGS: Between Sept 17, 2019, and Sept 10, 2021, 239 patients were screened for the study, of whom 174 (73%) were eligible. 86 (49%) patients were randomly assigned to zilucoplan 0·3 mg/kg and 88 (51%) were assigned to placebo. Patients assigned to zilucoplan showed a greater reduction in MG-ADL score from baseline to week 12, compared with those assigned to placebo (least squares mean change -4·39 [95% CI -5·28 to -3·50] vs -2·30 [-3·17 to -1·43]; least squares mean difference -2·09 [-3·24 to -0·95]; p=0·0004). TEAEs occurred in 66 (77%) patients in the zilucoplan group and in 62 (70%) patients in the placebo group. The most common TEAE was injection-site bruising (n=14 [16%] in the zilucoplan group and n=8 [9%] in the placebo group). Incidences of serious TEAEs and serious infections were similar in both groups. One patient died in each group; neither death (COVID-19 [zilucoplan] and cerebral haemorrhage [placebo]) was considered related to the study drug.
INTERPRETATION: Zilucoplan treatment showed rapid and clinically meaningful improvements in myasthenia gravis-specific efficacy outcomes, had a favourable safety profile, and was well tolerated, with no major safety findings. Zilucoplan is a new potential treatment option for a broad population of patients with AChR-positive generalised myasthenia gravis. The long-term safety and efficacy of zilucoplan is being assessed in an ongoing open-label extension study.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the benefit of health coaching for patients with moderate to severe COPD relative to usual care.
METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial of 9 months of health coaching versus usual care for English- or Spanish-speaking patients at least 40 years of age with moderate to severe COPD. Primary outcomes were COPD-related quality of life and the dyspnea subscale of the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes were self-efficacy for managing COPD, exercise capacity (6-min walk test), and number of COPD exacerbations. Additional outcomes were COPD symptoms, lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 s percent predicted), smoking status, bed days owing to COPD, quality of care (Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care), COPD knowledge, and symptoms of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire). Outpatient visits, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations were assessed by review of medical records. Generalized linear modeling was used to adjust for baseline values and account for clustering by clinic.
RESULTS: Of 192 patients enrolled, 158 (82%) completed 9 months of follow-up. There were no significant differences between study arms for the primary or secondary outcomes. At 9 months, patients in the coached group reported better quality of care (mean Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care score, 3.30 vs. 3.18; adjusted P = 0.02) and were less likely to report symptoms of moderate to severe depression (Patient Health Questionnaire score, ≥15) than those in the usual care arm (6% vs. 20%; adjusted P = 0.01). During the study, patients in the coaching arm had 48% fewer hospitalizations related to COPD (0.27/patient/yr vs. 0.52/patient/yr), but this difference was not significant in the adjusted analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: These results help inform expectations regarding the limitations and benefits of health coaching for patients with COPD.

Eligible patients had active ankylosing spondylitis, fulfilled modified New York criteria, were previously untreated with biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, and had inadequate response to at least two or intolerance or contraindication to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 using interactive response technology to take oral upadacitinib 15 mg once daily or oral placebo for the 14-week period 1; only period 1 data are reported here. The primary endpoint was the composite outcome measure of the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society 40 response at week 14.

FINDINGS: Between Nov 30, 2017, and Oct 15, 2018, 187 patients were randomly assigned to upadacitinib 15 mg (93 patients) or to placebo (94 patients), and 178 (95%) patients (89 in the upadacitinib group and 89 in the placebo group) completed period 1 on study drug (by the completion date of Jan 21, 2019). Significantly more patients had an Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society 40 response in the upadacitinib group versus in the placebo group at week 14 (48 [52%] of 93 patients vs 24 [26%] of 94 patients; p=0·0003; treatment difference 26% [95% CI 13-40]). Adverse events were reported in 58 (62%) of 93 patients in the upadacitinib group versus 52 (55%) of 94 in the placebo group. The most common adverse event in the upadacitinib group was increased creatine phosphokinase (eight [9%] of 93 patients in the upadacitinib group vs two [2%] of 94 patients with placebo). No serious infections, herpes zoster, malignancy, venous thromboembolic events, or deaths were reported; one serious adverse event was reported in each group.

The study was randomized, stratified, blocked, and double-blind. Anesthesia was induced intravenously (I.V.) with propofol or by inhalation with halothane and N2O. Dexamethasone 150 microg/kg or perphenazine 70 microg/kg was administered I.V. after the induction of anesthesia in a double-blind fashion. Perioperative management of emesis, pain, fluids, and patient discharge was all standardized. The groups had similar demographic characteristics. Perphenazine significantly reduced the incidence of in-hospital vomiting compared with dexamethasone (13% vs 36%, P < 0.001). The incidence of out-of-hospital vomiting was almost identical. Overall, the incidence was significantly different for perphenazine vs dexamethasone (33% vs 46%, P = 0.04) using logistic regression analysis. Of note, sex and induction technique were significant predictors of postoperative vomiting (P < 0.05) using logistic regression analysis, with male patients and those patients undergoing I.V. induction vomiting less. In conclusion, perphenazine more effectively decreases vomiting by children after tonsillectomy in an ambulatory hospital setting compared with dexamethasone.
IMPLICATIONS: Postoperative vomiting can have many debilitating effects, and children undergoing tonsillectomy are at particular risk.

We evaluated rapid endovascular treatment in addition to standard care in patients with acute ischemic stroke with a small infarct core, a proximal intracranial arterial occlusion, and moderate-to-good collateral circulation.
METHODS: We randomly assigned participants to receive standard care (control group) or standard care plus endovascular treatment with the use of available thrombectomy devices (intervention group). Patients with a proximal intracranial occlusion in the anterior circulation were included up to 12 hours after symptom onset. Patients with a large infarct core or poor collateral circulation on computed tomography (CT) and CT angiography were excluded. Workflow times were measured against predetermined targets. The primary outcome was the score on the modified Rankin scale (range, 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]) at 90 days. A proportional odds model was used to calculate the common odds ratio as a measure of the likelihood that the intervention would lead to lower scores on the modified Rankin scale than would control care (shift analysis).
RESULTS: The trial was stopped early because of efficacy. At 22 centers worldwide, 316 participants were enrolled, of whom 238 received intravenous alteplase (120 in the intervention group and 118 in the control group). In the intervention group, the median time from study CT of the head to first reperfusion was 84 minutes. The rate of functional independence (90-day modified Rankin score of 0 to 2) was increased with the intervention (53.0%, vs. 29.3% in the control group; P<0.001).

Aging is associated with an impaired bioactivity of nitric oxide (NO). Plasma nitrite reflects NO-synthase activity under fasting conditions and is an important storage pool of NO.

METHODS: This randomized, open-label, phase II trial enrolled 80 postmenopausal women with high-proliferation (Ki67 index staining ≥15%), ER-positive breast cancer that progressed after a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (NCT01605396). Randomly assigned patients were given oral ridaforolimus 10 mg QD 5 ×/week, intravenous dalotuzumab 10 mg/kg/week, and oral exemestane 25 mg/day (R/D/E, n = 40), or ridaforolimus 30 mg QD 5 ×/week and exemestane 25 mg/day (R/E; n = 40).

CONCLUSIONS: R/D/E did not improve PFS compared with R/E. Because the PFS reported for R/E was similar to that reported for everolimus plus exemestane in patients with advanced breast cancer, it is possible that lower-dose ridaforolimus in the R/D/E arm (from overlapping toxicities with IGF1R inhibitor) contributed to lack of improved PFS.",0,PRIMARY,1.

However, it has not been evaluated when given in conjunction with bupivacaine and clonidine to provide blockade of the brachial plexus at the interscalene level. The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether the addition of dexamethasone to interscalene brachial plexus block would prolong the duration of sensory analgesia in a group of patients undergoing outpatient shoulder arthroscopy.
METHODS: This prospective, randomized, double-blind investigation was performed on 88 individuals undergoing shoulder arthroscopy. Patients received interscalene brachial plexus block using 20 ml of bupivacaine 5 mg ml(-1) with 1: 200,000 epinephrine and clonidine 75 microg. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either dexamethasone 8 mg or 0.9% NaCl as an adjuvant to the mixture. After discharge, patients recorded pain scores and analgesic consumption in a diary and estimated the time at which they perceived that the sensory block from the interscalene brachial plexus block resolved. This was based on pain, recovery of sensation and strength in the arm. Variables measured included demographics, timed pain intensity measurements, postoperative analgesic consumption, duration of analgesia and patient satisfaction.
RESULTS: Dexamethasone prolonged median sensory (1457 vs. 833 min, P < 0.0001) and motor (1374 vs. 827 min, P < 0.0001) blockade compared with the control. At 24 h, the dexamethasone group had lower median verbal analogue scale scores compared with control (3.0 vs. 6.0). At 48 h, the two groups had similar median pain scores (4.0 vs. 5.0, dexamethasone vs. control, respectively).

METHODS: Participants (65-85 years) met DSM-IV-TR criteria for insomnia with total sleep times (TST) < or = 6 h, and wake time after sleep onset (WASO) > or = 45 min. Participants were randomized to 12 weeks of eszopiclone 2 mg (n = 194) or placebo (n = 194), followed by a 2-week single-blind placebo run-out. Subject-reported measures of sleep (sTST, sleep latency [sSL], sWASO) and daytime function (alertness, concentration, wellbeing, ability to function) were assessed. AEs were monitored.
RESULTS: Subjects treated with 2 mg eszopiclone slept longer at night on average and at every individual time point compared to baseline than placebo subjects, as measured by TST over the 12-week double-blind period (P < 0.0001). Mean sTST over the double-blind period for eszopiclone-treated subjects was 360.08 min compared to 297.86 min at baseline, a mean change of 63.24 min. Over the double-blind period, eszopiclone-treated subjects also experienced a significantly greater improvement in sSL compared to placebo, with a mean decrease of 24.62 min versus a mean decrease of 19.92 min, respectively (P = 0.0014). Eszopiclone subjects also experienced a significantly greater decrease in WASO (mean decrease of 36.4 min) compared to placebo subjects (decrease of 14.8 min) (P < 0.0001).

METHODS: The cross-cultural adaptation was performed according to the internationally recommended methodology, using the following guidelines: translation, back-translation; revision by a committee, and pretesting. The psychometric properties were evaluated by administering the questionnaire to 120 subjects with back pain. Reliability was estimated through stability and homogeneity assessment. The validity was tested comparing ODI scores with the following measurements: Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, SF-36, and a Numerical Pain Scale.
RESULTS: Good internal consistency was found (Cronbach's alpha = 0.87). Intraclass correlation coefficient for test-retest reliability was 0.99. The ODI showed moderate correlation with pain measurement (r = 0.66). Relatively high correlation was also found between the ODI and the Roland-Morris scores (r = 0.81).

Although these naturally occurring peptides modulate pain, it is unknown whether endogenous opioids affect the perception of breathlessness associated with a specific respiratory challenge. The hypothesis is that intravenous administration of naloxone, used to block opioid signaling and inhibit neural pathways, will increase ratings of breathlessness during resistive load breathing (RLB) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
METHODS: Fourteen patients with COPD (age, 64 ± 9 years) inspired through resistances during practice sessions to identify an individualized target load that caused ratings of intensity and/or unpleasantness of breathlessness ≥ 50 mm on a 100 mm visual analog scale. At two intervention visits, serum beta-endorphins were measured, naloxone (10 mg/25 ml) or normal saline (25 ml) was administered intravenously, and patients rated the two dimensions of breathlessness each minute during RLB.
RESULTS: Patient ratings of intensity (p = 0.0004) and unpleasantness (p = 0.024) of breathlessness were higher with naloxone compared with normal saline. Eleven patients (79%) reported that it was easier to breathe during RLB with normal saline (p = 0.025). RLB led to significant increases in serum beta-endorphin immunoreactivity and decreases in inspiratory capacity. There were no significant differences in physiological responses between interventions.

This approach was used for all subjects to yield a total of 154 ratings for naloxone and for normal saline.

Strong recommendations include targeting an international normalized ratio of 2.0 to 3.0 for patients on vitamin K antagonist therapy (Grade 1B) and not routinely using pharmacogenetic testing for guiding doses of vitamin K antagonist (Grade 1B). Weak recommendations deal with such issues as loading doses, initiation overlap, monitoring frequency, vitamin K supplementation, patient self-management, weight and renal function adjustment of doses, dosing decision support, drug interactions to avoid, and prevention and management of bleeding complications.

The objective of the randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III C-EDGE IBLD study was to assess the safety and efficacy of elbasvir/grazoprevir (EBR/GZR) in patients with inherited bleeding disorders and HCV infection. One hundred fifty-nine adults with HCV infection and sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, or hemophilia A/B or von Willebrand disease were enrolled at 31 study sites in the United States, Europe, Australia, Canada, Israel, and Thailand. Patients were given an oral, once-daily, fixed-dose combination of EBR/GZR 50 mg/100 mg for 12 weeks and randomized to the immediate-treatment group (ITG) or deferred-treatment group (DTG; placebo followed by active treatment). The primary endpoints were the proportion of patients in the ITG with unquantifiable HCV RNA 12 weeks posttreatment (sustained virological response 12 weeks after completion of study treatment; SVR12) and the comparison of safety in the ITG and DTG. In the ITG, 100 of 107 patients (93.5%) achieved SVR12, 6 relapsed, and 1 was lost to follow-up. SVR12 was achieved in 94.7% (18 of 19), 97.6% (40 of 41), and 89.4% (42 of 47) of patients with sickle cell disease, β-thalassemia, and hemophilia A/B or von Willebrand disease, respectively.

In this study, we compared a reduction treatment approach with an immediate cessation approach in a population of ST users who reported no immediate plans to quit.
METHODS: Subjects randomly assigned to the immediate cessation condition set a quit date soon after enrollment and were offered 2 weeks of nicotine patch therapy to help in their cessation efforts. Subjects assigned to the ST reduction group were provided with their choice of either 4 mg nicotine lozenge or ST brand switching to help them reduce their ST use or levels of nicotine exposure, respectively. Quit date was 6 weeks after the onset of treatment. Follow-up was at 12 weeks and 26 weeks postenrollment and 26 weeks postquit.
RESULTS: Both 7-day point prevalence abstinence and prolonged abstinence rates following the quit date were significantly higher in the immediate cessation group versus the reduction group at 12 and 26 weeks (all p values ≤ .04) and for prolonged abstinence at 6 months postquit (p = .002). Significant reductions in ST use among nonquitters were observed for both groups (p < .0001) with no differences between groups.

The use of ""ketofol"" (ketamine/propofol admixture) may allow for improved hemodynamic control. The primary aim of this study was to assess the hemodynamic effects of ""ketofol"" in a fixed-dose combination during induction of general anesthesia in a controlled environment.
METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial conducted at the Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center. American Society of Anesthesiology physical status I and II patients undergoing general anesthesia were randomly assigned to standardized induction with propofol alone or with ""ketofol."" Baseline noninvasive hemodynamic measurements were obtained and continuously monitored throughout the study period. Our hypothesis assumed that ""ketofol"" as an induction alternative would produce stable hemodynamics as referenced from baseline compared with propofol alone. The primary outcome was a systematic randomized assessment of changes in systolic blood pressure from baseline measurements for 30 minutes after induction. The primary comparisons were the frequency of a 20% change in systolic blood pressure at 5 minutes, 10 minutes, and 30 minutes after induction.
RESULTS: Baseline patient demographics and intraoperative characteristics were equivalent in both groups.

Given that low adherence is associated with poorer response to treatment, this is a likely source of unequal care. The current study examined the efficacy of a motivational interviewing intervention for improving antidepressant adherence among Latinos with a depressive disorder.
METHODS: Participants were 50 Latinos with a DSM-IV diagnosis of major depression or dysthymia who were receiving treatment at a community mental health center. Participants were recruited from July 2007 to December 2009 and were randomized to receive usual care (UC) or Motivational Enhancement Therapy for Antidepressants (META). META participants received three sessions of motivational interviewing as an enhancement to their usual care. Participants were assessed as baseline (time 1), 5 weeks (time 2), and 5 months (time 3). Antidepressant adherence was measured with the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS®) and changes in depression were measured with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II).
RESULTS: After adjusting for covariates, META participants showed significantly higher antidepressant adherence than UC participants at time 2 (72% versus 42%, respectively, p < .01) and time 3 (60% versus 34%, p < .01). The groups did not differ on mean BDI-II score across time. However, after adjusting for covariates, META participants were significantly more likely to show symptom remission on the BDI-II, compared to UC participants (OR = 7.0, p < .05).
CONCLUSIONS: This initial trial of META demonstrated feasibility and promising effects for improving antidepressant adherence. Some effects on depression were also observed.",1,PRIMARY,"Medication Adherence, as Measured by Electronic Pill Container","Medication container caps (MEMS) recorded each instance where the antidepressant medication container was opened.

High-flow oxygen is effective in cluster headache and has shown promise in animal models of migraine, but has not been adequately studied in patients with migraine. Methods In this randomized, crossover-design, placebo-controlled trial, adult migraineurs self-administered high-flow oxygen or medical air at 10-15 l/min via face mask in blinded fashion starting soon after symptom onset for 30 minutes, for a total of four migraine attacks. Participants recorded the severity of headache, nausea, and visual symptoms on visual analog scales periodically up to 60 minutes. Results We enrolled 22 individuals (mean age 36 years, 20 women) who self-treated 64 migraine attacks (33 oxygen, 31 air). The pre-specified primary endpoint (mean decrease in pain score from baseline to 30 minutes) was 1.38 ± 1.42 in oxygen-treated and 1.22 ± 1.61 in air-treated attacks ( p = 0.674). Oxygen therapy resulted in relief (severity score 0-1) of pain (24% versus 6%, p = 0.05), nausea (42% versus 23%, p = 0.08) and visual symptoms (36% versus 7%, p = 0.004) at 60 minutes. Exploratory analysis showed that in moderately severe attacks (baseline pain score <6), pain relief was achieved in six of 13 (46%) oxygen versus one of 15 (7%) air ( p = 0.02). Gas therapy was used per protocol in 91% of attacks. There were no significant adverse events. Conclusion High-flow oxygen may be a feasible and safe strategy to treat acute migraine.

This is the first phase III study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of aprepitant in patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC) in Asian countries.
METHODS: This multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial assessed the prevention of CINV during the acute phase (AP), delayed phase (DP), and overall phase (OP).

In this randomized controlled trial we examined the effects of music on sensation and distress of pain in Thai primiparous women during the active phase of labor. The gate control theory of pain was the theoretical framework for this study. Randomization with a computerized minimization program was used to assign women to a music group (n = 55) or a control group (n = 55). Women in the intervention group listened to soft music without lyrics for 3 hours starting early in the active phase of labor. Dual visual analog scales were used to measure sensation and distress of pain before starting the study and at three hourly posttests. While controlling for pretest scores, one-way repeated measures analysis of covariance indicated that those in the music group had significantly less sensation and distress of pain than did the control group (F (1, 107) = 18.69, p <.001, effect size =.15, and F (1, 107) = 14.87, p <.001, effect size =.12), respectively.

METHODS: This multicenter, double-blind randomized controlled trial compared the efficacy and safety of SARS-CoV-2 high titer convalescent plasma to placebo control plasma in symptomatic adults ≥18 years positive for SARS-CoV-2 regardless of risk factors for disease progression or vaccine status. Participants with symptom onset within 8 days were enrolled, then transfused within the subsequent day. The measured primary outcome was COVID-19-related hospitalization within 28 days of plasma transfusion. The enrollment period was June 3, 2020 to October 1, 2021.
RESULTS: A total of 1225 participants were randomized and 1181 transfused. In the pre-specified modified intention-to-treat analysis that excluded those not transfused, the primary endpoint occurred in 37 of 589 (6.3%) who received placebo control plasma and in 17 of 592 (2.9%) participants who received convalescent plasma (relative risk, 0.46; one-sided 95% upper bound confidence interval 0.733; P=0.004) corresponding to a 54% risk reduction. Examination with a model adjusting for covariates related to the outcome did not change the conclusions.
CONCLUSION: Early administration of high titer SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma reduced outpatient hospitalizations by more than 50%. High titer convalescent plasma is an effective early outpatient COVID-19 treatment with the advantages of low cost, wide availability, and rapid resilience to variant emergence from viral genetic drift in the face of a changing pandemic.

An injection of autologous blood might provide the necessary cellular and humoral mediators to induce a healing cascade. The purpose of this study was to evaluate prospectively the results of refractory lateral epicondylitis treated with autologous blood injections.
METHOD: Twenty-eight patients with lateral epicondylitis were injected with 2 mL of autologous blood under the extensor carpi radialis brevis. All patients had failed previous nonsurgical treatments including all or combinations of physical therapy, splinting, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication, and prior steroid injections. Patients kept personal logs and rated their pain (0-10) and categorized themselves according to Nirschl staging (0-7) daily.
RESULTS: The average follow-up period was 9.5 months (range, 6-24 mo). After autologous blood injections the average pain score decreased from 7.8 to 2.3. The average Nirschl stage decreased from 6.5 to 2.0. For the 9 patients receiving more than one blood injection the mean pain score and Nirschl stage before injection were 7.2 and 6.6, respectively. After the second blood injection the pain and Nirschl scores were both 0.9. Two patients received a third blood injection that brought both pain and Nirschl scores to 0.

However, there are no double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors in chronic depressive disorder.
METHOD: Outpatients with chronic depressive disorder, but without concurrent major depressive disorder (MDD), were randomly assigned to prospective double-blind duloxetine (beginning at 30 mg/d, increased to a maximum dose of 120 mg/d) versus placebo for 10 weeks. Inclusion criteria were current DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of dysthymic disorder or depression not otherwise specified, age 18-75 years, and a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score ≥ 12. Exclusion criteria included current major depression. The study was conducted between August 2006 and December 2011. HDRS, Cornell Dysthymia Rating Scale (CDRS), Clinical Global Impressions (CGI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), Social Adjustment Scale (SAS), and other assessments were administered at each visit. We hypothesized that duloxetine would be superior to placebo in (1) 24-item HDRS total score, (2) the percentage of subjects classified as responders and remitters, and (3) secondary measures (CDRS, BDI, CGI). Response was defined as > 50% decrease in 24-item HDRS and CGI-Improvement scale score of 1 or 2 (""very much improved"" or ""much improved""). Remission was defined as HDRS-17 item score ≤ 4 and 0 on item 1 of the HDRS (depressed mood).
RESULTS: 65 subjects were enrolled, of whom 57 began medication. They ranged in age from 19 to 70 years (mean ± SD = 41.63 ± 11.22) and included 24 women and 33 men. Baseline 24-item HDRS score (mean ± SD) for both groups was 20.75 ± 4.92. After 10 weeks, duloxetine-treated subjects had significantly lower 24-item HDRS scores than placebo-treated subjects (time-by-drug group effect on analysis of variance: F1,55 = 9.43, P = .003). Responder and remitter analyses significantly favored duloxetine treatment. The response rate was 65.5% for duloxetine versus 25.0% for placebo (χ(2)(1) = 9.43, P = .003); and the remitter rate was 55.2% for duloxetine versus 14.3% for placebo (χ(2)(1) = 10.46, P = .002). After 10 weeks, duloxetine-treated subjects did not differ significantly better from placebo-treated subjects on the SAS (time-by-drug group effect on analysis of variance: F(1,46) = 0.35, P = .555) or on the GAF (time-by-drug group effect on analysis of variance: F(1,51) = .01, P = .922).
CONCLUSIONS: Results on the 24-item HDRS, CGI, and CDRS suggest that duloxetine is efficacious in acute treatment of chronic nonmajor depressive disorder. Response and remission rates also differed significantly, favoring duloxetine treatment, but BDI, GAF, and social functioning (Social Adjustment Scale) did not. Duloxetine appears to be effective in acute treatment of nonmajor chronic depression.

We aimed to examine associations of quantitative gastrointestinal and psychological traits with obesity, and to validate the ability of these traits to predict responses of obese individuals to pharmacotherapy.
METHODS: In a prospective study, we measured gastric emptying of solids and liquids, fasting and postprandial gastric volume, satiation by nutrient drink test (volume to fullness and maximal tolerated volume), satiety after an ad libitum buffet meal, gastrointestinal hormones, and psychological traits in 328 normal-weight, overweight, or obese adults. We also analyzed data from 181 previously studied adults to assess associations betwecen a subset of traits with body mass index and waist circumference. Latent dimensions associated with overweight or obesity were appraised by principal component analyses. We performed a proof of concept, placebo-controlled trial of extended-release phentermine and topiramate in 24 patients to validate associations between quantitative traits and response to weight-loss therapy.
RESULTS: In the prospective study, obesity was associated with fasting gastric volume (P = .03), accelerated gastric emptying (P < .001 for solids and P = .011 for liquids), lower postprandial levels of peptide tyrosine tyrosine (P = .003), and higher postprandial levels of glucagon-like peptide 1 (P < .001). In a combined analysis of data from all studies, obesity was associated with higher volume to fullness (n = 509; P = .038) and satiety with abnormal waist circumference (n = 271; P = .016). Principal component analysis identified latent dimensions that accounted for approximately 81% of the variation among overweight and obese subjects, including satiety or satiation (21%), gastric motility (14%), psychological factors (13%), and gastric sensorimotor factors (11%). The combination of phentermine and topiramate caused significant weight loss, slowed gastric emptying, and decreased calorie intake; weight loss in response to phentermine and topiramate was significantly associated with calorie intake at the prior satiety test.
CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative traits are associated with high body mass index; they can distinguish obesity phenotypes and, in a proof of concept clinical trial, predicted response to pharmacotherapy for obesity.

This study of the 2002-2003 influenza season examines factors that may be associated with low coverage.
METHODS: A national sample of 1839 community-dwelling adults aged > or = 65 years was surveyed by telephone during January-May 2003. Outcomes analyzed in 2004-2005 included self-reported influenza vaccination and PPV; place of vaccination; and among the unvaccinated, main reasons for nonvaccination, awareness of vaccination, and receipt of provider recommendation for vaccination.
RESULTS: Influenza vaccine coverage was 67.8%, and PPV coverage was 60%. Coverage among blacks and Hispanics was > or = 15 percentage points below that of whites. Half (52%) of persons who had not received PPV were aware it was recommended for persons their age, and < 10% had received a recent physician recommendation for PPV. Concern about side effects and not thinking that they needed the vaccine were the most frequently cited reasons for not receiving an influenza vaccination. In each racial/ethnic group, prevalence of potential missed opportunities (recent doctor visit, but no vaccine recommendation from provider and no influenza vaccination) was higher than prevalence of potential vaccine refusal (recent doctor visit and vaccine recommendation from provider, but no vaccine): blacks, 26.9% versus 7.9%; Hispanics, 19.9% versus 12.1%; and white non-Hispanics, 16.2% versus 6.1%.

Tolvaptan, a vasopressin V2 receptor blocker, shows promise for management of heart failure.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of tolvaptan initiated in patients hospitalized with heart failure.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Efficacy of Vasopressin Antagonism in Heart Failure Outcome Study With Tolvaptan (EVEREST), an event-driven, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The outcome trial comprised 4133 patients within 2 short-term clinical status studies, who were hospitalized with heart failure, randomized at 359 North American, South American, and European sites between October 7, 2003, and February 3, 2006, and followed up during long-term treatment.
INTERVENTION: Within 48 hours of admission, patients were randomly assigned to receive oral tolvaptan, 30 mg once per day (n = 2072), or placebo (n = 2061) for a minimum of 60 days, in addition to standard therapy.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Dual primary end points were all-cause mortality (superiority and noninferiority) and cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure (superiority only). Secondary end points included changes in dyspnea, body weight, and edema.
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 9.9 months, 537 patients (25.9%) in the tolvaptan group and 543 (26.3%) in the placebo group died (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.87-1.11; P = .68). The upper confidence limit for the mortality difference was within the prespecified noninferiority margin of 1.25 (P<.001). The composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure occurred in 871 tolvaptan group patients (42.0%) and 829 placebo group patients (40.2%; hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.95-1.14; P = .55). Secondary end points of cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular death or hospitalization, and worsening heart failure were also not different. Tolvaptan significantly improved secondary end points of day 1 patient-assessed dyspnea, day 1 body weight, and day 7 edema. In patients with hyponatremia, serum sodium levels significantly increased. The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire overall summary score was not improved at outpatient week 1, but body weight and serum sodium effects persisted long after discharge. Tolvaptan caused increased thirst and dry mouth, but frequencies of major adverse events were similar in the 2 groups.
CONCLUSION: Tolvaptan initiated for acute treatment of patients hospitalized with heart failure had no effect on long-term mortality or heart failure-related morbidity.

Smoking cessation approaches that incorporate a focus on PA may benefit smokers trying to quit. The purpose of this study was to conduct a pilot randomized clinical trial to compare standard smoking cessation treatment (ST) with smoking cessation treatment that targets positive affect, termed positive psychotherapy for smoking cessation (PPT-S).
METHOD: Smokers who were seeking smoking cessation treatment were assigned by urn randomization to receive, along with 8 weeks of nicotine replacement therapy, either ST (n = 31) or PPT-S (n = 35). Seven-day point prevalence smoking abstinence was biochemically confirmed at 8, 16, and 26 weeks.
RESULTS: Compared to ST, a greater percentage of participants in PPT-S were abstinent at 8 weeks, 16 weeks, and 26 weeks, but these differences were nonsignificant. In a more statistically powerful longitudinal model, participants in PPT-S had a significantly higher odds of abstinence (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.75; 95% CI = 1.02, 7.42; p = .046) across follow-ups compared to those in ST. The positive effect of PPT-S was stronger for those higher in PA (OR = 6.69, 95% CI = 1.16, 38.47, p = .03). Greater use of PPT-S strategies during the initial 8 weeks of quitting was associated with a less steep decline in smoking abstinence rates over time (OR = 2.64, 95% CI = 1.06, 6.56, p =.04).

We hypothesized that lower treatment-related mortality (TRM) with reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) would result in improved overall survival (OS) compared with myeloablative conditioning (MAC). To test this hypothesis, we performed a phase III randomized trial comparing MAC with RIC in patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes. Patients and Methods Patients age 18 to 65 years with HCT comorbidity index ≤ 4 and < 5% marrow myeloblasts pre-HCT were randomly assigned to receive MAC (n = 135) or RIC (n = 137) followed by HCT from HLA-matched related or unrelated donors. The primary end point was OS 18 months post-random assignment based on an intent-to-treat analysis. Secondary end points included relapse-free survival (RFS) and TRM. Results Planned enrollment was 356 patients; accrual ceased at 272 because of high relapse incidence with RIC versus MAC (48.3%; 95% CI, 39.6% to 56.4% and 13.5%; 95% CI, 8.3% to 19.8%, respectively; P < .001). At 18 months, OS for patients in the RIC arm was 67.7% (95% CI, 59.1% to 74.9%) versus 77.5% (95% CI, 69.4% to 83.7%) for those in the MAC arm (difference, 9.8%; 95% CI, -0.8% to 20.3%; P = .07). TRM with RIC was 4.4% (95% CI, 1.8% to 8.9%) versus 15.8% (95% CI, 10.2% to 22.5%) with MAC ( P = .002). RFS with RIC was 47.3% (95% CI, 38.7% to 55.4%) versus 67.8% (95% CI, 59.1% to 75%) with MAC ( P < .01). Conclusion OS was higher with MAC, but this was not statistically significant.

METHODS: In a randomised, open-label study, 121 healthy women, 18-50 years of age, were randomly assigned to receive NOMAC/E2 (2.5 mg/1.5 mg) in a 24/4-day regimen (n=60) or LNG/EE (150 μg/30 μg) in a 21/7-day regimen (n=61) for six cycles. The primary outcome was the change from baseline to cycle 6 for all indices.
RESULTS: All parameters were similar at baseline between the two groups. Over six cycles, NOMAC/E2 had less effect on most haemostatic indices than LNG/EE. Lipids were essentially unchanged with NOMAC/E2, whereas with LNG/EE high-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides slightly increased. NOMAC/E2 induced negligible changes in glucose and insulin parameters, in contrast to LNG/EE. A much smaller increase in CRP was observed with NOMAC/E2 than with LNG/EE.

We aimed to assess whether canakinumab, a human monoclonal anti-interleukin-1 antibody, or anakinra, a human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, improved β-cell function in recent-onset type 1 diabetes.
METHODS: We did two randomised, placebo-controlled trials in two groups of patients with recent-onset type 1 diabetes and mixed-meal-tolerance-test-stimulated C peptide of at least 0·2 nM. Patients in the canakinumab trial were aged 6-45 years and those in the anakinra trial were aged 18-35 years. Patients in the canakinumab trial were enrolled at 12 sites in the USA and Canada and those in the anakinra trial were enrolled at 14 sites across Europe. Participants were randomly assigned by computer-generated blocked randomisation to subcutaneous injection of either 2 mg/kg (maximum 300 mg) canakinumab or placebo monthly for 12 months or 100 mg anakinra or placebo daily for 9 months. Participants and carers were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was baseline-adjusted 2-h area under curve C-peptide response to the mixed meal tolerance test at 12 months (canakinumab trial) and 9 months (anakinra trial). Analyses were by intention to treat. These studies are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT00947427 and NCT00711503, and EudraCT number 2007-007146-34.
FINDINGS: Patients were enrolled in the canakinumab trial between Nov 12, 2010, and April 11, 2011, and in the anakinra trial between Jan 26, 2009, and May 25, 2011. 69 patients were randomly assigned to canakinumab (n=47) or placebo (n=22) monthly for 12 months and 69 were randomly assigned to anakinra (n=35) or placebo (n=34) daily for 9 months. No interim analyses were done. 45 canakinumab-treated and 21 placebo-treated patients in the canakinumab trial and 25 anakinra-treated and 26 placebo-treated patients in the anakinra trial were included in the primary analyses. The difference in C peptide area under curve between the canakinumab and placebo groups at 12 months was 0·01 nmol/L (95% CI -0·11 to 0·14; p=0·86), and between the anakinra and the placebo groups at 9 months was 0·02 nmol/L (-0·09 to 0·15; p=0·71). The number and severity of adverse events did not differ between groups in the canakinumab trial. In the anakinra trial, patients in the anakinra group had significantly higher grades of adverse events than the placebo group (p=0·018), which was mainly because of a higher number of injection site reactions in the anakinra group.
INTERPRETATION: Canakinumab and anakinra were safe but were not effective as single immunomodulatory drugs in recent-onset type 1 diabetes. Interleukin-1 blockade might be more effective in combination with treatments that target adaptive immunity in organ-specific autoimmune disorders.

Therefore, we examined the validity of a brief, new measure of depression severity.
MEASUREMENTS: The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as ""0"" (not at all) to ""3"" (nearly every day). The PHQ-9 was completed by 6,000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics-gynecology clinics. Construct validity was assessed using the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey, self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (MHP) interview in a sample of 580 patients.
RESULTS: As PHQ-9 depression severity increased, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and health care utilization increased. Using the MHP reinterview as the criterion standard, a PHQ-9 score > or =10 had a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 88% for major depression. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. Results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics-gynecology samples.
CONCLUSION: In addition to making criteria-based diagnoses of depressive disorders, the PHQ-9 is also a reliable and valid measure of depression severity.

This study compared the use of the GlideScope with direct laryngoscopy for the laryngoscopic view and intubation time in children.
METHODS: The laryngoscopic view in 203 children was scored using both the Macintosh laryngoscope and the GlideScope using Cormack and Lehane (C&L) grades.

RESULTS: Overall, 981 participants were vaccinated in group 1 and 484 in group 2. Immune responses in group 1 to all antigens contained in DTaP5-IPV-Hib-HepB 1 month after dose 3 and for concomitant rotavirus vaccine were noninferior to those in group 2, with the exception of antipertussis filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) geometric mean concentrations (GMCs).

OBJECTIVE: Assess the impact of a patient-supporter diabetes management intervention on supporters' engagement in patients' diabetes care, support techniques, and caregiving experience.
DESIGN: Multivariate regression models examined between-group differences in support-related measures observed as part of a larger trial randomizing participants to a dyadic intervention versus usual care.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 239 adults with type 2 diabetes and either A1c >8% or systolic blood pressure >160mmHg enrolled with a family supporter.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective medical record review with explicit criteria. All patients who received oral N-acetylcysteine by the intravenous route from September 1995 to September 2001 were included. Patients were identified by cross-matching 3 databases. Adverse events were divided into categories of cutaneous, systemic, or life threatening. Five reviewers abstracted charts by using a standardized data collection form. Interrater reliability was calculated by using 24 medical records abstracted by all 5 reviewers.
RESULTS: There were 7 adverse events identified in 187 patients (3.7%; 95% confidence interval 1.0% to 6.5%). Six adverse events were cutaneous and responded rapidly to antihistamines. One adverse event was life threatening but not clearly related to N-acetylcysteine. A high rate of antihistamine exposure (53%) was identified before the administration of N-acetylcysteine.

Roughly 50% of patients might be cured after autologous stem-cell transplantation; however, most patients with unfavourable risk factors progress after transplantation. We aimed to assess whether brentuximab vedotin improves progression-free survival when given as early consolidation after autologous stem-cell transplantation.
METHODS: We did this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial at 78 sites in North America and Europe. Patients with unfavourable-risk relapsed or primary refractory classic Hodgkin's lymphoma who had undergone autologous stem-cell transplantation were randomly assigned, by fixed-block randomisation with a computer-generated random number sequence, to receive 16 cycles of 1·8 mg/kg brentuximab vedotin or placebo intravenously every 3 weeks, starting 30-45 days after transplantation. Randomisation was stratified by best clinical response after completion of salvage chemotherapy (complete response vs partial response vs stable disease) and primary refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma versus relapsed disease less than 12 months after completion of frontline therapy versus relapse 12 months or more after treatment completion. Patients and study investigators were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival by independent review, defined as the time from randomisation to the first documentation of tumour progression or death. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01100502.
FINDINGS: Between April 6, 2010, and Sept 21, 2012, we randomly assigned 329 patients to the brentuximab vedotin group (n=165) or the placebo group (n=164). Progression-free survival by independent review was significantly improved in patients in the brentuximab vedotin group compared with those in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·57, 95% CI 0·40-0·81; p=0·0013). Median progression-free survival by independent review was 42·9 months (95% CI 30·4-42·9) for patients in the brentuximab vedotin group compared with 24·1 months (11·5-not estimable) for those in the placebo group. We recorded consistent benefit (HR <1) of brentuximab vedotin consolidation across subgroups. The most frequent adverse events in the brentuximab vedotin group were peripheral sensory neuropathy (94 [56%] of 167 patients vs 25 [16%] of 160 patients in the placebo group) and neutropenia (58 [35%] vs 19 [12%] patients). At time of analysis, 28 (17%) of 167 patients had died in the brentuximab vedotin group compared with 25 (16%) of 160 patients in the placebo group.
INTERPRETATION: Early consolidation with brentuximab vedotin after autologous stem-cell transplantation improved progression-free survival in patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma with risk factors for relapse or progression after transplantation. This treatment provides an important therapeutic option for patients undergoing autologous stem-cell transplantation.

Sugammadex reverses rocuronium-induced NMB by encapsulation. It is well tolerated in Caucasian patients, providing rapid reversal of moderate (reappearance of T2) rocuronium-induced NMB. We investigated the efficacy and safety of sugammadex versus neostigmine in Korean patients.
METHODS: This randomized, safety assessor-blinded trial (NCT01050543) included Korean patients undergoing general anesthesia. Rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg was given prior to intubation with maintenance doses of 0.1-0.2 mg/kg as required. Patients received sugammadex 2.0 mg/kg or neostigmine 50 µg/kg with glycopyrrolate 10 µg/kg to reverse the NMB at the reappearance of T2, after the last rocuronium dose. The primary efficacy endpoint was the time from sugammadex or neostigmine administration to recovery of the train-of-four (TOF) ratio to 0.9. The safety of these medications was also assessed.
RESULTS: Of 128 randomized patients, 118 had evaluable data (n = 59 in each group). The geometric mean (95% confidence interval) time to recovery of the TOF ratio to 0.9 was 1.8 (1.6, 2.0) minutes in the sugammadex group and 14.8 (12.4, 17.6) minutes in the neostigmine group (P < 0.0001). Sugammadex was generally well tolerated, with no evidence of residual or recurrence of NMB; four patients in the neostigmine group reported adverse events possibly indicative of inadequate NMB reversal.

METHODS: c-Fos expression in sleep-promoting brain nuclei was assessed in rats using immunohistochemistry and hybridization. Next, the authors perturbed these pathways using (1) discrete lesions induced by ibotenic acid, (2) local and systemic administration of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor type A (GABA ) receptor antagonist gabazine, or (3) alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist atipamezole in rats, and (4) genetic mutation of the alpha -adrenoceptor in mice.
RESULTS: Dexmedetomidine induced a qualitatively similar pattern of c-Fos expression in rats as seen during normal NREM sleep, a decrease in the locus ceruleus (LC) and tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) and an increase in the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO). These changes were attenuated by atipamezole and were not seen in mice lacking functional alpha2a-adrenoceptors, which do not show a sedative response to dexmedetomidine. Bilateral VLPO lesions attenuated the sedative response to dexmedetomidine, and the dose-response curve to dexmedetomidine was shifted right by gabazine administered systemically or directly into the TMN. VLPO lesions and gabazine pretreatment altered c-Fos expression in the TMN but in not the LC after dexmedetomidine administration, indicating a hierarchical sequence of changes.
CONCLUSIONS: The authors propose that endogenous sleep pathways are causally involved in dexmedetomidine-induced sedation; dexmedetomidine's sedative mechanism involves inhibition of the LC, which disinhibits VLPO firing. The increased release of GABA at the terminals of the VLPO inhibits TMN firing, which is required for the sedative response.",2,PRIMARY,Time Required After Surgery to Reach Fitness for Discharge From Hospital,No Description Available,Dexmedetomidine,Saline,"At the beginning of spinal surgery, patients will receive 1 hour dexmedetomidine intravenous bolus of 0.7 mcg/kg, followed by infusion of dexmedetomidine at a rate of 0.5 mcg/kg/hour for 2 hours, followed by an infusion of dexmedetomidine at a rate of 0.2 mcg/kg/hour for the duration of the procedure and for 4 hours after the procedure.

However, data regarding the symptoms noted in DSM-IV and timing of their expression in the menstrual cycle have had little empirical support.
OBJECTIVE: To provide evidence informing the definitional criteria for PMDD.
DESIGN: Prospective surveys.
SETTING: General community and clinical settings.
PARTICIPANTS: Two cohorts that included a representative sample and a self-identified treatment-seeking cohort. Main Outcome Measure  Daily ratings of perimenstrual symptoms and functioning.
RESULTS: Mood and physical symptoms were most severe and were accompanied by impairment in the 4 days before through the first 2 days of menses for the self-identified group and in the 3 days before through the first 3 days of menses in the community sample. The most problematic symptoms endorsed were those listed in DSM-IV, but depressed mood was less frequent than other affective symptoms. In the combined sample, 4 or more symptoms was the optimal cutoff point for maximizing both sensitivity and specificity when predicting impairment.
CONCLUSIONS: This is informative for DSM-5 in that the most symptomatic period typically includes the few days before through the first 3 days of menses rather than only the premenstrual phase. Further, we validated the salience of PMDD symptoms included in DSM-IV.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of vitamin D3 1000 IU/d on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], PTH, and markers of bone turnover (osteocalcin and collagen type 1 cross-linked C-telopeptide) in black children and white children, and to explore whether there is a threshold level of 25(OH)D associated with maximal suppression of serum PTH concentration.
DESIGN: Healthy 8- to 14-year-old Pittsburgh-area black (n = 84) and white (n = 73) children not receiving vitamin supplements, enrolled from October through March from 2008 through 2011, were randomized to vitamin D3 1000 IU or placebo daily for 6 months.
RESULTS: The mean baseline concentration of 25(OH)D was <20 ng/mL in both the vitamin D-supplemented group and the placebo group (19.8 ± 7.6 and 18.8 ± 6.9 ng/mL, respectively). The mean concentration was higher in the supplemented group than in the placebo group at 2 months (26.4 ± 8.1 vs 18.9 ± 8.1 ng/mL; P < .0001) and also at 6 months (26.7 ± 7.6 vs 22.4 ± 7.3; P = .003), after adjusting for baseline 25(OH)D, race, gender, pubertal status, dietary vitamin D intake, body mass index, and sunlight exposure. Increases were only significant in black children, when examined by race. The association between 25(OH)D and PTH concentrations was inverse and linear, without evidence of a plateau. Overall, vitamin D supplementation had no effect on PTH and bone turnover.
CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D3 supplementation with 1000 IU/d in children with mean baseline 25(OH)D concentration <20 ng/mL effectively raised their mean 25(OH)D concentration to ≥20 ng/mL but failed to reach 30 ng/mL.

In this new era of HIV as a chronic disease, the continued success of ART will depend critically on sustained high ART adherence. The objective of this review was to systematically review interventions that can improve adherence to ART, including individual-level interventions and changes to the structure of ART delivery, to inform the evidence base for the 2013 WHO consolidated antiretroviral guidelines.
DESIGN: A rapid systematic review.
METHODS: We conducted a rapid systematic review of the global evidence on interventions to improve adherence to ART, utilizing pre-existing systematic reviews to identify relevant research evidence complemented by screening of databases for articles published over the past 2 years on evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We searched five databases for both systematic reviews and primary RCT studies (Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and WHO Global Health Library); we additionally searched ClinicalTrials.gov for RCT studies. We examined intervention effectiveness by different study characteristics, in particular, the specific populations who received the intervention.
RESULTS: A total of 124 studies met our selection criteria. Eighty-six studies were RCTs. More than 20 studies have tested the effectiveness of each of the following interventions, either singly or in combination with other interventions: cognitive-behavioural interventions, education, treatment supporters, directly observed therapy, and active adherence reminder devices (such as mobile phone text messages). Although there is strong evidence that all five of these interventions can significantly increase ART adherence in some settings, each intervention has also been found not to produce significant effects in several studies. Almost half (55) of the 124 studies investigated the effectiveness of combination interventions. Combination interventions tended to have effects that were similar to those of single interventions. The evidence base on interventions in key populations was weak, with the exception of interventions for people who inject drugs.
CONCLUSION: Tested and effective adherence-enhancing interventions should be increasingly moved into implementation in routine programme and care settings, accompanied by rigorous evaluation of implementation impact and performance. Major evidence gaps on adherence-enhancing interventions remain, in particular, on the cost-effectiveness of interventions in different settings, long-term effectiveness, and effectiveness of interventions in specific populations, such as pregnant and breastfeeding women.",2,PRIMARY,Continuous Adherence,Percentage of doses taken of those prescribed from electronic monitoring.

The phase III KEYNOTE-122 study was conducted to further evaluate pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy in patients with platinum-pretreated, recurrent and/or metastatic NPC. Final analysis results are presented.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: KEYNOTE-122 was an open-label, randomized study conducted at 29 sites, globally. Participants with platinum-pretreated recurrent and/or metastatic NPC were randomly assigned (1 : 1) to pembrolizumab or chemotherapy with capecitabine, gemcitabine, or docetaxel. Randomization was stratified by liver metastasis (present versus absent). The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), analyzed in the intention-to-treat population using the stratified log-rank test (superiority threshold, one-sided P = 0.0187). Safety was assessed in the as-treated population.
RESULTS: Between 5 May 2016 and 28 May 2018, 233 participants were randomly assigned to treatment (pembrolizumab, n = 117; chemotherapy, n = 116); Most participants (86.7%) received study treatment in the second-line or later setting.

The adverse events are preceded by acute worsening of oral glucose tolerance (oGTT) along with reduced plasma free fatty acids (FFA) and leptin in animal models. It is unclear whether the same acute effects occur in humans.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial was conducted to examine the potential metabolic effects of olanzapine in healthy volunteers. Participants included male (8) and female (7) subjects [18-30 years old, BMI 18.5-25]. Subjects received placebo or olanzapine (10 mg/day) for three days prior to oGTT testing. Primary endpoints included measurement of plasma leptin, oral glucose tolerance, and plasma free fatty acids (FFA). Secondary metabolic endpoints included: triglycerides, total cholesterol, high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, heart rate, blood pressure, body weight and BMI. Olanzapine increased glucose Area Under the Curve (AUC) by 42% (2808±474 vs. 3984±444 mg/dl·min; P = 0.0105) during an oGTT. Fasting plasma leptin and triglycerides were elevated 24% (Leptin: 6.8±1.3 vs. 8.4±1.7 ng/ml; P = 0.0203) and 22% (Triglycerides: 88.9±10.1 vs. 108.2±11.6 mg/dl; P = 0.0170), whereas FFA and HDL declined by 32% (FFA: 0.38±0.06 vs. 0.26±0.04 mM; P = 0.0166) and 11% (54.2±4.7 vs. 48.9±4.3 mg/dl; P = 0.0184), respectively after olanzapine. Other measures were unchanged.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Olanzapine exerts some but not all of the early endocrine/metabolic changes observed in rodent models of the metabolic side effects, and this suggest that antipsychotic effects are not limited to perturbations in glucose metabolism alone. Future prospective clinical studies should focus on identifying which reliable metabolic alterations might be useful as potential screening tools in assessing patient susceptibility to weight gain and diabetes caused by atypical antipsychotics.

METHODS: A randomized controlled trial compared contingent vouchers (CV) for smoking abstinence to noncontingent vouchers (NV), when all received counseling and NRT. Smokers who had not sought smoking treatment (n=340) in residential SUD treatment were provided 14days of vouchers for complete smoking abstinence per exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) after a 5-day smoking reduction period, or vouchers only for breath samples, plus brief advice (four sessions) and 8weeks of NRT.
RESULTS: Within treatment, 20% had complete abstinence with CV, 5% with NV (p<.001), and participants showed 50% of days abstinent in CV compared to 22% in NV (p<.001).

Approximately 3-10% of the population has an increased risk for colorectal cancer due to family history and warrants more frequent or intensive screening. Yet, < 50% of that high-risk population receives guideline-concordant care. Systematic collection of family health history and decision support may improve guideline-concordant screening for patients at increased risk of colorectal cancer. We seek to test the effectiveness of a web-based, systematic family health history collection tool and decision support platform (MeTree) to improve risk assessment and appropriate management of colorectal cancer risk among patients in the Department of Veterans Affairs primary care practices.
METHODS: In this ongoing randomized controlled trial, primary care providers at the Durham Veterans Affairs Health Care System and the Madison VA Medical Center are randomized to immediate intervention or wait-list control. Veterans are eligible if assigned to enrolled providers, have an upcoming primary care appointment, and have no conditions that would place them at increased risk for colorectal cancer (such as personal history, adenomatous polyps, or inflammatory bowel disease). Those with a recent lower endoscopy (e.g. colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy) are excluded. Immediate intervention patients put their family health history information into a web-based platform, MeTree, which provides both patient- and provider-facing decision support reports. Wait-list control patients access MeTree 12 months post-consent. The primary outcome is the risk-concordant colorectal cancer screening referral rate obtained via chart review. Secondary outcomes include patient completion of risk management recommendations (e.g. colonoscopy) and referral for genetic consultation. We will also conduct an economic analysis and an assessment of providers' experience with MeTree clinical decision support recommendations to inform future implementation efforts if the intervention is found to be effective.
DISCUSSION: This trial will assess the feasibility and effectiveness of patient-collected family health history linked to decision support to promote risk-appropriate screening in a large healthcare system such as the Department of Veterans Affairs.

The percentages of patients with clinical adverse events, laboratory adverse events, or discontinuation because of a laboratory adverse event were also similar between treatments. Alanine aminotransferase elevations ≥ 3x normal occurred in 0.6% of women on telcagepant and 0.4% on placebo. Three women on telcagepant vs none on placebo had alanine aminotransferase elevations ≥ 8× normal. In the efficacy subset there was no significant effect of telcagepant (n = 887) vs placebo (n = 447) in mean monthly headache days (treatment difference -0.5 day (95% CI: -1.1, 0.1)). However, telcagepant was associated with a reduction in on-drug headache days (treatment difference -0.4 day (95% CI: -0.5, -0.2), nominal p < 0.001).

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients were randomized to sorafenib (400 mg b.i.d.) or placebo, combined with mFOLFOX6 (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2); levo-leucovorin 200 mg/m(2); fluorouracil 400 mg/m(2) bolus and 2400 mg/m(2) continuous infusion) every 14 days. Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Target sample was 120 events in 180 patients for >85% power (two-sided α = 0.20) to detect an HR = 0.65.
RESULTS: Of 198 patients randomized, median PFS for sorafenib plus mFOLFOX6 was 9.1 months versus 8.7 months for placebo plus mFOLFOX6 (HR = 0.88; 95% CI, 0.64-1.23; P = 0.46).

Evidence suggests that group medical visits are effective for treating chronic pain; similarly, a number of studies demonstrate the effectiveness of certain evidence-based complementary therapies in managing pain.
OBJECTIVES: The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of the integrative medical group visit (IMGV) care model in an inner-city racially diverse outpatient clinic. IMGV combines patient-centered, non-pharmacologic strategies and principles of mindfulness-based stress-reduction with a group medical visit to reduce pain and associated symptoms.
METHODS: We surveyed patients pre and post an 8-session IMGV program to evaluate changes in pain in the last week (0-10 point scale) and comorbid symptoms including depression (Patient Health Questionaire-8 [PHQ-8]), perceived stress, and sleep quality. We also recorded referrals to the program, patients screened for eligibility, total enrollment, loss to follow-up, and attendance.
RESULTS: Seventy patients joined IMGV, and of these, 65 (93%) enrolled in the study. Over the course of 12 months, 7 groups met (median 9 patients/group; range 8-13 participants). Mean difference in pain level for all patients between baseline and 8 weeks was 0.7 (SD=2.0, P=.005). Mean difference in PHQ-8 depression score for patients with baseline score ≥5 was 2.6 (SD=4.6, P<.001). Statistically significant improvements were also seen in sleep quality and perceived stress.

BACKGROUND: Simvastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, reduced cardiovascular events in patients with myocardial infarction and hypercholesterolemia.
METHODS: Sixteen patients with polygenic hypercholesterolemia were randomly allocated to diet (n = 8) or diet plus 20 mg/day simvastatin (n = 8) for eight weeks. Before and at the end of treatment period, lipid profile and monocyte expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) were measured.
RESULTS: At baseline no difference in lipid profile and monocyte expression of TNF and IL-1beta were observed between the two groups. In patients allocated to diet alone, no change in lipid profile and monocyte expression of TNF and IL-1beta was seen. In patients with diet plus simvastatin, significant decreases of total cholesterol (-27%, p<0.02), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (-33%, p<0.02), and monocyte expression of TNF (-49%, p<0.02) and IL-1beta (-35%, p<0.02) were observed.

Yet there is no evidence that coffee improves insulin sensitivity and, at least in acute studies, caffeine has a negative impact in this regard. Thus, it is reasonable to suspect that coffee influences the risk for beta cell ""failure"" that precipitates diabetes in subjects who are already insulin resistant. Indeed, there is recent evidence that coffee increases production of the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), possibly owing to an inhibitory effect of chlorogenic acid (CGA -- the chief polyphenol in coffee) on glucose absorption. GLP-1 acts on beta cells, via cAMP-dependent mechanisms, to promote the synthesis and activity of the transcription factor IDX-1, crucial for maintaining the responsiveness of beta cells to an increase in plasma glucose. Conversely, the ""glucolipotoxicity"" thought to initiate and sustain beta cell dysfunction in diabetics can suppress expression of this transcription factor. The increased production of GLP-1 associated with frequent coffee consumption could thus be expected to counteract the adverse impact of chronic free fatty acid overexposure on beta cell function in overweight insulin resistant subjects. CGA's putative impact on glucose absorption may reflect the ability of this compound to inhibit glucose-6-phosphate translocase 1, now known to play a role in intestinal glucose transport. Delayed glucose absorption may itself protect beta cells by limiting postprandial hyperglycemia -- though, owing to countervailing effects of caffeine on plasma glucose, and a paucity of relevant research studies, it is still unclear whether coffee ingestion blunts the postprandial rise in plasma glucose. More generally, diets high in ""lente carbohydrate"", or administration of nutraceuticals/pharmaceuticals which slow the absorption of dietary carbohydrate, should help preserve efficient beta cell function by boosting GLP-1 production, as well as by blunting the glucotoxic impact of postprandial hyperglycemia on beta cell function.",2,PRIMARY,Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG),Reflect the fasting glucose level after a 10- to 12-h overnight fast.,Chlorogenic Acid,Placebo,"1200 mg dose per day, three capsules of 400 mg, times daily 1/ 2 hour before meals during 90 days.

DESIGN: Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study.
PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-eight patients completed the study, 35 patients in the placebo group and 33 patients in the CF101 group.
INTERVENTION: Patients were treated orally with either 1 mg CF101 pills or matching vehicle-filled placebo pills, given twice daily for 12 weeks, followed by a 2-week posttreatment observation.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: An improvement of more than 25% over baseline at week 12 in one of the following parameters: (1) tear break-up time (BUT); (2) superficial punctate keratitis assessed by fluorescein staining results; and (3) Schirmer tear test 1 results. Clinical laboratory safety tests, ophthalmic examinations, intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements, electrocardiographic evaluations, vital sign measurements, and monitoring of adverse events.
RESULTS: A statistically significant increase in the proportion of patients who achieved more than 25% improvement in the corneal staining and in the clearance of corneal staining was noted between the CF101-treated group and the placebo group. Treatment with CF101 resulted in a statistically significant improvement in the mean change from baseline at week 12 of the corneal staining, BUT, and tear meniscus (TM) height in the CF101-treated group. CF101 was well tolerated and exhibited an excellent safety profile with no serious adverse events. A statistically significant decrease from baseline was observed in the IOP of the CF101-treated group in comparison with the placebo group.
CONCLUSIONS: CF101, given orally, induced a statistically significant improvement in the corneal staining and an improvement in the BUT and TM in patients with moderate to severe dry eye syndrome. The drug was very well tolerated. These data and the anti-inflammatory characteristic of CF101 support further study of the drug as a potential treatment for the signs and symptoms of dry eye syndrome.

Since the usage profile of insulin therapy and pathologic features of Japanese patients differ from those of Caucasian patients, we determined the clinical benefit of such a combination therapy in Japanese patients.
METHODS: Patients who had inadequate glycemic control despite insulin, diet and exercise therapies were randomized into placebo (n = 70) and canagliflozin 100 mg (n = 76) groups that were administered once daily in addition to their prior insulin therapy in this double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The primary endpoint was the change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels from the baseline to week 16.
RESULTS: There was a statistically significant decrease in HbA1c levels from the baseline in the canagliflozin group (-0.97 ± 0.08 %) compared with the placebo group (0.13 ± 0.08 %) at week 16 [last observation carried forward (LOCF)]. The decrease in HbA1c levels in the canagliflozin group was independent of the insulin regimen (premixed, long-acting and long-acting plus rapid- or short-acting). Compared with the placebo group, canagliflozin significantly decreased fasting plasma glucose levels (-34.1 ± 4.8 vs -1.4 ± 5.0 mg/dL) and body weights (-2.13 ± 0.25 vs 0.24 ± 0.26 %), and significantly increased HDL cholesterol (3.3 ± 1.0 vs -0.5 ± 1.0 mg/dL) and HOMA2- %B (10.15 ± 1.37 vs 0.88 ± 1.42 %). The overall incidence of adverse events was similar between the two groups. The incidence and incidence per subject-year exposure of hypoglycemia (hypoglycemic symptoms and/or decreased blood glucose) were slightly higher in the canagliflozin group (40.0 % and 7.97) than in the placebo group (29.6 % and 4.51). However, hypoglycemic events in both groups were mild in severity and dose-reduction of insulin by <10 % from the baseline following hypoglycemic events decreased the incidence per subject-year exposure in the canagliflozin group. The incidence of hypoglycemia between the groups did not differ according to the insulin regimen.
CONCLUSION: Canagliflozin in combination with insulin was effective in improving glycemic control and reducing body weight and well tolerated by Japanese patients with T2DM.

DESIGN: Prospective follow-up study.
SETTING: Twenty-four Controlled High-Risk Subjects Avonex Multiple Sclerosis Prevention Study (CHAMPS) sites in the United States and Canada.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 81 patients originally randomly assigned to receive intramuscular interferon beta-1a (the immediate-treatment group) and 74 patients originally randomly assigned to receive placebo (the delayed-treatment group). All patients were from CHAMPS.
INTERVENTION: For the immediate-treatment group, treatment was initiated within a month after the onset of a clinically isolated syndrome, and for the delayed-treatment group, treatment was initiated a median of 30 months (interquartile range, 24-35 months) after CHAMPS randomization.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rate of developing clinically definite multiple sclerosis, annualized relapse rate, disease course classification, disability measures, and magnetic resonance imaging measures.
RESULTS: The immediate-treatment group showed a lower 10-year rate of clinically definite multiple sclerosis (unadjusted hazard ratio, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.48-0.87]; P = .004) and a lower annualized relapse rate between years 5 and 10 (P = .03).

Chinese patients present with prominent β-cell failure, with resulting deficiency in insulin secretion, particularly early phase insulin secretion leading to postprandial hyperglycemia. Sitagliptin, a selective once-daily oral dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, has been shown to improve glycemic control as monotherapy and in combination with other antihyperglycemic agents, including sulfonylureas and metformin.
METHODS: This was a multicenter randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study conducted in China. The study assessed the safety and efficacy of the addition of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily versus placebo on changes from baseline at Week 24 in HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 2-h post-meal glucose (PMG). Patients were aged 18-79 years, had T2DM with inadequate glycemic control, and were taking a sulfonylurea, with or without metformin.
RESULTS: After 24 weeks, sitagliptin reduced HbA1c, FPG, and 2-h PMG significantly more than placebo (between-treatment differences: -0.61 %, -16.8 mg/dL, and -32.9 mg/dL, respectively; P < 0.001 for all). The addition of sitagliptin was generally well tolerated, with a comparable incidence of adverse events and drug-related adverse events in both treatment groups.

RESULTS: We enrolled 52 subjects: 28 (54%) men, 32 (62%) with greater than or equal to 5 actual emergency bag-valve-mask situations. Median expired tidal volume percentage for 1-handed technique was 31% (95% confidence interval [CI] 17% to 51%); for 2-handed technique, 85% (95% CI 78% to 91%); and for modified 2-handed technique, 85% (95% CI 82% to 90%). Both 2-handed (median difference 47%; 95% CI 34% to 62%) and modified 2-handed technique (median difference 56%; 95% CI 29% to 65%) resulted in significantly higher median expired tidal volume percentages compared with 1-handed technique. The median expired tidal volume percentages between 2-handed and modified 2-handed techniques did not significantly differ from each other (median difference 0; 95% CI -2% to 2%).

DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled parallel-group trial.
SETTING: Acute in-patient, tertiary-care rehabilitation hospital.
PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sample of 17 in-patients with SCI <12 weeks before randomization; American Spinal Injury Association Impairment scale A, B, or C and medically stable. Twelve patients were evaluated at the primary endpoint at 6 months.
METHODS: Patients meeting study criteria were randomly assigned to zoledronic acid 5 mg or matching placebo. Dual x-ray absorptiometry scan and serum for bone markers (type 1 procollagen amino-terminal propeptide, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, collagen type 1 cross-linked C-telopeptide) were obtained at baseline and after 3 months, 6 months, and the every 6 months for up to 2 years.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary endpoint was change in bone mineral density (BMD) at the total hip after 6 months; secondary endpoints were changes in BMD at other skeletal sites and changes in levels of serum bone markers.
RESULTS: The group treated with zoledronic acid had a smaller decrease in BMD at 6 months at the total hip than the placebo group (right: -2.2 ± 3.4% versus -8.6 ± 3.5%, respectively, P = .03; left: -3.7 ± 1.0% versus -12.3 ± 6.9%, P = .03).

However, the precise type and dose of exercise needed to accrue health benefits is a contentious issue with no clear consensus recommendations for the prevention of inactivity-related disorders and chronic diseases. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that high-intensity interval training (HIT) can serve as an effective alternate to traditional endurance-based training, inducing similar or even superior physiological adaptations in healthy individuals and diseased populations, at least when compared on a matched-work basis. While less well studied, low-volume HIT can also stimulate physiological remodelling comparable to moderate-intensity continuous training despite a substantially lower time commitment and reduced total exercise volume. Such findings are important given that 'lack of time' remains the most commonly cited barrier to regular exercise participation. Here we review some of the mechanisms responsible for improved skeletal muscle metabolic control and changes in cardiovascular function in response to low-volume HIT. We also consider the limited evidence regarding the potential application of HIT to people with, or at risk for, cardiometabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes.

Because free clinic providers are often volunteers, it is unclear whether uninsured patients seeking care in these clinics receive evidence-based tobacco cessation support. Here we report baseline data on prevalence and correlates of tobacco use and provider cessation advice among a sample of uninsured patients at six free clinics.
METHODS: Patient exit interviews were conducted after a healthcare provider visit. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess correlates of tobacco use.
RESULTS: Of the 158 patients interviewed, 83 (53%) were tobacco users. Tobacco use was less likely among Hispanics (AOR 0.13 [95% CI 0.03-0.64]) and high school graduates (AOR=0.20 [95% CI 0.08-0.55]). Among tobacco users, 62% made at least one quit attempt in the past year and the majority were in the Contemplation (33%) or Preparation (39%) stage of readiness. 70% of all patients were screened in the past 3 months, although screening was more likely among tobacco users than nonusers (AOR 3.56 [95% CI 1.47-8.61]). At the current visit, 18% of tobacco users were advised to quit and 16% were asked if they were willing to quit.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of tobacco use among uninsured free clinic patients was more than twice the national average. There is substantial opportunity to increase tobacco screening among all patients and cessation advice among tobacco users.

We evaluated the effectiveness of HBV rapid testing in promoting linkage-to-care.
METHODS: In 2012, volunteers were recruited from five Parisian centers. Participants were randomized 1 : 1 to receive standard serology (S) or rapid testing (VIKIA-HBsAg/Quick Profile anti-HBsAb) with confirmatory serology (R+S). The primary endpoint was percentage of individuals with appropriate linkage-to-care (nonimmunized individuals starting vaccination or HBsAg-positive individuals receiving medical evaluation). The secondary outcomes were percentage receiving HBV-test results and performance of HBV rapid tests.
RESULTS: In total, 995 individuals were screened. Among the HBV-infection groups included in the primary endpoint (n=409), 20 (4.9%) received appropriate linkage-to-care, with no difference between S and R+S groups (5.7 vs. 4.1%, P=0.5). Two of eight HBsAg-positive participants had a medical visit (1/6 and 1/2 in the S and R+S groups, respectively) and 18/401 (4.5%) nonimmunized participants initiated HBV-vaccination (11/205 and 7/196). Factors that tended to be associated with linkage-to-care were female sex, birth country of high HBV prevalence, and extended medical stay. Test results were not obtained in 4.7% of participants, which was significantly higher in the S arm (P=0.02). Both sensitivity and specificity were 100% for the VIKIA-HBsAg rapid test and 94.4 and 80.8%, respectively, for the anti-HBsAb Quick Profile rapid test.
CONCLUSION: Despite a higher proportion of participants obtaining their results in the R+S arm and better performance of anti-HBsAb rapid tests than described previously, we found no evidence that HBV screening based initially on rapid tests leads to increased HBV-vaccination rates or medical evaluation.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The REDUCE study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled investigation of whether dutasteride (0.5 mg/day) reduced the risk of biopsy-detectable prostate cancer in men with a previous negative biopsy. The usefulness of PSA was evaluated using biopsy thresholds defined by National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines in the placebo group and any rise in PSA from nadir (the lowest PSA level achieved while in the study) in the dutasteride group. The number of cancers detected on biopsy in the absence of increased/suspicious PSA level as well as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for high grade prostate cancer detection were analysed by treatment group. Prostate cancer pathological characteristics were compared between men who did and did not meet biopsy thresholds.
RESULTS: Of 8231 men randomized, 3305 (dutasteride) and 3424 (placebo) underwent at least one prostate biopsy during the study and were included in the analysis. If only men meeting biopsy thresholds underwent biopsy, 25% (47/191) of Gleason 7 and 24% (7/29) of Gleason 8-10 cancers would have been missed in the dutasteride group, and 37% (78/209) of Gleason 7 and 22% (4/18) Gleason 8-10 cancers would have been missed in the placebo group. In both groups, the incidence of Gleason 7 and Gleason 8-10 cancers generally increased with greater rises in PSA. Sensitivity of PSA kinetics was higher and specificity was lower for the detection of Gleason 7-10 cancers in men treated with dutasteride vs placebo. Men with Gleason 7 and Gleason 8-10 cancer meeting biopsy thresholds had greater numbers of positive cores, percent core involvement, and biopsy cancer volume vs men not meeting thresholds.
CONCLUSION: Using treatment-specific biopsy thresholds, the present study shows that the ability of PSA kinetics to detect high grade prostate cancer is maintained with dutasteride compared with placebo in men with a previous negative biopsy. The sensitivity of PSA kinetics with dutasteride was similar to (Gleason 8-10) or higher than (Gleason 7-10) the placebo group; however, biopsy decisions based on a single increased PSA measurement from nadir in the dutasteride group resulted in a lower specificity compared with using a comparable biopsy threshold in the placebo group, indicating the importance of confirmation of PSA measurements.",2,PRIMARY,Number of Participants With Biopsy-detectable Prostate Cancer at Years 2 and 4 (Crude Rate Approach),"Study biopsies consisted of 10 biopsy samples (cores) in a pre-defined pattern.

Nicotine replacement (NRT) could improve outcomes previously observed with vouchers without NRT.
METHODS: A randomized controlled trial compared contingent vouchers (CV) for smoking abstinence to noncontingent vouchers (NV), when all received counseling and NRT. Smokers who had not sought smoking treatment (n=340) in residential SUD treatment were provided 14days of vouchers for complete smoking abstinence per exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) after a 5-day smoking reduction period, or vouchers only for breath samples, plus brief advice (four sessions) and 8weeks of NRT.
RESULTS: Within treatment, 20% had complete abstinence with CV, 5% with NV (p<.001), and participants showed 50% of days abstinent in CV compared to 22% in NV (p<.001). Across 1, 3, 6 and 12months after randomization, CV resulted in significantly fewer cigarettes per day (p<.01) and fewer days smoking (p<.01), but with small effects.

Poor transitional care is linked to unplanned health care reuse. We evaluated the effects of a pediatric transition intervention, specifically a single nurse home visit, on postdischarge outcomes in a randomized controlled trial.
METHODS: We randomly assigned 1500 children hospitalized on hospital medicine, neurology services, or neurosurgery services to receive either a single postdischarge nurse-led home visit or no visit. We excluded children discharged with skilled home nursing services. Primary outcomes included 30-day unplanned, urgent health care reuse (composite measure of unplanned readmission, emergency department, or urgent care visit). Secondary outcomes, measured at 14 days, included postdischarge parental coping, number of days until parent-reported return to normal routine, and number of ""red flags"" or clinical warning signs a parent or caregiver could recall.
RESULTS: The 30-day reuse rate was 17.8% in the intervention group and 14.0% in the control group. In the intention-to-treat analysis, children randomly assigned to the intervention group had higher odds of 30-day health care use (odds ratio: 1.33; 95% confidence interval: 1.003-1.76).

Rehabilitation regimens have been proposed to improve spinal stability via selective recruitment of certain trunk muscle groups. This biomechanical analytical study addressed whether lumbar spinal stability is increased by such selective activation.
METHODS: The biomechanical model included anatomically realistic three-layers of curved abdominal musculature, rectus abdominis and 77 symmetrical pairs of dorsal muscles. The muscle activations were calculated with the model loaded with either flexion, extension, lateral bending or axial rotation moments up to 60 Nm, along with intra-abdominal pressure up to 5 or 10 kPa (37.5 or 75 mm Hg) and partial bodyweight. After solving for muscle forces, a buckling analysis quantified spinal stability. Subsequently, different patterns of muscle activation were studied by forcing activation of selected abdominal muscles to at least 10% or 20% of maximum.
FINDINGS: Spinal stability increased by an average factor of 1.8 with doubling of intra-abdominal pressure. Forcing at least 10% activation of obliques or transversus abdominis muscles increased stability slightly for efforts other than flexion, but forcing at least 20% activation generally did not produce further increase in stability. Forced activation of rectus abdominis did not increase stability.
INTERPRETATION: Based on analytical predictions, the degree of stability was not substantially influenced by selective forcing of muscle activation. This casts doubt on the supposed mechanism of action of specific abdominal muscle exercise regimens that have been proposed for low back pain rehabilitation.",2,PRIMARY,Change From 11 Weeks to 6 Months in Numeric Pain Rating Scale (0-10 Points),Current Pain Scale 0-10 Lower score is better/improved; Negative value indicates improvement,Stabilization,Strengthening and Conditioning,"Stabilization exercise protocol: The stabilization exercise protocol consists of exercises focused on improving the ability of trunk muscles to stabilize the spine, beginning with training to isolate the deeper abdominal muscles as well as deep dorsal trunk muscles. Then patients were progressed to exercises that added leverage of the limbs while maintaining the co-contraction of the deeper abdominal muscles and deep dorsal trunk muscles while breathing normally. Various positions (e.g., supine and quadruped positions) were used to challenge the patients based on their tolerance. Finally, patients were progressed to exercises in more functional positions that included tasks/activities that were reported as challenging and/or painful; patients performed the tasks at the speed demanded by the particular task. Maintenance of the co-contraction of deep trunk muscles was emphasized during these functional activities.","Strength and conditioning exercise protocol: This protocol contained trunk strengthening and endurance exercises. It consisted of 3 phases: 1) initial strengthening of trunk flexors/extensors in single plane movements, 2) trunk and lower-extremity stretching as well as progression of trunk-strengthening exercises to include multi-planar trunk movements. Aerobic exercises were progressed as tolerated and patient education about body biomechanics were reinforced, and 3) trunk-strengthening exercises under dynamic conditions (e.g., unstable support surface and in multi-planar trunk movements). During the 10 week protocol, exercises became more challenging, and each subject had to complete at least the first phase before moving onto the next phase in order to be included in post-testing analyses.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A population-based, cross-sectional cohort study was conducted in women aged 20-45 years. Urogenital symptoms and quality of life were assessed using standardized questionnaires, e.g. the Urogenital Distress Inventory and Incontinence Impact Questionnaire.
RESULTS: The prevalence of symptoms of stress incontinence (39%), urge incontinence (15%) and an overactive bladder (12%) was high in this young population. Compared with urge incontinence, the symptoms of an overactive bladder similarly reduced the quality of life, but stress incontinence did not significantly affect the quality of life. Women with symptoms of an overactive bladder were especially limited in their mobility, whereas urge incontinence was especially associated with feelings of embarrassment.

Emphasis is given to the infant as an important, though often neglected, addressee. A clinical example is used in which a telephone call during a prior session triggered fretting in a 3-month-old girl and distress in her mother. It is suggested that in the session, nonverbal levels of the interventions reached the girl and contained her, and that this containment worked along similar lines as the communicative musicality between mother and baby. In the discussion, the psychoanalytic concept of containment (Bion, 1962) is linked with the concept of communicative musicality (Trevarthen & Aitken, 2001). The mother's need for containment also is emphasized, and the therapist must be on alert when it is essential to focus on either participant in the therapy room. This choice is guided both by explicit deliberations and by the unconscious countertransference. However, the therapist's wish to grasp the countertransference is countered by his or her unwillingness of being reminded of feelings of infantile helplessness. Similarly, when the mother's conscious and unconscious messages diverge, the baby's ability to receive her caretaking is compromised. In the article's clinical case, this happened when the mother tried to soothe her daughter while being preoccupied with anger at the therapist to an extent to which she was not fully aware.",2,PRIMARY,"the Ages and Stages Questionnaire: Social-Emotional, (ASQ:SE; Squires et al., 2002","Items are mostly rated on a 4-step scale, with 0,5,10 or 15 points per item, where 0 is most optimal.

Heating instead of burning tobacco reduces, or eliminates, the formation of harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHC) that are found in cigarette smoke. The Carbon-Heated Tobacco Product (CHTP), a heat-not-burn tobacco product, mimics the cigarette smoking ritual. This randomized, open-label, two-arm, parallel-group, short-term confinement study tested the hypothesis that the geometric means of the BoExp levels for subjects switching to CHTP 1.0 for 5 days are lower relative to those continuing to smoke cigarettes. Biomarkers of exposure (BoExp), including nicotine, urinary excretion of mutagenic constituents (Ames test), and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 activity, were measured in blood and/or 24-h urine samples during ad libitum product use. Nicotine exposure remained at similar levels in individuals using CHTP as in those continuing to smoke cigarettes. Switching to CHTP resulted in marked decreases in all other urinary BoExp (56-97%), carboxyhemoglobin (59%), urinary mutagenic constituents, and CYP1A2 activity compared with continued cigarette smoking.

METHODS: Patients with serum phenytoin levels greater than 30 mg/L upon presentation to the ED were recruited from two urban teaching hospitals. Patients enrolled were older than 18, nonpregnant, able to tolerate activated charcoal by mouth and able to give written consent. They were randomized to receive 50 g activated charcoal by mouth every 4 hours or no activated charcoal. They continued in the study until the patient was discharged or the serum level was <25 mg/L. Serum levels were drawn every 6 hours initially, then every 24 hours after the 1st day. The presence of gait abnormalities and nystagmus was recorded and mini-mental status exam (MMSE) scores were collected from each patient enrolled. Time to reach subtoxic levels was recorded;
RESULTS: Seventeen patients were enrolled in the study. Seven patients received MDAC, eight patients served as controls and two patients who were initially enrolled as controls inadvertently received one dose of activated charcoal and were excluded from the analysis. Both groups were comparable in age and all were male. The median time to reach a subtoxic level was 41.1 hours (range, 11.6-196) and 19.3 hours (range, 13-33) in the control and charcoal groups, respectively (p = 0.049).

Nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel and gemcitabine (nab-P/G) is an evidence-based treatment for patients with APC. This retrospective study investigated the safety and efficacy of nab-P/G in patients with APC and cholestatic hyperbilirubinaemia.
METHODS: We screened our prospective database for patients with APC treated with nab-P/G at total bilirubin levels of ≥1.2 mg/dl. Patients were assigned into three groups according to their bilirubin level (A: 1.2-3 mg/dl, B: >3-5 mg/dl, C: >5 mg/dl). Analyses with regard to safety and survival were performed.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine of 168 patients screened between Dec 2013 and Dec 2015 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Most patients (83%) were male; median age was 63 [41-79] years. Nab-P/G administrations in patients with an elevated bilirubin level (median, range) did not result in unexpected toxicities assessed by predefined (non-)haematological parameters. Median overall survival (mOS) for the whole group was 11.7 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.8-14.0) months; for A: 11.8 (95% CI: 6.5-16.5), B: 9.2 (95% CI: 1.1 - NA) months and C 11.8 (95% CI: 5.9-20.0] months (p = 0.843). Again, mOS from the first application of nab-P/G did not differ between the groups (p = 0.13).
CONCLUSION: Nab-P/G administrations in our pts with cholestatic hyperbilirubinaemia suffering from APC were feasible and safe with respect to individualised dose administrations.

METHODS: We performed a multicenter, randomized equivalence trial comparing outcomes with retropubic and transobturator midurethral slings in women with stress incontinence. The primary outcome was treatment success at 12 months according to both objective criteria (a negative stress test, a negative pad test, and no retreatment) and subjective criteria (self-reported absence of symptoms, no leakage episodes recorded, and no retreatment). The predetermined equivalence margin was +/-12 percentage points.
RESULTS: A total of 597 women were randomly assigned to a study group; 565 (94.6%) completed the 12-month assessment. The rates of objectively assessed treatment success were 80.8% in the retropubic-sling group and 77.7% in the transobturator-sling group (3.0 percentage-point difference; 95% confidence interval [CI], -3.6 to 9.6). The rates of subjectively assessed success were 62.2% and 55.8%, respectively (6.4 percentage-point difference; 95% CI, -1.6 to 14.3). The rates of voiding dysfunction requiring surgery were 2.7% in those who received retropubic slings and 0% in those who received transobturator slings (P=0.004), and the respective rates of neurologic symptoms were 4.0% and 9.4% (P=0.01). There were no significant differences between groups in postoperative urge incontinence, satisfaction with the results of the procedure, or quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: The 12-month rates of objectively assessed success of treatment for stress incontinence with the retropubic and transobturator approaches met the prespecified criteria for equivalence; the rates of subjectively assessed success were similar between groups but did not meet the criteria for equivalence.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Adults (aged ≥18 years) from the southeastern United States with hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] ≥8% were randomized to TACM or usual care. Evidence-based guidelines were used to develop medication titration algorithms in conjunction with clinic physicians. Participants were given a telehealth device that uploaded blood glucose and blood pressure readings daily to a central server. A nurse case manager was trained on the algorithms and authorized to titrate medications every 2 weeks based on the algorithm under the supervision of an internist and an endocrinologist. Participants were assessed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. The primary outcome was HbA1c at 6-months postrandomization in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population.
RESULTS: One hundred thirteen participants were randomized to either TACM intervention or usual care. Based on ITT population after multiple imputation, the analysis of covariance with baseline HbA1c as covariate showed that HbA1c at 6 months for TACM was significantly lower compared to the usual care group (-0. 99, P = 0.024). Moreover, longitudinal mixed effects analysis suggested that the rate of decline in HbA1c over time for TACM was significantly faster compared to the usual care group (-0.16, P = 0.038). Results based on per-protocol population were similar.

Clearly a model that is applicable only to patients in need of intensive intervention, the advantages includes accurate data transfer to a medical decision maker and positive reinforcement/feedback to the patient via the FORA system to enhance adherence. If the case manager has physician-supervised prescriptive authority, then medication adjustments can be made daily or weekly, if needed, to achieve and maintain control. More frequent interventions, combined with improved compliance with medications and testing frequency, the strategies that are known to work, are enabled by this approach.

Using a consensus process, a panel of experts convened in 2011 (an initiative of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine endorsed by the American Thoracic Society and the Society of Critical Care Medicine) developed the Berlin Definition, focusing on feasibility, reliability, validity, and objective evaluation of its performance. A draft definition proposed 3 mutually exclusive categories of ARDS based on degree of hypoxemia: mild (200 mm Hg &lt; PaO2/FIO2 ≤ 300 mm Hg), moderate (100 mm Hg &lt; PaO2/FIO2 ≤ 200 mm Hg), and severe (PaO2/FIO2 ≤ 100 mm Hg) and 4 ancillary variables for severe ARDS: radiographic severity, respiratory system compliance (≤40 mL/cm H2O), positive end-expiratory pressure (≥10 cm H2O), and corrected expired volume per minute (≥10 L/min). The draft Berlin Definition was empirically evaluated using patient-level meta-analysis of 4188 patients with ARDS from 4 multicenter clinical data sets and 269 patients with ARDS from 3 single-center data sets containing physiologic information. The 4 ancillary variables did not contribute to the predictive validity of severe ARDS for mortality and were removed from the definition. Using the Berlin Definition, stages of mild, moderate, and severe ARDS were associated with increased mortality (27%; 95% CI, 24%-30%; 32%; 95% CI, 29%-34%; and 45%; 95% CI, 42%-48%, respectively; P &lt; .001) and increased median duration of mechanical ventilation in survivors (5 days; interquartile [IQR], 2-11; 7 days; IQR, 4-14; and 9 days; IQR, 5-17, respectively; P &lt; .001). Compared with the AECC definition, the final Berlin Definition had better predictive validity for mortality, with an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.577 (95% CI, 0.561-0.593) vs 0.536 (95% CI, 0.520-0.553; P &lt; .001).

Accurate identification of the puncture site is crucial for successful CSE block. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of ultrasound imaging on the success rate of CSE puncture in obese parturients.
METHODS: Sixty obese parturients with a body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m(2) who were scheduled for caesarean section were randomized into two equal-sized groups for location of the puncture site: an ultrasound group and a palpation group. The success rate of puncture at the first puncture site, the number of puncture attempts, duration of CSE procedure, time taken to determine the puncture site, and the depth of the epidural space were compared between groups. The frequencies of complications such as puncture site hemorrhage, neurological damage, and inadvertent dural puncture were also studied.
RESULTS: There were no differences in age, body weight, height, body mass index, or gestational age between the two groups. The success rate of puncture at the first puncture site was significantly higher in the ultrasound group than the palpation group (100.00% vs. 70.00%, P = 0.004). The number of puncture attempts was significantly lower in the ultrasound group than the palpation group (χ(2) = 6.708, P = 0.035). The time taken for determining the puncture site was (0.30 ± 0.12) minutes in the palpation group and (2.60 ± 0.61) minutes in the ultrasound group (P < 0.001). The duration of CSE procedure was (7.67 ± 1.52) minutes in the palpation group and (9.37 ± 1.35) minutes in the ultrasound group (P < 0.001). The depth of the epidural space was similar in both groups (P = 0.586). Puncture site hemorrhage was observed in 6 (20.00%) patients in the palpation group and 2 (6.67%) patients in the ultrasound group (P = 0.255).

To be truly collaborative, dissemination should involve community members in a two-way dialogue about new research findings. Yet little literature describes how to engage communities in dialogue about research findings, especially with historically marginalized communities where mistrust of researchers may exist because of past or present social injustices. Through a series of interactive community presentations on findings from a longitudinal study, we developed a process for community dissemination that involved several overlapping phases: planning, outreach, content development, interactive presentations, and follow-up. Through this process, we built on existing and new community relationships. Following each interactive presentation, the research team debriefed and reviewed notes to identify lessons learned from the process. Key themes included the importance of creating a flexible dissemination plan, tailoring presentations to each community group, establishing a point person to serve as a community liaison, and continuing dialogue with community members after the presentations. Core strategies for developing trust during dissemination included engaging community members at every step, reserving ample time for discussion during presentations, building rapport by sharing personal experiences, being receptive to and learning from criticism, and implementing input from community members.

Continuous monitoring of jugular bulb venous oxygen saturation (SvjO2) may help in the anesthetic management of such procedures.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fiberoptic SvjO2 was continuously monitored in seven patients during intracranial aneurysm surgery. Fiberoptic SvjO2 measurement was compared with IL3 CO-OXIMETER determination from 85 paired samples. The occurrence of large SvjO2 variations (SvjO2 variation reaching 10% or more of stable preceding value) during aneurysm surgery was recorded and classified according to the association or not with systemic clinical or therapeutic changes.
RESULTS: Fiberoptic SvjO2 showed a limited accuracy, with limits of agreement with IL3 CO-OXIMETER at -16.8% and +10.7% and a small bias (-3.1%). SvjO2 variations were frequent during aneurysm surgery, ranging from 3 to 22 per patient during procedures lasting 6 hours (range 4.5 to 7). Half of these variations occurred in the absence of any systemic clinical or therapeutic change, most often leading to an increased SvjO2.

Desmopressin significantly reduced the mean number of nocturnal voids and increased the odds of a 33% or greater response compared to placebo during 3 months, assessed by longitudinal analysis (-0.22, p = 0.028 and OR 1.85, p = 0.006, respectively). Desmopressin increased the mean time to first nocturnal void by 49 minutes compared to placebo at 3 months (p = 0.003). The response to desmopressin was seen by week 1 of treatment and was sustained throughout the trial. Significant increases in health related quality of life and sleep quality were observed compared to placebo. Desmopressin was well tolerated. Serum sodium levels remained greater than 125 mmol/L throughout the trial and 3 transient decreases to less than 130 mmol/L were recorded.

METHODS: In a randomised, open-label study, 121 healthy women, 18-50 years of age, were randomly assigned to receive NOMAC/E2 (2.5 mg/1.5 mg) in a 24/4-day regimen (n=60) or LNG/EE (150 μg/30 μg) in a 21/7-day regimen (n=61) for six cycles. The primary outcome was the change from baseline to cycle 6 for all indices.
RESULTS: All parameters were similar at baseline between the two groups. Over six cycles, NOMAC/E2 had less effect on most haemostatic indices than LNG/EE. Lipids were essentially unchanged with NOMAC/E2, whereas with LNG/EE high-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides slightly increased. NOMAC/E2 induced negligible changes in glucose and insulin parameters, in contrast to LNG/EE. A much smaller increase in CRP was observed with NOMAC/E2 than with LNG/EE.

Current etiologic theories suggest that ADHD stems from abnormalities in dopaminergic and possibly noradrenergic brainstem nuclei that act to regulate a cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical network, believed to be critical for executive functions and the regulation of behavioral responses such as arousal, attention, and inhibition. Noninvasive structural and functional neuroimaging techniques provide a new avenue for exploring the validity of these theories. Despite their limitations, neuroimaging studies have provided a unique and otherwise inaccessible, biological perspective of ADHD.

OBJECTIVE: To assess inhibition of interleukins 4 and 13 with dupilumab in patients with chronic sinusitis and nasal polyposis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group study conducted at 13 sites in the United States and Europe between August 2013 and August 2014 in 60 adults with chronic sinusitis and nasal polyposis refractory to intranasal corticosteroids with 16 weeks of follow-up.
INTERVENTIONS: Subcutaneous dupilumab (a 600 mg loading dose followed by 300 mg weekly; n = 30) or placebo (n = 30) plus mometasone furoate nasal spray for 16 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Change in endoscopic nasal polyp score (range, 0-8; higher scores indicate worse status) at 16 weeks (primary end point). Secondary end points included Lund-Mackay computed tomography (CT) score (range, 0-24; higher scores indicate worse status), 22-item SinoNasal Outcome Test score (range, 0-110; higher scores indicating worse quality of life; minimal clinically important difference ≥8.90), sense of smell assessed using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) score (range, 0-40; higher scores indicate better status), symptoms, and safety.
RESULTS: Among the 60 patients who were randomized (mean [SD] age, 48.4 years [9.4 years]; 34 men [56.7%]; 35 with comorbid asthma), 51 completed the study. The least squares (LS) mean change in nasal polyp score was -0.3 (95% CI, -1.0 to 0.4) with placebo and -1.9 (95% CI, -2.5 to -1.2) with dupilumab (LS mean difference, -1.6 [95% CI, -2.4 to -0.7]; P < .001). The LS mean difference between the 2 groups for the Lund-Mackay CT total score was -8.8 (95% CI, -11.1 to -6.6; P < .001). Significant improvements with dupilumab were also observed for the 22-item SinoNasal Outcome Test (LS mean difference between groups, -18.1 [95% CI, -25.6 to -10.6]; P < .001) and sense of smell assessed by UPSIT (LS mean difference, 14.8 [95% CI, 10.9 to 18.7]; P < .001). The most common adverse events were nasopharyngitis (33% in the placebo group vs 47% in the dupilumab group), injection site reactions (7% vs 40%, respectively), and headache (17% vs 20%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among adults with symptomatic chronic sinusitis and nasal polyposis refractory to intranasal corticosteroids, the addition of subcutaneous dupilumab to mometasone furoate nasal spray compared with mometasone alone reduced endoscopic nasal polyp burden after 16 weeks.

What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is commonly used as a primary treatment for patients with prostate cancer (PCa) who are not eligible for radical treatment options. ADT is also used in patients with PCa as neo-adjuvant hormone therapy to reduce prostate volume and down-stage the disease before radiotherapy with curative intent. The present study showed that ADT with the gonadotropin hormone-releasing hormone (GhRH) antagonist degarelix is non-inferior to combined treatment with the LHRH agonist goserelin and bicalutamide in terms of reducing prostate volume during the treatment period of 3 months. Degarelix treatment evokes, however, significantly better relief of lower urinary tract symptoms in patients having moderate and severe voiding problems.
OBJECTIVE: • To assess the efficacy of monthly degarelix treatment for reduction of total prostate volume (TPV), relief of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and improvement of quality of life (QoL) in patients with prostate cancer (PCa) using monthly goserelin as active control.
METHODS: • This was a randomized, parallel-arm, active-controlled, open-label, multicentre trial on 182 patients treated with either monthly degarelix (240/80 mg) or goserelin (3.6 mg) for 12 weeks. • For flare protection, goserelin-treated patients also received daily bicalutamide (50 mg) during the initial 28 days. • Key trial variables monitored monthly were TPV (primary endpoint), serum testosterone, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and the Benign Prostate Hyperplasia Impact Index.
RESULTS: • In all, 175 patients completed the trial (96.1%). • At week 12, changes in TPV for degarelix and goserelin were similar (-37.2% vs -39.0%) and met the predefined non-inferiority criterion. • Decreases in IPSS were greater in degarelix than in goserelin-treated patients, differences being statistically significant in patients with baseline IPSS > 13 (-6.7 ± 1.8 vs -4.0 ± 1.0; P = 0.02). • The number of patients with an IPSS change of ≥ 3 over baseline was also significantly higher in patients treated with degarelix (61.0 vs 44.3%, P = 0.02). • Both treatments were safe and well tolerated.
CONCLUSIONS: • Medical castration reduces TPV and could also improve LUTS in patients with PCa. • While the short-term efficacy of degarelix and goserelin + bicalutamide was the same in terms of TPV reduction, degarelix showed superiority in LUTS relief in symptomatic patients, which could highlight the different actions of these drugs on extrapituitary gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptors in the bladder and/or the prostate.",0,PRIMARY,Change From Baseline in Prostate Size Based on Trans Rectal Ultra Sound (TRUS) at Week 12 (Full Analysis Set),TRUS is a method of measuring the size of the prostate.,Degarelix 240 mg/80 mg,Goserelin (3.6 mg) + Bicalutamide (50 mg),"The degarelix doses were administered into the abdominal wall every 28 days.

We compared a newer LVAD design (a small intrapericardial centrifugal-flow device) against existing technology (a commercially available axial-flow device) in patients with advanced heart failure who were ineligible for heart transplantation.
METHODS: We conducted a multicenter randomized trial involving 446 patients who were assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, to the study (centrifugal-flow) device or the control (axial-flow) device. Adults who met contemporary criteria for LVAD implantation for permanent use were eligible to participate in the trial. The primary end point was survival at 2 years free from disabling stroke or device removal for malfunction or failure. The trial was powered to show noninferiority with a margin of 15 percentage points.
RESULTS: The intention-to treat-population included 297 participants assigned to the study device and 148 participants assigned to the control device. The primary end point was achieved in 164 patients in the study group and 85 patients in the control group. The analysis of the primary end point showed noninferiority of the study device relative to the control device (estimated success rates, 55.4% and 59.1%, respectively, calculated by the Weibull model; absolute difference, 3.7 percentage points; 95% upper confidence limit, 12.56 percentage points; P=0.01 for noninferiority).

METHODS: We searched 9 relevant electronic databases for randomized, controlled trials (RCTs). Two reviewers selected studies against inclusion criteria and assessed their quality. We classified RCTs according to type of course delivery (group, individual, mixed or remote), tutor (healthcare professional, lay or mixed), setting (medical, community or occupational), duration (more or less than 8 weeks), and the number and type of components (psychological, lifestyle, pain education, mind body therapies, and physical activity).

However, an antiviral treatment to control JCV is needed when immune reconstitution is delayed or not possible. On the basis of in vitro efficacy, this study evaluated the effect of mefloquine on PML and factors that may predict PML outcomes. This 38-week, open-label, randomized, parallel-group, proof-of-concept study compared patients with PML who received standard of care (SOC) with those who received SOC plus mefloquine (250 mg for 3 days, then 250 mg weekly). Patients randomized to SOC could add mefloquine treatment at week 4. The primary endpoint was change from baseline to weeks 4 and 8 in JCV DNA copy number (load) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Exploratory analyses evaluated factors that might correlate with clinical outcome. The majority of enrolled patients were HIV positive. Preplanned interim data analyses suggested that the study was unlikely to successfully demonstrate a significant difference between groups; therefore, the study was terminated prematurely.

DESIGN: A 3 x 2 factorial design was used with the primary randomization assigning patients (1: 1: 1) to one of two adherence interventions or usual care.
METHODS: The five-session adherence interventions consisted of cognitive-behavioral and motivational components, with or without a 2-week pre-treatment placebo practice trial. Intent-to-treat analysis used probability weights and regression tree analysis to account for missing data.
RESULTS: A total of 230 patients were randomized; 199 started ART, of whom 74% completed the 48-week study. Electronic monitored adherence outcomes between the two intervention groups did not differ significantly and were thus pooled in analyses. At week 4, 82% of intervention patients had taken at least 90% of their prescribed ART doses, compared with 65% of controls (P < 0.01); this group difference dropped to 12% at week 12 (72 versus 60%; P = 0.15) and 11% at week 24 (66 versus 55%; P = 0.28).

AD is pathologically characterized by extracellular deposits of beta-amyloid (Aβ) peptide, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau, neuronal loss, and neurotransmitter dysfunction. Clinically, AD is characterized by progressive cognitive decline that usually starts with memory impairment and progresses to cause a more generalized cognitive dysfunction, behavioral dysregulation, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. These symptoms collectively lead to a progressive and relentless decline in the ability to perform functions of daily living, eventually leading to total incapacitation. The incidence and prevalence of AD are expected to exponentially increase with the aging of the population. Currently approved treatments, including the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine, and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist memantine, do not halt the progression of the disease, and have provided marginal therapeutic benefits. Accordingly, there is an urgent need to develop novel and effective medications for AD that go beyond AChEIs and NMDA antagonists. Modern research has focused on discovering effective disease-modifying therapies, which specifically target the pathophysiologic cascade, hoping to delay the onset of the disease and slow its progression.

This study sought to assess differences in hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits among older adults using telemonitoring vs usual care.
METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was performed among adults older than 60 years at high risk for rehospitalization. Participants were randomized to telemonitoring (with daily input) or to patient-driven usual care. Telemonitoring was accomplished by daily biometrics,symptom reporting, and videoconference. The primary outcome was a composite end point of hospitalizations and ED visits in the 12 months following enrollment. Secondary end points included hospitalizations,ED visits, and total hospital days. Intent-to-treat analysis was performed.
RESULTS: Two hundred five participants were enrolled,with a mean age of 80.3 years.

However, data regarding the symptoms noted in DSM-IV and timing of their expression in the menstrual cycle have had little empirical support.
OBJECTIVE: To provide evidence informing the definitional criteria for PMDD.
DESIGN: Prospective surveys.
SETTING: General community and clinical settings.
PARTICIPANTS: Two cohorts that included a representative sample and a self-identified treatment-seeking cohort. Main Outcome Measure  Daily ratings of perimenstrual symptoms and functioning.
RESULTS: Mood and physical symptoms were most severe and were accompanied by impairment in the 4 days before through the first 2 days of menses for the self-identified group and in the 3 days before through the first 3 days of menses in the community sample. The most problematic symptoms endorsed were those listed in DSM-IV, but depressed mood was less frequent than other affective symptoms. In the combined sample, 4 or more symptoms was the optimal cutoff point for maximizing both sensitivity and specificity when predicting impairment.
CONCLUSIONS: This is informative for DSM-5 in that the most symptomatic period typically includes the few days before through the first 3 days of menses rather than only the premenstrual phase.

We assessed the efficacy of early treatment with glatiramer acetate in delaying onset of clinically definite multiple sclerosis.
METHODS: In this randomised, double-blind trial, undertaken in 80 sites in 16 countries, 481 patients presenting with a clinically isolated syndrome with unifocal manifestation, and two or more T2-weighted brain lesions measuring 6 mm or more, were randomly assigned to receive either subcutaneous glatiramer acetate 20 mg per day (n=243) or placebo (n=238) for up to 36 months, unless they converted to clinically definite multiple sclerosis. The randomisation scheme used SAS-based blocks stratified by centre, and patients and all personnel were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was time to clinically definite multiple sclerosis, based on a second clinical attack. Analysis was by intention to treat. A preplanned interim analysis was done for data accumulated from 81% of the 3-year study exposure. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00666224.
FINDINGS: All randomly assigned participants were analysed for the primary outcome. Glatiramer acetate reduced the risk of developing clinically definite multiple sclerosis by 45% compared with placebo (hazard ratio 0.55, 95% CI 0.40-0.77; p=0.0005).

The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to determine if a patient-centered deprescribing intervention initiated in the hospital and continued in the PAC setting reduces the total number of medications among older patients.
METHODS: The Shed-MEDS study is a 5-year, randomized controlled clinical intervention trial comparing a patient-centered describing intervention with usual care among older (≥50 years) hospitalized patients discharged to PAC, either a skilled nursing facility (SNF) or an inpatient rehabilitation facility (IPR). Patient measurements occur at hospital enrollment, hospital discharge, within 7 days of PAC discharge, and at 60 and 90 days following PAC discharge. Patients are randomized in a permuted block fashion, with block sizes of two to four. The overall effectiveness of the intervention will be evaluated using total medication count as the primary outcome measure. We estimate that 576 patients will enroll in the study. Following attrition due to death or loss to follow-up, 420 patients will contribute measurements at 90 days, which provides 90% power to detect a 30% versus 25% reduction in total medications with an alpha error of 0.05. Secondary outcomes include the number of medications associated with geriatric syndromes, drug burden index, medication adherence, the prevalence and severity of geriatric syndromes and functional health status.
DISCUSSION: The Shed-MEDS trial aims to test the hypothesis that a patient-centered deprescribing intervention initiated in the hospital and continuing through the PAC stay will reduce the total number of medications 90 days following PAC discharge and result in improvements in geriatric syndromes and functional health status. The results of this trial will quantify the health outcomes associated with reducing medications for hospitalized older adults with polypharmacy who are discharged to post-acute care facilities.

METHODS: In this double-blind, parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we enrolled adolescents (12 to <18 years of age) with obesity (a body-mass index [BMI] in the 95th percentile or higher) or with overweight (a BMI in the 85th percentile or higher) and at least one weight-related coexisting condition. Participants were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide (at a dose of 2.4 mg) or placebo for 68 weeks, plus lifestyle intervention. The primary end point was the percentage change in BMI from baseline to week 68; the secondary confirmatory end point was weight loss of at least 5% at week 68.
RESULTS: A total of 201 participants underwent randomization, and 180 (90%) completed treatment. All but one of the participants had obesity. The mean change in BMI from baseline to week 68 was -16.1% with semaglutide and 0.6% with placebo (estimated difference, -16.7 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -20.3 to -13.2; P<0.001). At week 68, a total of 95 of 131 participants (73%) in the semaglutide group had weight loss of 5% or more, as compared with 11 of 62 participants (18%) in the placebo group (estimated odds ratio, 14.0; 95% CI, 6.3 to 31.0; P<0.001). Reductions in body weight and improvement with respect to cardiometabolic risk factors (waist circumference and levels of glycated hemoglobin, lipids [except high-density lipoprotein cholesterol], and alanine aminotransferase) were greater with semaglutide than with placebo. The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events was greater with semaglutide than with placebo (62% vs. 42%). Five participants (4%) in the semaglutide group and no participants in the placebo group had cholelithiasis. Serious adverse events were reported in 15 of 133 participants (11%) in the semaglutide group and in 6 of 67 participants (9%) in the placebo group.

In this study, we compared a reduction treatment approach with an immediate cessation approach in a population of ST users who reported no immediate plans to quit.
METHODS: Subjects randomly assigned to the immediate cessation condition set a quit date soon after enrollment and were offered 2 weeks of nicotine patch therapy to help in their cessation efforts. Subjects assigned to the ST reduction group were provided with their choice of either 4 mg nicotine lozenge or ST brand switching to help them reduce their ST use or levels of nicotine exposure, respectively. Quit date was 6 weeks after the onset of treatment. Follow-up was at 12 weeks and 26 weeks postenrollment and 26 weeks postquit.
RESULTS: Both 7-day point prevalence abstinence and prolonged abstinence rates following the quit date were significantly higher in the immediate cessation group versus the reduction group at 12 and 26 weeks (all p values ≤ .04) and for prolonged abstinence at 6 months postquit (p = .002). Significant reductions in ST use among nonquitters were observed for both groups (p < .0001) with no differences between groups.

Continuous monitoring of jugular bulb venous oxygen saturation (SvjO2) may help in the anesthetic management of such procedures.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fiberoptic SvjO2 was continuously monitored in seven patients during intracranial aneurysm surgery. Fiberoptic SvjO2 measurement was compared with IL3 CO-OXIMETER determination from 85 paired samples. The occurrence of large SvjO2 variations (SvjO2 variation reaching 10% or more of stable preceding value) during aneurysm surgery was recorded and classified according to the association or not with systemic clinical or therapeutic changes.
RESULTS: Fiberoptic SvjO2 showed a limited accuracy, with limits of agreement with IL3 CO-OXIMETER at -16.8% and +10.7% and a small bias (-3.1%). SvjO2 variations were frequent during aneurysm surgery, ranging from 3 to 22 per patient during procedures lasting 6 hours (range 4.5 to 7). Half of these variations occurred in the absence of any systemic clinical or therapeutic change, most often leading to an increased SvjO2.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the accuracy of fiberoptic SvjO2 determination is limited, it allows the detection of cerebral blood flow and oxygen supply-demand imbalance during aneurysm surgery.

Disturbed sleep can be found in 30-80% of schizophrenic patients, depending on the degree of psychotic symptomatology. Measured by polysomnography, reduced sleep efficiency and total sleep time, as well as increased sleep latency, are found in most patients with schizophrenia and appear to be an important part of the pathophysiology of this disorder. Some studies also reported alterations of stage 2 sleep, slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep variables, i.e. reduced REM latency and REM density. A number of sleep parameters, such as the amount of SWS and the REM latency, are significantly correlated to clinical variables, including severity of illness, positive symptoms, negative symptoms, outcome, neurocognitive impairment and brain structure.Concerning specific sleep disorders, there is some evidence that schizophrenic patients carry a higher risk of experiencing a sleep-related breathing disorder, especially those demonstrating the known risk factors, including being overweight but also long-term use of antipsychotics. However, it is still unclear whether periodic leg movements in sleep or restless legs syndrome (RLS) are found with a higher or lower prevalence in schizophrenic patients than in healthy controls.There are no consistent effects of first-generation antipsychotics on measures of sleep continuity and sleep structure, including the percentage of sleep stages or sleep and REM latency in healthy controls. In contrast to first-generation antipsychotics, the studied atypical antipsychotics (clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, ziprasidone and paliperidone) demonstrate a relatively consistent effect on measures of sleep continuity, with an increase in either total sleep time (TST) or sleep efficiency, and individually varying effects on other sleep parameters, such as an increase in REM latency observed for olanzapine, quetiapine and ziprasidone, and an increase in SWS documented for olanzapine and ziprasidone in healthy subjects.The treatment of schizophrenic patients with first-generation antipsychotics is consistently associated with an increase in TST and sleep efficiency, and mostly an increase in REM latency, whereas the influence on specific sleep stages is more variable. On the other hand, withdrawal of such treatment is followed by a change in sleep structure mainly in the opposite direction, indicating a deterioration of sleep quality. On the background of the rather inconsistent effects of first-generation antipsychotics observed in healthy subjects, it appears possible that the high-potency drugs exert their effects on sleep in schizophrenic patients, for the most part, in an indirect way by suppressing stressful psychotic symptomatology. In contrast, the available data concerning second-generation antipsychotics (clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone and paliperidone) demonstrate a relatively consistent effect on measures of sleep continuity in patients and healthy subjects, with an increase in TST and sleep efficiency or a decrease in wakefulness. Additionally, clozapine and olanzapine demonstrate comparable influences on other sleep variables, such as SWS or REM density, in controls and schizophrenic patients. Possibly, the effects of second-generation antipsychotics observed on sleep in healthy subjects and schizophrenic patients might involve the action of these drugs on symptomatology, such as depression, cognitive impairment, and negative and positive symptoms.Specific sleep disorders, such as RLS, sleep-related breathing disorders, night-eating syndrome, somnambulism and rhythm disorders have been described as possible adverse effects of antipsychotics and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of disturbed or unrestful sleep in this population.",2,PRIMARY,Insomnia Severity Index (ISI),"ISI score; scored on a scale of 0 to 28, with higher scores indicating worse insomnia severity.",Cognitive Behavioral Therapy-Insomnia,Health and Wellness,"Cognitive Behavioral Therapy-Insomnia: CBT-I addresses cognitive, arousal and behavioral factors related to sleep difficulties.

METHODS: Participants who were referred to outpatient physical therapy for dizziness were randomly assigned to the gaze stabilization (GS) group (n = 20) or control (CON) group (n = 19). Dizziness was defined as symptoms of unsteadiness, spinning, a sense of movement, or lightheadedness. Participants were evaluated at baseline and discharge on symptoms, balance confidence, visual acuity during head movement, balance, and gait measures. The GS group performed vestibular adaptation and substitution exercises designed to improve gaze stability, and the CON group performed placebo eye exercises designed to be vestibular neutral. In addition, both groups performed balance and gait exercises.
RESULTS: There were no baseline differences (P > .05) between the GS and CON groups in age, sex, affect, physical activity level, or any outcome measures. Both groups improved significantly in all outcome measures with the exception of perceived disequilibrium. However, there was a significant interaction for fall risk as measured by Dynamic Gait Index (P = .026) such that the GS group demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in fall risk compared with the CON group (90% of the GS group demonstrated a clinically significant improvement in fall risk versus 50% of the CON group).

Whether this latter property affects clinical outcomes is unknown.
METHODS: We evaluated relationships between the LDL cholesterol and CRP levels achieved after treatment with 80 mg of atorvastatin or 40 mg of pravastatin per day and the risk of recurrent myocardial infarction or death from coronary causes among 3745 patients with acute coronary syndromes.
RESULTS: Patients in whom statin therapy resulted in LDL cholesterol levels of less than 70 mg per deciliter (1.8 mmol per liter) had lower event rates than those with higher levels (2.7 vs. 4.0 events per 100 person-years, P=0.008). However, a virtually identical difference was observed between those who had CRP levels of less than 2 mg per liter after statin therapy and those who had higher levels (2.8 vs. 3.9 events per 100 person-years, P=0.006), an effect present at all levels of LDL cholesterol achieved. For patients with post-treatment LDL cholesterol levels of more than 70 mg per deciliter, the rates of recurrent events were 4.6 per 100 person-years among those with CRP levels of more than 2 mg per liter and 3.2 events per 100 person-years among those with CRP levels of less than 2 mg per liter; the respective rates among those with LDL cholesterol levels of less than 70 mg per deciliter were 3.1 and 2.4 events per 100 person-years (P<0.001). Although atorvastatin was more likely than pravastatin to result in low levels of LDL cholesterol and CRP, meeting these targets was more important in determining the outcomes than was the specific choice of therapy. Patients who had LDL cholesterol levels of less than 70 mg per deciliter and CRP levels of less than 1 mg per liter after statin therapy had the lowest rate of recurrent events (1.9 per 100 person-years).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients who have low CRP levels after statin therapy have better clinical outcomes than those with higher CRP levels, regardless of the resultant level of LDL cholesterol.

We tested whether a glucagon-like peptide 1 agonist-based regimen can reduce GV and cardiometabolic risk markers while maintaining similar A1C levels in people with insulin-requiring type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: After run-in on metformin and basal-bolus insulin (BBI), 102 participants continued metformin and basal insulin and were randomized to exenatide dosing before the two largest meals (glucacon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist and insulin [GLIPULIN group]) or continuation of rapid-acting insulin analogs (BBI group). Indices of GV by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), hypoglycemia, weight, risk markers, and cardiac arrhythmias were assessed. The primary end point was change in glucose coefficients of variation (CV) by CGM from baseline to 26 weeks.
RESULTS: At randomization, the median A1C was 7.3% (57 mmol/mol) for GLIPULIN and 7.4% (56.3 mmol/mol) for BBI, and glucose CVs were 30.3 for BBI and 31.9 for GLIPULIN. At 26 weeks, A1C levels were similar (7.1% [54 mmol/mol] vs. 7.2% [55 mmol/mol]), whereas mean CV improved with GLIPULIN (-2.4 vs. 0.4, P = 0.047). Other GV indices followed similar nonsignificant patterns of improvement with GLIPULIN. There were no differences in hypoglycemic events during CGM or arrhythmias during electrocardiographic monitoring.

Thus, our objective was to evaluate the effects trunk stabilization vs. general strength and conditioning exercises on the automatic postural response in persons with chronic low back pain (LBP). Fifty-eight subjects with chronic, recurrent LBP (n = 58) (i.e., longer than six months) were recruited and randomly assigned to one of two, 10-week physical therapy programs: stabilization (n = 29) or strength and conditioning (n = 29). Pain and function were measured at 11 weeks and 6 months post-treatment initiation. To quantify postural following support surface perturbations, surface electrodes recorded electromyography (EMG) of trunk and leg muscles and force plates recorded forces under the feet, to calculate the center of pressure. Both groups demonstrated significant improvements in pain and function out to 6 months. There were also changes in muscle activation patterns immediately post-treatment, but not at 6 months. However, changes in center of pressure (COP) responses were treatment specific. Following treatment, the stabilization group demonstrated later onset of COP displacement, while the onset of COP displacement in the strengthening group was significantly earlier following treatment. Despite two different treatments, clinical improvements and muscle activation patterns were similar for both groups, indicating that the stabilization treatment protocol does not preferentially improve treatment outcomes or inter-muscle postural coordination patterns for persons with LBP.

Then patients were progressed to exercises that added leverage of the limbs while maintaining the co-contraction of the deeper abdominal muscles and deep dorsal trunk muscles while breathing normally. Various positions (e.g., supine and quadruped positions) were used to challenge the patients based on their tolerance. Finally, patients were progressed to exercises in more functional positions that included tasks/activities that were reported as challenging and/or painful; patients performed the tasks at the speed demanded by the particular task. Maintenance of the co-contraction of deep trunk muscles was emphasized during these functional activities.","Strength and conditioning exercise protocol: This protocol contained trunk strengthening and endurance exercises. It consisted of 3 phases: 1) initial strengthening of trunk flexors/extensors in single plane movements, 2) trunk and lower-extremity stretching as well as progression of trunk-strengthening exercises to include multi-planar trunk movements. Aerobic exercises were progressed as tolerated and patient education about body biomechanics were reinforced, and 3) trunk-strengthening exercises under dynamic conditions (e.g., unstable support surface and in multi-planar trunk movements). During the 10 week protocol, exercises became more challenging, and each subject had to complete at least the first phase before moving onto the next phase in order to be included in post-testing analyses.

However, few efforts to assess smoking cessation interventions targeting this population have been reported. In this brief report, 3-month outcomes from an ongoing treatment trial for PLWHA who smoke are described.
METHODS: Study participants were recruited from a large HIV care center serving a diverse population of PLWHA. A two-group randomized design was used to compare the efficacy of usual-care (UC) smoking cessation treatment versus a cell phone intervention (CPI). Follow-ups were conducted at the HIV clinic 3 months postenrollment. Using an intent-to-treat approach, a series of multiple regression models were used to compare smoking outcomes in the 2 groups.
RESULTS: Four hundred and seventy-four participants were enrolled and randomized, UC (n = 238) and CPI (n = 236). Mean age in the sample was 44.8 (SD = 8.1) years, and the majority were male (70.0%), Black (76.6%), and had an education level of high school or less (77.5%). At follow-up, participants in the CPI group were 4.3 (95% CI = 1.9, 9.8) times more likely to be abstinent (7 day) compared with those in the UC group. Similarly, significant point estimates were observed for the other smoking outcomes of interest.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this preliminary report indicate that a smoking cessation intervention for PLWHA consisting of cell phone-delivered proactive counseling results in significantly higher abstinence rates compared with a standard care approach. Evaluation of the long-term (6-month and 12-month) efficacy of the CPI approach is ongoing.",2,PRIMARY,Number of Participants With Abstinence,"Self-reported abstinence since the quit day, which will be verified with a salivary cotinine test at both 3-month and 6-month follow-ups",Video,Telephone,"Cognitive behavioral therapy Nicotine replacement therapy (Habitrol Patch)

METHOD: HIV+ patients with clinically significant fatigue were treated in a placebo-controlled randomized double-blind trial for 4 weeks. Armodafinil responders and placebo non-responders or relapsers were treated openly for a total of 16 weeks with armodafinil. The primary outcome measure for fatigue and depression was the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement Scale, supplemented by the Fatigue Severity Scale, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and the Beck Depression Inventory. Safety was assessed with assays of CD4 cell count and HIV RNA viral load and the SAFTEE side effects rating scale. Maximum trial dose of armodafinil was 250 mg/d.
RESULTS: Seventy patients were enrolled. Attrition was 9%. In intention-to-treat analyses, fatigue response rate to armodafinil was 75% and to placebo, 26%. Armodafinil did not reduce depressive symptoms in the absence of improved energy, but of those patients with an Axis I depressive disorder at study entry whose energy improved, 82% experienced improved mood as well. Markers of immunologic suppression did not change during treatment. At 6 months, those still taking armodafinil had more energy and fewer depressive symptoms than those who were no longer taking it.

A controlled, prospective study was done on a convenience sample of 118 patients. The ""state"" component of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used to evaluate patients' anxiety levels pre- and postaromatherapy. The control group was given an inert oil (placebo) for inhalation, and the experimental group was given the essential oil, lavender, for inhalation. The STAI state anxiety raw score revealed that patients were at the 99th (women) and 96th (men) percentiles for anxiety. The intervention group and the control group had similar levels of state anxiety prior to the beginning of the study (t[116] = .47, p = .64). There was no difference in state anxiety levels between pre- and postplacebo inhalation in the control group (t[112] = .48, p = .63). There was no statistical difference in state anxiety levels between pre- and postlavender inhalation in the experimental group (t[120] = .73, p = .47).

The underlying mechanism(s) may involve chronic low-grade systemic inflammation and immune cell activation. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (sitagliptin) improve glucose tolerance and may possess immunomodulatory effects because leukocyte CD26 cell surface receptors express dipeptidyl peptidase-4 activity.
OBJECTIVE: Sitagliptin will reduce inflammatory and immune cell activation markers known to be elevated in cART-treated HIV-infected (HIV+) adults with impaired glucose tolerance.
DESIGN: This was designed as a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of sitagliptin in HIV+ adults.
SETTING: The setting was an academic medical center.
PATIENTS: Patients were cART-treated HIV+ men and women (n = 36) with stable HIV disease and impaired glucose tolerance.
INTERVENTIONS: Interventions included sitagliptin 100 mg/d or placebo for 8 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: At baseline and week 8, plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and C-X-C motif chemokine 10 concentrations (ELISA), oral glucose tolerance, and abdominal sc adipose mRNA expression for M1 macrophage markers (monocyte chemotactic protein-1, EGF-like module-containing, mucin-like hormone receptor 1).
RESULTS: Sitagliptin reduced glucose area under the curve (P = .002) and improved oral glucose insulin sensitivity index (P = .04) more than placebo. Sitagliptin reduced plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and C-X-C motif chemokine 10 levels more than placebo (P < .009). Adipose tissue monocyte chemotactic protein-1 mRNA abundance declined significantly more (P = .01), and adipose EGF-like module-containing, mucin-like hormone receptor 1 mRNA expression tended to decline more (P = .19) in sitagliptin than placebo.

Previously, it has been demonstrated that chronic stimulation of the immune response induces pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and TNF-alpha which contribute to neurodegeneration. However, recent evidence has shown that inducing the adaptive immune response reduces Abeta pathology and is neuroprotective. Low concentrations of IFN-gamma modulate the adaptive immune response by directing microglia to differentiate to antigen presenting cells. Our objective was to determine if exercise could induce a shift from the immune profile in aged (17-19 months) Tg2576 mice to a response that reduces Abeta pathology.
METHODS: TG (n = 29) and WT (n = 27) mice were divided into sedentary (SED) and exercised (RUN) groups. RUN animals were provided an in-cage running wheel for 3 weeks. Tissue was harvested and hippocampus and cortex dissected out. Quantitative data was analyzed using 2 x 2 ANOVA and student's t-tests.
RESULTS: IL-1beta and TNF-alpha were significantly greater in hippocampi from sedentary Tg2576 (TGSED) mice than in wildtype (WTSED) (p = 0.04, p = 0.006). Immune response proteins IFN-gamma and MIP-1alpha are lower in TGSED mice than in WTSED (p = 0.03, p = 0.07). Following three weeks of voluntary wheel running, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha decreased to levels indistinguishable from WT. Concurrently, IFN-gamma and MIP-1alpha increased in TGRUN. Increased CD40 and MHCII, markers of antigen presentation, were observed in TGRUN animals compared to TGSED, as well as CD11c staining in and around plaques and vasculature. Additional vascular reactivity observed in TGRUN is consistent with an alternative activation immune pathway, involving perivascular macrophages. Significant decreases in soluble Abeta40 (p = 0.01) and soluble fibrillar Abeta (p = 0.01) were observed in the exercised transgenic animals.
CONCLUSION: Exercise shifts the immune response from innate to an adaptive or alternative response. This shift in immune response coincides with a decrease in Abeta in advanced pathological states.",0,PRIMARY,ADAS-Cog-Exec Global Composite,"The ADAS-Cog-Exec Composite is a weighted sum of standardized (Z-score) change on subtests from the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive (ADAS-Cog13; Immediate and Delayed Word Recall, Orientation, and Number Cancellation); box scores for the cognitive components of the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (Memory, Orientation, Judgement \& Problem Solving); and additional tests requiring executive function (Trail Making Test A \& B, Digit Symbol Substitution, Category Fluency).

METHODS: We randomly assigned 2499 HIV-seronegative men or transgender women who have sex with men to receive a combination of two oral antiretroviral drugs, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC-TDF), or placebo once daily. All subjects received HIV testing, risk-reduction counseling, condoms, and management of sexually transmitted infections.
RESULTS: The study subjects were followed for 3324 person-years (median, 1.2 years; maximum, 2.8 years). Of these subjects, 10 were found to have been infected with HIV at enrollment, and 100 became infected during follow-up (36 in the FTC-TDF group and 64 in the placebo group), indicating a 44% reduction in the incidence of HIV (95% confidence interval, 15 to 63; P=0.005).

The Combined Approach to Lysis Utilizing Eptifibatide and rt-PA in Acute Ischemic Stroke-Enhanced Regimen (CLEAR-ER) trial sought to determine the safety of a higher-dose regimen and to establish evidence for a phase III trial.
METHODS: CLEAR-ER was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized safety study. Ischemic stroke patients were randomized to 0.6 mg/kg rt-PA plus eptifibatide (135 mcg/kg bolus and a 2-hour infusion at 0.75 mcg/kg per minute) versus standard rt-PA (0.9 mg/kg). The primary safety end point was the incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 36 hours. The primary efficacy outcome measure was the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score ≤1 or return to baseline mRS at 90 days. Analysis of the safety and efficacy outcomes was done with multiple logistic regression.
RESULTS: Of 126 subjects, 101 received combination therapy, and 25 received standard rt-PA. Two (2%) patients in the combination group and 3 (12%) in the standard group had symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (odds ratio, 0.15; 95% confidence interval, 0.01-1.40; P=0.053). At 90 days, 49.5% of the combination group had mRS ≤1 or return to baseline mRS versus 36.0% in the standard group (odds ratio, 1.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.70-4.31; P=0.23). After adjusting for age, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, time to intravenous rt-PA, and baseline mRS, the odds ratio was 1.38 (95% confidence interval, 0.51-3.76; P=0.52).
CONCLUSIONS: The combined regimen of intravenous rt-PA and eptifibatide studied in this trial was safe and provides evidence that a phase III trial is warranted to determine efficacy of the regimen.

These abnormalities are thought to reflect a deficiency in the synchronization of pyramidal cell activity that is dependent, in part, on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission through GABA type A (GABA(A)) receptors containing alpha(2) subunits. The authors conducted a proof-of-concept clinical trial designed to test the hypothesis that a novel compound with relatively selective agonist activity at GABA(A) receptors containing alpha(2) subunits would improve cognitive function and gamma band oscillations in individuals with schizophrenia.
METHOD: Participants were male subjects (N=15) with chronic schizophrenia who were randomly assigned to receive 4 weeks of treatment with the study drug MK-0777, a benzodiazepine-like agent with selective activity at GABA(A) receptors containing alpha(2) or alpha(3) subunits, or a matched placebo in a double-blind fashion. Outcome measures were the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status, three tests of working memory and/or cognitive control (N-back, AX Continuous Performance Test, and Preparing to Overcome Prepotency), and EEG measures of gamma band oscillations induced during the Preparing to Overcome Prepotency task.
RESULTS: Compared with placebo, the MK-0777 compound was associated with improved performance on the N-back, AX Continuous Performance Test, and Preparing to Overcome Prepotency tasks. The compound was also associated with increased frontal gamma band power during the Preparing to Overcome Prepotency task. No effects of the MK-0777 compound were detected in BPRS or Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status scores, with the exception of improvement on the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status delayed memory index.

We tested the hypothesis that the simple, cheap, regimen of alemtuzumab induction combined with tacrolimus monotherapy maintenance provided equivalent outcomes to the more commonly used combination of interleukin-2 receptor monoclonal antibody induction with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil combination maintenance, both regimens using steroid withdrawal after 7 days.
METHODS: One hundred twenty-three live or deceased donor renal transplant recipients were randomized 2:1 to receive alemtuzumab/tacrolimus or daclizumab/tacrolimus/mycophenolate. The primary endpoint was survival with a functioning graft at 1 year.
RESULTS: Both regimens produced equivalent, excellent outcomes with the primary outcome measure of 97.6% in the alemtuzumab arm and 95.1% in the daclizumab arm at 1 year (95% confidence interval of difference 6.9% to -1.7%) and at 2 years 92.6% and 95.1%.

Alpha-1 adrenoreceptors mediate as much as 50% of anal resting pressure in humans. We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled study of the effects of alfuzosin, an alpha1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, on anal pressures alone in healthy women and also on bowel symptoms in women with DD.
METHODS: In a double-blind study performed from March 2013 through March 2017, anal pressures were evaluated before and after 36 women with DD (constipation for at least 1 year) and 36 healthy women (controls) were randomly assigned (1:1) to groups given oral alfuzosin (2.5 mg immediate release) or placebo. Thereafter, patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to groups given oral alfuzosin (10 mg extended release) or placebo each day for 2 weeks. Participants kept daily diaries of bowel symptoms for 2 weeks before (baseline) and during administration of the test articles (treatment). Weekly questionnaires recorded the overall severity of constipation symptoms, bloating, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting; overall satisfaction with treatment of constipation was evaluated at weeks 2 and 4. The primary endpoint was the change in the number of spontaneous (SBMs) and complete SBMs (CSBMs) between the treatment and baseline periods. We evaluated relationships between stool form, passage, and complete evacuation.
RESULTS: Alfuzosin reduced anal resting pressure by 32 ± 3 mm Hg versus 16 ± 3 mm Hg for placebo (P = .0001) and anal pressure during evacuation by 26 ± 3 mm Hg versus 16 ± 3 mm Hg for placebo, (P = .03). However, alfuzosin did not significantly increase the rectoanal gradient, SBMs or CSBMs compared with placebo. Both formulations of alfuzosin were well tolerated. Hard stools and the ease of passage during defecation accounted for 72% and 76% of the variance in the satisfaction after defecation, respectively, during baseline and treatment periods.
CONCLUSIONS: In a randomized trial, alfuzosin reduced anal pressure at rest and during simulated evacuation in healthy and constipated women, compared with placebo, but did not improve bowel symptoms in constipated women. This could be because the drug does not improve stool form or dyssynergia, which also contribute to DD.

We evaluated the efficacy of ixazomib maintenance therapy after reduced-intensity conditioning allo-HCT from HLA-matched donors in patients with high-risk MM. The primary study endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) postrandomization, treated as a time to event. Secondary endpoints were grade II-IV and grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), chronic GVHD, best response, disease progression, nonrelapse mortality (NRM), overall survival (OS), toxicity, infection, and health-related quality of life. In this phase 2, double-blinded, prospective multicenter trial, we randomized patients with high-risk MM (ie, those with poor-risk cytogenetics, plasma cell leukemia, or relapsing within 24 months after autologous HCT) to ixazomib (3 mg on days 1, 8, and 15) or placebo after allo-HCT.

This retrospective analysis examined safety data from clinical trials involving the off-label use of this formulation in peripheral nerve blocks.
METHODS: Data from 6 controlled (phases I-III) studies were compiled involving single-injection ankle, femoral nerve, and intercostal nerve blocks (2 each). Adverse events (AEs) were monitored for 1 to 30 days after study drug administration.
RESULTS: Of 575 subjects, 335 received liposome bupivacaine (2-310 mg), 33 received bupivacaine HCl (75-125 mg), and 207 received normal saline (placebo). Overall, 76% of subjects receiving liposome bupivacaine experienced 1 or more AEs compared with 61% receiving bupivacaine HCl and 76% receiving placebo. The most frequently reported AEs among subjects receiving liposome bupivacaine were nausea, pyrexia, pruritus, constipation, and vomiting. The most common treatment-related AE was hypesthesia among subjects treated with liposome bupivacaine or bupivacaine HCl. Incidence of nervous system AEs for liposome bupivacaine, bupivacaine HCl, and placebo was 21%, 27%, and 21%, respectively. Similarly, incidence of cardiac AEs was 9%, 0%, and 12%, respectively.

This trial was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of ataluren in patients with nonsense-mutation cystic fibrosis.
METHODS: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study enrolled patients from 36 sites in 11 countries in North America and Europe. Eligible patients with nonsense-mutation cystic fibrosis (aged ≥ 6 years; abnormal nasal potential difference; sweat chloride >40 mmol/L; forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV1] ≥ 40% and ≤ 90%) were randomly assigned by interactive response technology to receive oral ataluren (10 mg/kg in morning, 10 mg/kg midday, and 20 mg/kg in evening) or matching placebo for 48 weeks. Randomisation used a block size of four, stratified by age, chronic inhaled antibiotic use, and percent-predicted FEV1. The primary endpoint was relative change in percent-predicted FEV1 from baseline to week 48, analysed in all patients with a post-baseline spirometry measurement.

FINDINGS: Between Sept 8, 2009, and Nov 30, 2010, 238 patients were randomly assigned, of whom 116 in each treatment group had a valid post-baseline spirometry measurement. Relative change from baseline in percent-predicted FEV1 did not differ significantly between ataluren and placebo at week 48 (-2.5% vs -5.5%; difference 3.0% [95% CI -0.8 to 6.3]; p=0.12). The number of pulmonary exacerbations did not differ significantly between treatment groups (rate ratio 0.77 [95% CI 0.57-1.05]; p=0.0992). However, post-hoc analysis of the subgroup of patients not using chronic inhaled tobramycin showed a 5.7% difference (95% CI 1.5-10.1) in relative change from baseline in percent-predicted FEV1 between the ataluren and placebo groups at week 48 (-0.7% [-4.0 to 2.1] vs -6.4% [-9.8 to -3.7]; nominal p=0.0082), and fewer pulmonary exacerbations in the ataluern group (1.42 events [0.9-1.9] vs 2.18 events [1.6-2.7]; rate ratio 0.60 [0.42-0.86]; nominal p=0.0061). Safety profiles were generally similar for ataluren and placebo, except for the occurrence of increased creatinine concentrations (ie, acute kidney injury), which occurred in 18 (15%) of 118 patients in the ataluren group compared with one (<1%) of 120 patients in the placebo group. No life-threatening adverse events or deaths were reported in either group.

With changes in post-traumatic stress disorder diagnostic criteria in 2013, current information from a uniform data source is needed.
METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of the 2012-2013 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions-III, which consisted of in-person interviews that were conducted with a representative sample of U.S. adults. The Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule-DSM-5 Version was used to assess past-year and lifetime post-traumatic stress disorder among veterans (n=3,119) and civilians (n=32,982). Data were analyzed from January to March 2017.
RESULTS: Adjusting for age and race/ethnicity, women veterans reported the highest rates of lifetime and past-year post-traumatic stress disorder (13.4%, 95% CI=8.8%, 17.9%, and 11.7%, 95% CI=7.1%, 16.4%) compared with women civilians (8.0%, 95% CI=7.4%, 8.6%, and 6.0%, 95% CI=5.5%, 6.6%); men veterans (7.7%, 95% CI=6.5%, 8.8%, and 6.7%, 95% CI=5.7%, 7.8%); and men civilians (3.4%, 95% CI=3.0%, 3.9%, and 2.6%, 95% CI=2.2%, 2.9%). Traumatic event exposure, correlates of lifetime post-traumatic stress disorder, and treatment seeking varied across subgroups. Men and women veterans were more likely than civilians to use a variety of treatment sources, with men civilians being least likely to seek treatment and men veterans exhibiting the longest delay in seeking treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Post-traumatic stress disorder is a common mental health disorder that varies by gender and veteran status.

Even though coffee intake has been associated with some health benefits in epidemiological studies, the bioavailability of coffee phenolics is not fully understood.
OBJECTIVE AND STUDY DESIGN: We performed a dose-response study measuring plasma bioavailability of phenolics after drinking three increasing, but still nutritionally relevant doses of instant pure soluble coffee. The study design was a one treatment (coffee) three-dose randomized cross-over design, with a washout period of 2 wks between visits.
RESULTS: CGAs, phenolic acids, and late-appearing metabolites all increased with increasing ingested dose. Hence, the sum of area under the curve was significantly higher for the medium to low dose, and high to medium dose, by 2.23- and 2.38-fold, respectively. CGAs were not well absorbed in their intact form, regardless of the dose. CGA and phenolic acids appeared rapidly in plasma, indicating an early absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. Late-appearing metabolites were the most abundant, regardless of the dose.
CONCLUSION: This study confirmed previous findings about coffee bioavailability but also showed that coffee phenolics appear in a positive dose-response manner in plasma when drank at nutritionally relevant doses.",2,PRIMARY,Glycated Hemoglobin A1c (A1C),Shows what a person's average blood glucose level was for the 2 to 3 months before the test high-performance.,Chlorogenic Acid,Placebo,"1200 mg dose per day, three capsules of 400 mg, times daily 1/ 2 hour before meals during 90 days.

Immediate at time of surgery,22939276,A randomized prospective multicenter trial of a novel vascular sealant.,"BACKGROUND: Increasing use of anticoagulant medications, particularly antiplatelet therapies, can increase the difficulty in obtaining adequate suture line hemostasis. Multiple vascular sealants have been used as adjuncts to surgical procedures, but none of them have been universally successful. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a new prophylactic vascular sealant in arterial surgery.
METHODS: A randomized prospective multi-institutional trial was undertaken comparing ArterX Vascular Sealant (AVS) with Gelfoam Plus during open arterial reconstruction.
RESULTS: Three hundred thirty-one anastomotic sites in 217 patients were randomized. One hundred one of 167 (60.5%) anastomotic sites in the AVS group achieved immediate hemostasis compared with 65 of 164 (39.6%) in the control group (P = 0.001). In anastomoses with polytetrafluoroethylene grafts, 105 of 167 (62.5%) in the AVS group achieved immediate hemostasis compared with 56 of 164 (34.0%) in the control group (P < 0.001). No significant differences were noted in morbidity or mortality. Operative time was significantly less in the AVS group compared with the control group (3.2 vs. 3.8 hours, P < 0.01).

Nicotine replacement (NRT) could improve outcomes previously observed with vouchers without NRT.
METHODS: A randomized controlled trial compared contingent vouchers (CV) for smoking abstinence to noncontingent vouchers (NV), when all received counseling and NRT. Smokers who had not sought smoking treatment (n=340) in residential SUD treatment were provided 14days of vouchers for complete smoking abstinence per exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) after a 5-day smoking reduction period, or vouchers only for breath samples, plus brief advice (four sessions) and 8weeks of NRT.
RESULTS: Within treatment, 20% had complete abstinence with CV, 5% with NV (p<.001), and participants showed 50% of days abstinent in CV compared to 22% in NV (p<.001). Across 1, 3, 6 and 12months after randomization, CV resulted in significantly fewer cigarettes per day (p<.01) and fewer days smoking (p<.01), but with small effects. Point-prevalence abstinence differences across follow-up (e.g., 4% CV, 2% in NV at 6 and 12months) were not significant. No differences in substance use were seen.
CONCLUSIONS: Within-treatment effects on abstinence are stronger than in a prior study of the same CV with BA but without NRT, but NRT does not improve abstinence after vouchers end.

Liraglutide may be useful for weight management in adolescents with obesity.
METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind trial, which consisted of a 56-week treatment period and a 26-week follow-up period, we enrolled adolescents (12 to <18 years of age) with obesity and a poor response to lifestyle therapy alone. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either liraglutide (3.0 mg) or placebo subcutaneously once daily, in addition to lifestyle therapy. The primary end point was the change from baseline in the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) standard-deviation score at week 56.
RESULTS: A total of 125 participants were assigned to the liraglutide group and 126 to the placebo group. Liraglutide was superior to placebo with regard to the change from baseline in the BMI standard-deviation score at week 56 (estimated difference, -0.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.37 to -0.08; P = 0.002).

Between-group differences for ALN/D5600 versus calcitriol were significant (p < 0.001) at months 6 and 12 for change from baseline in procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (-59.1 versus -16.8 %, -68.1 versus -17.0 %) and serum C-telopeptides (-79.2 versus -27.2 %, -76.2 versus -24.2 %). Drug-related adverse events (AEs) and discontinuations due to drug-related AEs occurred in 15 (14.0 %) versus 8 (7.4 %) patients and 3 (2.8 %) versus 0 patients in the ALN/D5600 and calcitriol group, respectively.

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of ergocalciferol administration on fibroblast growth factor 23 levels in healthy vitamin D-deficient subjects.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: In this 12-week trial conducted in a clinical research center, 18- to 45-year-old subjects (n=90) with 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels ≤20 ng/ml (by chemiluminescent immunoassay) were randomized to weekly ergocalciferol treatment of 50,000 international units or placebo, while consuming a self-selected diet. Changes in fibroblast growth factor 23, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectroscopy), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone, and serum phosphate were measured.
RESULTS: Mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D (P<0.0001), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (P=0.01), and fibroblast growth factor 23 (P=0.003) increased in the treatment versus placebo group. In the treatment group, 25-hydroxyvitamin D increased from 18 ± 7 to 40 ± 12 ng/ml at week 4 (P<0.0001) and remained stable at 43 ± 12 ng/ml at week 12 (P<0.0001); 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D increased from 42 ± 17 to 52 ± 18 pg/ml at week 4 (P<0.001) and then remained stable, and fibroblast growth factor 23 increased from 43 ± 17 to 60 ± 33 pg/ml at week 8 (P=0.001) and 74 ± 42 pg/ml at week 12 (P<0.0001). Urinary phosphate excretion increased within the treatment group, but parathyroid hormone and serum phosphate were unchanged.
CONCLUSIONS: Ergocalciferol administration increases circulating fibroblast growth factor 23.

This study investigated whether cigarette demand predicted response to contingent monetary rewards for abstinence among individuals with substance use disorders. It also sought to replicate evidence for greater price sensitivity at whole-dollar pack price transitions (ie, left-digit effects).
METHODS: Participants (N = 338) were individuals in residential substance use disorder treatment who participated in a randomized controlled trial that compared contingent vouchers to noncontingent vouchers for smoking abstinence. Baseline demand indices were used to predict number of abstinent days during the 14-day voucher period (after the reduction lead-in) and at 1 and 3 months afterward.
RESULTS: Demand indices correlated with measures of smoking and nicotine dependence. As measured by elasticity, intensity and O max, higher demand significantly predicted fewer abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings during voucher period for individuals in the noncontingent vouchers condition. Breakpoint exhibited a trend-level association with abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings. Demand indices did not predict abstinence in the contingent vouchers group, and did not predict abstinence at 1- and 3-month follow-ups. Left-digit price transitions were associated with significantly greater reductions in consumption.
CONCLUSIONS: The association of cigarette demand with smoking behavior only in the group for whom abstinence was not incentivized indicates that CPT assesses the value of smoking more than the value of money per se and that vouchers counteract the effects of the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes. Results provide initial short-term evidence of predictive validity for the CPT indices.
IMPLICATIONS: This study provides the first evidence of the validity of the CPT for predicting early response to brief advice for smoking cessation plus nicotine replacement in smokers with substance dependence. However, demand for cigarettes did not predict voucher-based treatment response, indicating that incentives serve as a powerful motivator not to smoke that acts in opposition to the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes and that the indices reflect the value of smoking more than the value of money per se.",0,PRIMARY,Average Number of Cigarettes Per Day,No Description Available,Contingency Management (CM),Noncontingent Reinforcement (NR),"Condition provides contingent monetary reinforcement for smoking reductions (first 5 days) then for smoking abstinence (subsequent 14 days).

We aimed to examine associations of quantitative gastrointestinal and psychological traits with obesity, and to validate the ability of these traits to predict responses of obese individuals to pharmacotherapy.
METHODS: In a prospective study, we measured gastric emptying of solids and liquids, fasting and postprandial gastric volume, satiation by nutrient drink test (volume to fullness and maximal tolerated volume), satiety after an ad libitum buffet meal, gastrointestinal hormones, and psychological traits in 328 normal-weight, overweight, or obese adults. We also analyzed data from 181 previously studied adults to assess associations betwecen a subset of traits with body mass index and waist circumference. Latent dimensions associated with overweight or obesity were appraised by principal component analyses. We performed a proof of concept, placebo-controlled trial of extended-release phentermine and topiramate in 24 patients to validate associations between quantitative traits and response to weight-loss therapy.
RESULTS: In the prospective study, obesity was associated with fasting gastric volume (P = .03), accelerated gastric emptying (P < .001 for solids and P = .011 for liquids), lower postprandial levels of peptide tyrosine tyrosine (P = .003), and higher postprandial levels of glucagon-like peptide 1 (P < .001). In a combined analysis of data from all studies, obesity was associated with higher volume to fullness (n = 509; P = .038) and satiety with abnormal waist circumference (n = 271; P = .016). Principal component analysis identified latent dimensions that accounted for approximately 81% of the variation among overweight and obese subjects, including satiety or satiation (21%), gastric motility (14%), psychological factors (13%), and gastric sensorimotor factors (11%). The combination of phentermine and topiramate caused significant weight loss, slowed gastric emptying, and decreased calorie intake; weight loss in response to phentermine and topiramate was significantly associated with calorie intake at the prior satiety test.
CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative traits are associated with high body mass index; they can distinguish obesity phenotypes and, in a proof of concept clinical trial, predicted response to pharmacotherapy for obesity.

The ECG changes were studied in order to correlate them with cardiovascular function, as measured by heart rate, mean arterial pressure, end diastolic pressure and combined cardiac output, estimated by the thermodilution method, as well as with blood gases and acid-base status. Close correlations were obtained between PaO2, pH and base deficit and the severity of ECG changes, graded according to a scoring system. Alterations in the ECG pattern consistently preceeded signs of failing cardiovascular function. Our previous findings indicated that the hypoxic ECG changes could be regarded as a sign of myocardial glycolysis.

The objective of this study was to determine serum malondialdehyde (MDA) levels during the first week of follow up, whether such levels are associated with severity during the first week and whether non-surviving patients showed higher MDA levels than survivors during the first week.
METHODS: We performed an observational, prospective, multicenter study in six Spanish Intensive Care Units. Serum levels of MDA were measured in 328 patients (215 survivors and 113 non-survivors) with severe sepsis at days one, four and eight of diagnosis, and in 100 healthy controls. The primary endpoint was 30-day mortality and the secondary endpoint was six -month mortality. The association between continuous variables was carried out using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Cox regression analysis was applied to determine the independent contribution of serum MDA levels on the prediction of 30-day and 6-month mortality. Hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated as measures of the clinical impact of the predictor variables.
RESULTS: We found higher serum MDA in septic patients at day one (p < 0.001), day four (p < 0.001) and day eight (p < 0.001) of diagnosis than in healthy controls. Serum MDA was lower in surviving than non-surviving septic patients at day one (p < 0.001), day four (p < 0.001) and day eight (p < 0.001). Serum MDA levels were positively correlated with lactic acid and SOFA during the first week. Finally, serum MDA levels were associated with 30-day mortality (HR = 1.05; 95% CI = 1.02-1.09; p = 0.005) and six-month mortality (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.05; 95% CI = 1.02-1.09; p = 0.003) after controlling for lactic acid levels, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE)-II, diabetes mellitus, bloodstream infection and chronic renal failure.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the largest series providing data on the oxidative state in septic patients to date. The novel finding is that high serum MDA levels sustained throughout the first week of follow up were associated with severity and mortality in septic patients.",2,PRIMARY,Mean Umbilical Artery Lactate at Delivery,Determined by umbilical artery cord gas collected at time of delivery and only in patients with paired (umbilical artery and umbilical vein) cord gases.,Room Air,Oxygen,"Room air, no mask",10L oxygen by nonrebreather mask,DRUG,DRUG,EXPERIMENTAL,ACTIVE_COMPARATOR,['0.69'],['Wilcoxon (Mann-Whitney)'],['Non-Inferiority'],2013-Dec-11

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the benefit of cetuximab added to concurrent chemoradiation therapy for patients undergoing nonoperative treatment of esophageal carcinoma.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A National Cancer Institute (NCI) sponsored, multicenter, phase 3, randomized clinical trial open to patients with biopsy-proven carcinoma of the esophagus. The study accrued 344 patients from 2008 to 2013.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to weekly concurrent cisplatin (50 mg/m2), paclitaxel (25 mg/m2), and daily radiation of 50.4 Gy/1.8 Gy fractions with or without weekly cetuximab (400 mg/m2 on day 1 then 250 mg/m2 weekly).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Overall survival (OS) was the primary endpoint, with a study designed to detect an increase in 2-year OS from 41% to 53%; 80% power and 1-sided α = .025.
RESULTS: Between June 30, 2008, and February 8, 2013, 344 patients were enrolled. This analysis used all data received at NRG Oncology through April 12, 2015. Sixteen patients were ineligible, resulting in 328 evaluable patients, 159 in the experimental arm and 169 in the control arm. Patients were well matched between the treatment arms for patient and tumor characteristics: 263 (80%) with T3 or T4 disease, 215 (66%) N1, and 62 (19%) with celiac nodal involvement. Incidence of grade 3, 4, or 5 treatment-related adverse events at any time was 71 (46%), 35 (23%), or 6 (4%) in the experimental arm and 83 (50%), 28 (17%), or 2 (1%) in the control arm, respectively. A clinical complete response (cCR) rate of 81 (56%) was observed in the experimental arm vs 92 (58%) in the control arm (Fisher exact test, P = .66). No differences were seen in cCR between treatment arms for either histology (adenocarcinoma or squamous cell). Median follow-up for all patients was 18.6 months. The 24- and 36-month local failure for the experimental arm was 47% (95% CI, 38%-57%) and 49% (95% CI, 40%-59%) vs 49% (95% CI, 41%-58%) and 49% (95% CI, 41%-58%) for the control arm (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.66-1.28; P = .65). The 24- and 36-month OS rates for the experimental arm were 45% (95% CI, 37%-53%) and 34% (95% CI, 26%-41%) vs 44% (95% CI, 36%-51%) and 28% (95% CI, 21%-35%) for the control arm (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.70-1.16; P = .47).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The addition of cetuximab to concurrent chemoradiation did not improve OS. These phase 3 trial results point to little benefit to current EGFR-targeted agents in an unselected patient population, and highlight the need for predictive biomarkers in the treatment of esophageal cancer.

METHOD: The study was conducted from July 2008 until February 2011. Subjects requiring chronic treatment with an antipsychotic entered a 4- to 12-week oral stabilization phase and received oral aripiprazole (10-30 mg/d). Subjects meeting stability criteria for 4 weeks entered an IM-depot stabilization phase in which they received 400-mg aripiprazole-IM-depot injections every 4 weeks (single decrease to 300 mg permitted) with coadministration of oral aripiprazole tablets in the first 2 weeks. Subjects meeting stability criteria for 12 consecutive weeks were randomly assigned (2:1) to aripiprazole-IM-depot or placebo during a 52-week, double-blind maintenance phase. The primary outcome measure was time to exacerbation of psychotic symptoms/impending relapse (event). Safety and tolerability were also assessed.
RESULTS: 710 patients entered oral stabilization, 576 progressed to IM-depot stabilization, and 403 were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment. The study was terminated early because efficacy was demonstrated by the preplanned interim analysis (conducted after 64 events). Time to impending relapse was significantly delayed with aripiprazole-IM-depot treatment compared with placebo in both the interim analysis and the final analysis (P < .0001, log-rank test). The hazard ratio (placebo/aripiprazole-IM-depot) at final analysis was 5.03 (95% CI, 3.15-8.02).

METHODS: Cross sectional study of migrant FSW attending a sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinic in Madrid during 2002. Information on sociodemographic characteristics, reproductive and sexual health, smoking, time in commercial sex work, history of STIs, HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis, and genitourinary infections was collected. High risk HPV Infection was determined through the Digene HPV Test, Hybrid Capture II. Data were analysed through multiple logistic regression.
RESULTS: 734 women were studied. Overall HPV prevalence was 39%; 61% in eastern Europeans, 42% in Ecuadorians, 39% in Colombians, 29% in sub-Saharan Africans, and 24% in Caribbeans (p = 0.057).

Interventions may be needed to address age and racial disparities to achieve the recommended childhood influenza vaccination target of 70%.
PURPOSE: To evaluate an intervention to increase childhood influenza vaccination across age and racial groups.
METHODS: In 2011-2012, a total of 20 primary care practices treating children were randomly assigned to the intervention and control arms of a cluster randomized controlled trial to increase childhood influenza vaccination uptake using a toolkit and other strategies including early delivery of donated vaccine, in-service staff meetings, and publicity.
RESULTS: The average vaccination differences from pre-intervention to the intervention year were significantly larger in the intervention arm (n=10 practices) than the control arm (n=10 practices); for children aged 9-18 years (11.1 pct pts intervention vs 4.3 pct pts control, p<0.05); for non-white children (16.7 pct pts intervention vs 4.6 pct pts control, p<0.001); and overall (9.9 pct pts intervention vs 4.2 pct pts control, p<0.01). In multi-level modeling that accounted for person- and practice-level variables and the interactions among age, race, and intervention, the likelihood of vaccination increased with younger age group (6-23 months); white race; commercial insurance; the practice's pre-intervention vaccination rate; and being in the intervention arm. Estimates of the interaction terms indicated that the intervention increased the likelihood of vaccination for non-white children in all age groups and white children aged 9-18 years.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study had on 120 individuals with normal glucose tolerance (49 males and 71 females). A single slice CT scan at L4- L5 was done for measurement of visceral and subcutaneous abdominal fat. Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the South Asian Modified National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria (SAM-NCEP) criteria. Insulin Sensitivity Index (ISI-Matsuda) was used to assess insulin sensitivity/resistance.
RESULTS: Linear regression analysis revealed that visceral, but not subcutaneous fat was associated with serum triglycerides (R(2);=0.457,beta= 0.34; P=0.006), HDL cholesterol (R(2);=0.430, beta= -0.051; P=0.018) and ISI-Matsuda (R(2);=0.437, beta= -0.05; P=0.039) after adjusting for age, gender and BMI. Visceral fat showed significant association with metabolic syndrome (OR: 1.013, 95% CI: 1.001- 1.025; P=0.041) even after adjusting for age, gender, body mass index and glycated haemoglobin whereas subcutaneous fat did not show such an association.

METHODS: A validated, patient-reported questionnaire (OMDQ), the FACT quality of life (QOL), and the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) fatigue scales were used to measure mucositis (reported as mouth and throat soreness), daily functioning, and use of analgesics. Patients were studied before radiotherapy (RT), daily during RT, and for 4 weeks after RT.
RESULTS: Contrary to previous reports, the risk of mucositis was virtually identical in the 126 patients with oral cavity or oropharynx tumors (99% overall; 85% grade 3-4) compared with 65 patients with tumors of the larynx or hypopharynx (98% overall; 77% grade 3-4). The mean QOL score decreased significantly during RT, from 85.1 at baseline to 69.0 at Week 6, corresponding with the peak of mucositis severity. The mean functional status score decreased by 33% from 18.3 at baseline to 12.3 at Week 6. The impact of mucositis on QOL was proportional to its severity, although even a score of 1 or 2 (mild or moderate) was associated with a significant reduction in QOL (from 93.6 at baseline to 74.7 at Week 6). Despite increases in analgesic use from 34% at baseline to 80% at Week 6, mean mucositis scores exceeded 2.5 at Week 6.

METHODS: This descriptive study was conducted between 15 October 2010 and 15 January 2011 in subjects who voluntarily agreed to participate in the study from three dialysis centers in a city located in the Central Anatolia Region of Turkey. One hundred and twenty-one individuals treated with hemodialysis made up the study sample. The data were collected using a questionnaire consisting of 41 questions and the Dialysis Diet and Fluid Non-adherence Questionnaire. The data were evaluated with percentage, median, Mann-Whitney U-test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Student's t-test in independent samples and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.
RESULTS: The authors found that 98.3% of the individuals experienced non-adherence to diet and 95.0% with fluid restriction. The authors found a weak and negative relationship between calcium levels and non-adherence to fluid restriction, a weak relationship between phosphorus levels and diet non-adherence frequency and degree and the fluid non-adherence frequency scores, and a moderate positive relationship between phosphorus levels and fluid restriction non-adherence degree scores (P < 0.05).

DESIGN: Prospective, controlled trial.
SETTING: Research laboratory at an academic medical institution.
SUBJECTS: New Zealand White Rabbits.
INTERVENTIONS: Anesthetized, tracheotomized, and ventilated New Zealand White rabbits were injected with freshly prepared, 111In(oxine)3 labeled single donor platelets through the external jugular vein. After baseline measurements, these animals were placed on venovenous extracorporeal circulation through a 1-m control circuit or NO test circuit for 4 hrs at a blood flow rate of 109-118 mL/min via roller pump. Four groups were studied: systemically heparinized control circuits, systemically heparinized NO test circuits, nonheparinized control circuits, and nonheparinized NO test circuits. Platelet counts, fibrinogen levels, and plasma free indium levels were measured hourly. Circuits were rinsed and retained for gamma counting after the 4-hr run or when the circuit clotted. Four animals, one from each group, did not receive radiolabeled platelets so that the circuits could be preserved for scanning electron microscopic examination after the 4-hr study.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Platelet consumption was significantly reduced in both the heparinized and nonheparinized NO test groups when compared with the controls (p < .0001 and p < .0004, respectively). Platelet adhesion to the extracorporeal circuits was significantly reduced in the nonheparinized test circuits when compared with the controls (p < .05). Scanning electron microscopic examination of the circuits revealed that in the absence of heparin and in the presence of a NO-releasing surface, platelets retained their spherical nonactivated shape.

METHODS: Data for this analysis were from three large, placebo-controlled clinical studies that examined sitagliptin 100 mg q.d. as add-on to metformin therapy or as monotherapy over 18 or 24 weeks. In these studies, subsets of patients consented to undergo extensive blood sampling as part of a nine-point meal tolerance test performed at baseline and study end-point. Blood samples were collected at -10, 0, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 180 min relative to the start of a meal and subsequently were assayed for plasma glucose and serum C-peptide concentrations. Parameters for beta-cell function were calculated using the C-peptide minimal model, which estimates insulin secretion rate (ISR) and partitions the ISR into basal (Phi(b); ISR at basal glucose concentrations), static (Phi(s); ISR at above basal glucose concentrations following a meal) and dynamic (Phi(d); ISR in response to the rate of increase in above basal glucose concentrations following a meal) components. The total responsivity index (Phi(total); average ISR over the average glucose concentration) is calculated as a function of Phi(s), Phi(d )and Phi(b. )Insulin sensitivity was assessed with a validated composite index (ISI). Disposition indices (DI), which assess insulin secretion in the context of changes in insulin sensitivity, were calculated as the product of Phiand ISI.
RESULTS: When administered in combination with ongoing metformin therapy or as monotherapy, sitagliptin was associated with substantial reductions in postprandial glycaemic excursion following a meal challenge relative to placebo. Sitagliptin produced significant (p < 0.05 vs. placebo) improvements in Phi(s )and Phi(total), regardless of treatment regimen (add-on to metformin or as monotherapy). For Phi(d), there was a numerical, but not statistically significant, improvement with sitagliptin relative to placebo. Treatment with sitagliptin increased Phi(b), but the difference relative to placebo was only significant with monotherapy. ISI was not significantly different between sitagliptin and placebo. The DIs for the static, dynamic and total measures were significantly (p < 0.05) increased with sitagliptin treatment relative to placebo.

We evaluated the efficacy of the individualized texting for adherence building (iTAB) intervention among persons living with HIV (PLWH) who meet criteria for METH use disorder. We examined daily associations between ART adherence and text-reported METH use and depressed mood.
METHODS: We conducted a single site, 2-arm, 6-week, pilot randomized clinical trial comparing a personalized, bidirectional, text messaging system (iTAB; n = 50) to an active control condition (n = 25). All participants received adherence psychoeducation and daily texts assessing METH use and depressed mood. The iTAB group received personalized daily ART reminder texts. ART adherence was monitored using Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) caps.
RESULTS: Response rates to daily ART reminder texts were high (79%), with good concordance between MEMS-derived and text-reported ART adherence (p < .001). Intervention groups did not differ in MEMS-derived ART adherence (68% iTAB, 70% active control; p = .68); however, participants in the iTAB group had fewer METH use days (median 14.4 iTAB, 22.0 active control; p = .05). Text-reported METH use, but not depressed mood, was associated with poorer MEMS-derived ART adherence.
CONCLUSIONS: High text response rates and good concordance between MEMS-derived and text-reported adherence suggests text messaging is a feasible intervention delivery approach that provides a valid indication of ART adherence.

The primary end point was overall survival (OS). Other efficacy outcomes, safety, and immunogenicity were also assessed.
RESULTS: Patient characteristics were balanced between arms; 12.3% of patients had received prior bevacizumab. (Ziv-)Aflibercept did not improve OS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.01; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.17; stratified log-rank P = .90).

Huntington Study Group.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the rate of functional decline in a large cohort of patients with Huntington's disease (HD) followed at 43 sites by the Huntington Study Group (HSG).
METHODS: The annual rate of functional decline was measured using the Total Functional Capacity Scale (TFC) and the Independence Scale (IS) in 960 patients with definite HD followed prospectively for a mean of 18.3 months. All patients were rated with the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS). Sample size calculations for hypothetical clinical trials were calculated.
RESULTS: A factor analysis of the UHDRS at baseline yielded 15 factors accounting for 77% of the variance. The TFC score declined at a rate of 0.72 units/year (standard error [SE] 0.04) and the IS score declined at a rate of 4.52 units/year (SE 0.23). Lower TFC score at baseline, indicating more severe impairment, was associated with less rapid annual decline in TFC score, perhaps reflecting the floor effect of the scale. The annual rate of decline for 575 patients with baseline TFC scores of 7 to 13 was 0.97 (SE 0.06), was 0.38 (SE 0.08) for 270 patients with baseline TFC scores of 3 to 6, and was 0.06 (SE 0.1) for 101 patients with TFC scores of 0 to 2. In multivariate analysis (n = 960), longer disease duration and better cognitive status at baseline were associated with a less rapid rate of decline in TFC score, whereas depressive symptomatology was the only factor associated with more rapid decline on the IS score. Age at onset of HD, sex, weight, and education did not affect decline on either score.
CONCLUSIONS: The comparable rates of decline on the TFC and the IS scores with other published studies suggest that these estimates of functional decline are representative of HD patients who are evaluated at HSG research sites. In longitudinal analysis, longer disease duration and better neuropsychological performance at baseline were associated with a less rapid rate of decline in TFC score, whereas depressive symptomatology at baseline was associated with a more rapid decline in the IS score.

In animal models, Org 25935 has dose-dependent effects on ethanol intake, preference, and relapse-like behavior without tolerance. The current study aimed to translate these animal findings to humans by examining whether Org 25935 prevents relapse in detoxified alcohol-dependent patients.
METHODS: This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Adult patients diagnosed with alcohol dependence were randomly assigned to receive Org 25935 12 mg twice a day or placebo for 84 days. The primary end point was percentage heavy drinking days (defined as ≥ 5 standard drinks per day for men and ≥ 4 for women). Secondary end points included other measures of relapse-related drinking behavior (e.g., drinks per day, time to relapse), as well as measures of global functioning, alcohol-related thoughts and cravings, and motivation.
RESULTS: A total of 140 subjects were included in the intent-to-treat analysis. The trial was stopped approximately midway after a futility analysis showing that the likelihood of detecting a signal at study term was <40%. There was no significant difference between Org 25935 and placebo on percentage heavy drinking days or any other measure of relapse-related drinking behavior.

Various drugs have been studied using local delivery to improve the periodontal health and to achieve periodontal regeneration. Simvastatin (SMV) is a specific competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-2-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase. The present study was designed to investigate the effectiveness of SMV, 1.2 mg, in an indigenously prepared biodegradable controlled-release gel as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) in the treatment of chronic periodontitis.
METHODS: Sixty patients were categorized into two treatment groups: SRP plus placebo (group 1) and SRP plus SMV, 1.2 mg (group 2). Clinical parameters were recorded at baseline before SRP and at 1, 2, 4, and 6 months; they included modified sulcus bleeding index (mSBI), probing depth (PD), and clinical attachment level (CAL). At baseline and after 6 months, radiologic assessment of intrabony defect (IBD) fill was done using computer-aided software. The mean concentration of SMV in gingival crevicular fluid was estimated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography.
RESULTS: All subjects tolerated the drug, without any postapplication inflammation. Both therapies resulted in significant improvements. The decrease in mSBI score at 6 months was greater in group 2 (2.3267 +/- 0.8017) compared to group 1 (0.5033 +/- 0.6815).

PURPOSE: To determine whether risk stratification for advanced colorectal neoplasia (ACN) influences provider willingness to comply with patient preferences when selecting a desired CRC screening option.
DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial.
SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Asymptomatic, average-risk patients due for CRC screening in an urban safety net health care setting.
INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized 1:1 to a decision aid alone (n= 168) or decision aid plus risk assessment (n= 173) arm between September 2012 and September 2014.
OUTCOMES: The primary outcome was concordance between patient preference and test ordered; secondary outcomes included patient satisfaction with the decision-making process, screening intentions, test completion rates, and provider satisfaction.
RESULTS: Although providers perceived risk stratification to be useful in selecting an appropriate screening test for their average-risk patients, no significant differences in concordance were observed between the decision aid alone and decision aid plus risk assessment groups (88.1% v. 85.0%,P= 0.40) or high- and low-risk groups (84.5% v. 87.1%,P= 0.51). Concordance was highest for colonoscopy and relatively low for tests other than colonoscopy, regardless of study arm or risk group. Failure to comply with patient preferences was negatively associated with satisfaction with the decision-making process, screening intentions, and test completion rates.
LIMITATIONS: Single-institution setting; lack of provider education about the utility of risk stratification into their decision making.

INTERVENTION: One of 4 treatment sequences that each included two 3-month courses of rilonacept, 2.2 mg/kg (maximum, 160 mg) by weekly subcutaneous injection, and two 3-month courses of placebo.
MEASUREMENTS: Differences in the frequency of FMF attacks and adverse events between rilonacept and placebo.
RESULTS: 8 males and 6 females with a mean age of 24.4 years (SD, 11.8) were randomly assigned. Among 12 participants who completed 2 or more treatment courses, the rilonacept-placebo attack risk ratio was 0.59 (SD, 0.12) (equal-tail 95% credible interval, 0.39 to 0.85). The median number of attacks per month was 0.77 (0.18 and 1.20 attacks in the first and third quartiles, respectively) with rilonacept versus 2.00 (0.90 and 2.40, respectively) with placebo (median difference, -1.74 [95% CI, -3.4 to -0.1]; P = 0.027). There were more treatment courses of rilonacept without attacks (29% vs. 0%; P = 0.004) and with a decrease in attacks of greater than 50% compared with the baseline rate during screening (75% vs. 35%; P = 0.006) than with placebo. However, the duration of attacks did not differ between placebo and rilonacept (median difference, 1.2 days [-0.5 and 2.4 days in the first and third quartiles, respectively]; P = 0.32).

A follow-up of the Harvard Growth Study of 1922 to 1935.,"BACKGROUND: Overweight in adults is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. In contrast, the long-term effect of overweight in adolescence on morbidity and mortality is not known.
METHODS: We studied the relation between overweight and morbidity and mortality in 508 lean or overweight adolescents 13 to 18 years old who participated in the Harvard Growth Study of 1922 to 1935. Overweight adolescents were defined as those with a body-mass index that on two occasions was greater than the 75th percentile in subjects of the same age and sex in a large national survey. Lean adolescents were defined as those with a body-mass index between the 25th and 50th percentiles. Subjects who were still alive were interviewed in 1988 to obtain information about their medical history, weight, functional capacity, and other risk factors. For those who had died, information on the cause of death was obtained from death certificates.
RESULTS: Overweight in adolescent subjects was associated with an increased risk of mortality from all causes and disease-specific mortality among men, but not among women. The relative risks among men were 1.8 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.2 to 2.7; P = 0.004) for mortality from all causes and 2.3 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 4.1; P = 0.002) for mortality from coronary heart disease. The risk of morbidity from coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis was increased among men and women who had been overweight in adolescence. The risk of colorectal cancer and gout was increased among men and the risk of arthritis was increased among women who had been overweight in adolescence. Overweight in adolescence was a more powerful predictor of these risks than overweight in adulthood.

This randomized clinical trial evaluated the benefit of adding a preintubation CHX dose to the known benefit of postintubation CHX to reduce the risk of early-onset VAP. A secondary aim was to test the effect of a preintubation oral application of CHX on early endotracheal tube (ETT) colonization.
METHODS: Subjects (N = 314) were recruited from two teaching hospitals and were randomly assigned to oral application of 5 mL CHX 0.12% solution before intubation (intervention group, n = 157), or to a control group (n = 157) who received no CHX before intubation. All subjects received CHX bid after intubation. Groups were compared using a repeated-measures model with Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) as the response variable. In a planned subset of subjects, ETTs were cultured at extubation.
RESULTS: Application of a preintubation dose of CHX did not provide benefit over the intervention period beyond that afforded by daily oral CHX following intubation. ETT colonization at extubation was < 20% in both groups (no statistically significant difference). Mean CPIS remained below 6 (VAP threshold score) in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Although it is feasible to deliver CHX prior to intubation (including emergent or urgent intubation), the results suggest that preintubation CHX may be inconsequential when the ventilator bundle, including daily oral CHX, is in place. During the preintubation period, providers should focus their attention on other critical activities.

METHODS: In a randomised, open-label study, 121 healthy women, 18-50 years of age, were randomly assigned to receive NOMAC/E2 (2.5 mg/1.5 mg) in a 24/4-day regimen (n=60) or LNG/EE (150 μg/30 μg) in a 21/7-day regimen (n=61) for six cycles. The primary outcome was the change from baseline to cycle 6 for all indices.
RESULTS: All parameters were similar at baseline between the two groups. Over six cycles, NOMAC/E2 had less effect on most haemostatic indices than LNG/EE. Lipids were essentially unchanged with NOMAC/E2, whereas with LNG/EE high-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides slightly increased. NOMAC/E2 induced negligible changes in glucose and insulin parameters, in contrast to LNG/EE. A much smaller increase in CRP was observed with NOMAC/E2 than with LNG/EE.

An injection of autologous blood might provide the necessary cellular and humoral mediators to induce a healing cascade. The purpose of this study was to evaluate prospectively the results of refractory lateral epicondylitis treated with autologous blood injections.
METHOD: Twenty-eight patients with lateral epicondylitis were injected with 2 mL of autologous blood under the extensor carpi radialis brevis. All patients had failed previous nonsurgical treatments including all or combinations of physical therapy, splinting, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication, and prior steroid injections. Patients kept personal logs and rated their pain (0-10) and categorized themselves according to Nirschl staging (0-7) daily.
RESULTS: The average follow-up period was 9.5 months (range, 6-24 mo). After autologous blood injections the average pain score decreased from 7.8 to 2.3. The average Nirschl stage decreased from 6.5 to 2.0. For the 9 patients receiving more than one blood injection the mean pain score and Nirschl stage before injection were 7.2 and 6.6, respectively. After the second blood injection the pain and Nirschl scores were both 0.9. Two patients received a third blood injection that brought both pain and Nirschl scores to 0.
CONCLUSIONS: After autologous blood injection therapy 22 patients (79%) in whom nonsurgical modalities had failed were relieved completely of pain even during strenuous activity.

We assessed whether NA-1 could reduce ischaemic brain damage in human beings.
METHODS: For this double-blind, randomised, controlled study, we enrolled patients aged 18 years or older who had a ruptured or unruptured intracranial aneurysm amenable to endovascular repair from 14 hospitals in Canada and the USA. We used a computer-generated randomisation sequence to allocate patients to receive an intravenous infusion of either NA-1 or saline control at the end of their endovascular procedure (1:1; stratified by site, age, and aneurysm status). Both patients and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was safety and primary clinical outcomes were the number and volume of new ischaemic strokes defined by MRI at 12-95 h after infusion. We used a modified intention-to-treat (mITT) analysis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00728182.
FINDINGS: Between Sept 16, 2008, and March 30, 2011, we randomly allocated 197 patients to treatment-12 individuals did not receive treatment because they were found to be ineligible after randomisation, so the mITT population consisted of 185 individuals, 92 in the NA-1 group and 93 in the placebo group. Two minor adverse events were adjudged to be associated with NA-1; no serious adverse events were attributable to NA-1. We recorded no difference between groups in the volume of lesions by either diffusion-weighted MRI (adjusted p value=0·120) or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI (adjusted p value=0·236). Patients in the NA-1 group sustained fewer ischaemic infarcts than did patients in the placebo group, as gauged by diffusion-weighted MRI (adjusted incidence rate ratio 0·53, 95% CI 0·38-0·74) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI (0·59, 0·42-0·83).
INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that neuroprotection in human ischaemic stroke is possible and that it should be investigated in larger trials.

The amount of fluid present in the plasma, interstitial fluid, and cellular fluid changes throughout the fetal and neonatal period, presenting a challenging situation. One of the many factors influencing fluid requirements is the insensible water loss by mechanisms such as evaporation. Low birth weight infants are especially susceptible to this due to their large body surface area and immature skin, often resulting in hypernatremia and the complications associated with it. However, some infants may experience hyperkalemia, hyperglycemia, and/or hyponatremia, resulting in various other complications.

Previous studies have suggested a benefit for memantine on agitation and aggression, but none have examined its efficacy in community-dwelling patients with significant agitation and aggression at baseline, utilizing these behaviors as a primary outcome measure.
METHODS: Patients with moderate-to-severe AD with Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) total score ≥13 and NPI agitation/aggression score ≥1 were randomized to placebo or 20-mg memantine in a double-blind, 24-week trial. Co-primary outcome measures were behavior, measured by total NPI score, and cognition, using the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB). Secondary outcome measures included global assessment, function and other measures of behavior. This trial was registered as Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00857649.
RESULTS: A total of 369 patients (average age = 75, average MMSE = 12) were randomized to placebo or memantine. The study was prematurely terminated due to recruitment problems.

This study investigated whether cigarette demand predicted response to contingent monetary rewards for abstinence among individuals with substance use disorders. It also sought to replicate evidence for greater price sensitivity at whole-dollar pack price transitions (ie, left-digit effects).
METHODS: Participants (N = 338) were individuals in residential substance use disorder treatment who participated in a randomized controlled trial that compared contingent vouchers to noncontingent vouchers for smoking abstinence. Baseline demand indices were used to predict number of abstinent days during the 14-day voucher period (after the reduction lead-in) and at 1 and 3 months afterward.
RESULTS: Demand indices correlated with measures of smoking and nicotine dependence. As measured by elasticity, intensity and O max, higher demand significantly predicted fewer abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings during voucher period for individuals in the noncontingent vouchers condition. Breakpoint exhibited a trend-level association with abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings. Demand indices did not predict abstinence in the contingent vouchers group, and did not predict abstinence at 1- and 3-month follow-ups. Left-digit price transitions were associated with significantly greater reductions in consumption.
CONCLUSIONS: The association of cigarette demand with smoking behavior only in the group for whom abstinence was not incentivized indicates that CPT assesses the value of smoking more than the value of money per se and that vouchers counteract the effects of the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes. Results provide initial short-term evidence of predictive validity for the CPT indices.
IMPLICATIONS: This study provides the first evidence of the validity of the CPT for predicting early response to brief advice for smoking cessation plus nicotine replacement in smokers with substance dependence. However, demand for cigarettes did not predict voucher-based treatment response, indicating that incentives serve as a powerful motivator not to smoke that acts in opposition to the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes and that the indices reflect the value of smoking more than the value of money per se.",1,PRIMARY,Percent Smoking Days,No Description Available,Contingency Management (CM),Noncontingent Reinforcement (NR),"Condition provides contingent monetary reinforcement for smoking reductions (first 5 days) then for smoking abstinence (subsequent 14 days).

For each phase facial actions were scored for the first 20 seconds or less if the phase lasted < 20 seconds.",18343253,"Topical amethocaine gel 4% for intramuscular injection in term neonates: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial.","BACKGROUND: Topical local anesthetic agents such as amethocaine penetrate intact skin and block pain signals originating from the dermis during medical procedures. They have been found to attenuate pain from various procedures, including intramuscular (i.m.) injection of vaccines. Published data on their effectiveness for i.m. injection of vitamin K in neonates were not identified.
OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the analgesic effectiveness and tolerability of topical amethocaine gel 4% in neonates undergoing i.m. injection of vitamin K. The secondary objective was nurses' response to the use of the intervention and possible barriers associated with its incorporation into clinical practice.
METHODS: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial, full-term neonates in the Labor and Delivery Unit of Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, received 1 g of amethocaine gel 4% or placebo 30 minutes prior to i.m. injection of 0.5 mL of vitamin K. Pain responses were assessed using percent facial grimacing score, percent cry duration, and latency to cry from video recordings. Parents and nurses assessed infants' pain response using a visual analog scale (VAS). Local adverse events (ie, erythema, blanching) at the application site were recorded. Nurses were asked to provide written responses regarding their willingness to incorporate local anesthetics in clinical practice and barriers to their use.
RESULTS: From July 2003 to December 2004, 175 families were approached for participation in the study; 52 declined consent and 13 were not randomized. One hundred ten neonates were enrolled and evenly randomized to each group. Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups. During i.m. injection, the mean (SD) percent facial grimacing score was 70% (30%) for the amethocaine group compared with 75% (34%) for the placebo group (P = 0.41). The mean (SD) for percent cry duration was 55% (34%) compared with 62% (38%), respectively (P = 0.34). The mean (SD) latency to cry was significantly longer in the amethocaine group compared with the placebo group (4.7 [4.5] vs 2.7 [2.3] seconds; P = 0.01). Parents' and nurses' VAS ratings for infant pain did not differ between groups. The incidence of adverse events did not differ between groups. Ninety-seven percent of nurses (89/92) said they would use the intervention. Fifty-seven percent of nurses (52/92) identified barriers to incorporation with the primary reason being time constraint (67% [35/52]).

METHODS: The medline, Cochrane Library, embase, cambase, and PsycInfo databases were screened through November 2011. The search strategy combined keywords for mbsr and mbct with keywords for breast cancer. Randomized controlled trials (rcts) comparing mbsr or mbct with control conditions in patients with breast cancer were included. Two authors independently used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess risk of bias in the selected studies. Study characteristics and outcomes were extracted by two authors independently. Primary outcome measures were health-related quality of life and psychological health. If at least two studies assessing an outcome were available, standardized mean differences (smds) and 95% confidence intervals (cis) were calculated for that outcome. As a measure of heterogeneity, I(2) was calculated.
RESULTS: Three rcts with a total of 327 subjects were included. One rct compared mbsr with usual care, one rct compared mbsr with free-choice stress management, and a three-arm rct compared mbsr with usual care and with nutrition education.

DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel arm, multicenter clinical trial.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 588 adult subjects with dry eye disease.
METHODS: Eligible subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive topically administered lifitegrast (5.0%) or placebo (vehicle) twice daily for 84 days after a 14-day open-label placebo run-in period. After enrollment (day 0), subjects were evaluated at days 14, 42, and 84. Key objective (fluorescein and lissamine staining scores [Ora scales]) and subjective (Ocular Surface Disease Index [OSDI], 7-item visual analog scale, and ocular discomfort score [Ora scale]) measures were assessed at all visits.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary objective efficacy measure (sign) was mean change from baseline inferior corneal staining score (ICSS) at day 84. The co-primary subjective efficacy measure (symptom) was the mean change from baseline in the visual-related function subscale score of the Ocular Surface Disease Index (VR-OSDI). Supportive measures included corneal fluorescein scores (superior, central, total region) and conjunctival lissamine scores (nasal, temporal, total region) and symptom scores at day 84.
RESULTS: The study met the primary objective efficacy ICSS end point in demonstrating superiority of lifitegrast compared with placebo (P = 0.0007).

METHOD: In a randomized controlled trial, active-duty Army soldiers at Fort Carson, Colo., who either attempted suicide or experienced suicidal ideation with intent, were randomly assigned to treatment as usual (N=76) or treatment as usual plus brief CBT (N=76). Assessment of incidence of suicide attempts during the follow-up period was conducted with the Suicide Attempt Self-Injury Interview. Inclusion criteria were the presence of suicidal ideation with intent to die during the past week and/or a suicide attempt within the past month. Soldiers were excluded if they had a medical or psychiatric condition that would prevent informed consent or participation in outpatient treatment, such as active psychosis or mania. To determine treatment efficacy with regard to incidence and time to suicide attempt, survival curve analyses were conducted. Differences in psychiatric symptoms were evaluated using longitudinal random-effects models.
RESULTS: From baseline to the 24-month follow-up assessment, eight participants in brief CBT (13.8%) and 18 participants in treatment as usual (40.2%) made at least one suicide attempt (hazard ratio=0.38, 95% CI=0.16-0.87, number needed to treat=3.88), suggesting that soldiers in brief CBT were approximately 60% less likely to make a suicide attempt during follow-up than soldiers in treatment as usual.

METHODS: In a randomised, open-label study, 121 healthy women, 18-50 years of age, were randomly assigned to receive NOMAC/E2 (2.5 mg/1.5 mg) in a 24/4-day regimen (n=60) or LNG/EE (150 μg/30 μg) in a 21/7-day regimen (n=61) for six cycles. The primary outcome was the change from baseline to cycle 6 for all indices.
RESULTS: All parameters were similar at baseline between the two groups. Over six cycles, NOMAC/E2 had less effect on most haemostatic indices than LNG/EE. Lipids were essentially unchanged with NOMAC/E2, whereas with LNG/EE high-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides slightly increased. NOMAC/E2 induced negligible changes in glucose and insulin parameters, in contrast to LNG/EE. A much smaller increase in CRP was observed with NOMAC/E2 than with LNG/EE. NOMAC/E2 was associated with a greater increase in SHBG.

In certain situations, the mismatch between this limitation and the availability of extensive information contributes to the varying performance and high error rate of clinical decision makers. Variation in clinical practice is due in part to clinicians' poor compliance with guidelines and recommended therapies. The use of decision-support tools is a response to both the information revolution and poor compliance. Computerized protocols used to deliver decision support can be configured to contain much more detail than textual guidelines or paper-based flow diagrams. Such protocols can generate patient-specific instructions for therapy that can be carried out with little interclinician variability; however, clinicians must be willing to modify personal styles of clinical management. Protocols need not be perfect. Several defensible and reasonable approaches are available for clinical problems. However, one of these reasonable approaches must be chosen and incorporated into the protocol to promote consistent clinical decisions. This reasoning is the basis of an explicit method of decision support that allows the rigorous evaluation of interventions, including use of the protocols themselves.

STUDY DESIGN: Seven hundred ninety-nine women at term with abnormal cardiotocography or meconium-stained amniotic fluid (7%) were assigned randomly to the intervention group (cardiotocography + STAN) or the control group (cardiotocography) in 2 university hospitals in Strasbourg, France. Scalp pH testing was optional in both groups. Abnormal neonatal outcome was pH <7.05 or umbilical cord blood artery base deficit of >12 or a 5-min Apgar score of <7 or neonatal intensive care unit admission or convulsions or neonatal death. Study power was 80% for the detection of a prespecified reduction from 50%-40% in operative delivery for NRFS.
RESULTS: The operative delivery (cesarean or instrumental) rate for NRFS did not differ between the 2 groups: 33.6% (134/399) in the cardiotocography + STAN analysis group vs 37% (148/400) in the cardiotocography group (relative risk, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.75-1.10).

Chronically instrumented fetal lambs were subjected to reproducible hypoxia by reduction of the maternal placental blood flow. This was achieved by complete obstruction of the maternal aorta for 60 seconds. The fetuses were divided into an immature (119 to 126 days, n = 10) and a mature group (129 to 141 days, n = 6). Both groups of fetuses had a marked fall in oxygen tension (from 2.43 +/- 0.12 to 1.46 +/- 0.12 and 2.22 +/- 0.15 to 1.11 +/- 0.17 kilopascals [kPa] in the immature and mature groups, respectively) and in oxygen saturation (from 48% +/- 3% to 17% +/- 2% and 49% +/- 3% to 15% +/- 3%, respectively), but only modest changes occurred in pH and carbon dioxide tension. Basal fetal catecholamine concentrations did not differ between the groups but increased more significantly in the mature group with acute hypoxia. An increase in the T wave amplitude of the fetal electrocardiogram occurred in both groups during the latter part of occlusion with peak values shortly after removal of the occlusion. A linear correlation was found between the plasma epinephrine concentration and the T/QRS ratio in the mature group. Fetuses in both groups showed a marked bradycardia of similar magnitude during the occlusion but differed during the early phase of heart rate recovery by a slower acceleration of heart rate in the mature group. In connection with this marked bradycardia, the mature group showed a significant rise in mean arterial blood pressure at end of the occlusion. We suggest that fetal maturity has a significant influence no only on the release of catecholamines during nonacidemic hypoxia but also on the cardiovascular reaction pattern and changes in the ST waveform.",2,PRIMARY,Number of Infants With Apgar Score < = 3 at 5 Minutes (Primary Outcome Component),"The Apgar score is a simple method of quickly assessing the health and vital signs of a newborn baby created by and named after Dr. Virginia Apgar.

We tested whether varenicline, a partial nicotine agonist, would also increase future quit attempts.
METHODS: This randomized, placebo-controlled trial recruited 218 smokers who were interested in quitting but had no plans to quit in the next month. Participants used varenicline (2 mg/day) or placebo for 2-8 weeks plus received brief counseling on methods to reduce cigarettes/day. The primary measure was the incidence of a quit attempt within 6 months of study entry. Secondary measures were point prevalence abstinence, motivation to stop smoking, and reduction in cigarettes/day.
RESULTS: Varenicline increased the incidence of a quit attempt more than placebo at the Nebraska site (73% vs. 41%; p < .001) but not at the Vermont site (45% vs. 51%; p = .45). Varenicline increased most other measures of quit attempts, motivation and abstinence, independent of site. The beneficial effects of varenicline in quit attempts appeared to be mediated by greater reductions in cigarettes/day, dependence, craving, and cigarette satisfaction. Varenicline had a greater effect on quit attempts in less-dependent smokers, in minority smokers, and in those who had less prior cessation or reduction activity. Adverse events were minimal.

In the postoperative period, 32.5% of patients had a hematocrit of 26-30, and 26.5% had a hematocrit of 21-25. Mean units of blood transfused in the perioperative period ranged from 0.1 +/- 0.9 in patients without anemia to 2.7 +/- 2.9 in those with anemia. Incidence of pneumonia increased from 2.6 to 5% with increasing degree of anemia. Multiple logistic regression analysis documented that low preoperative hematocrit, low postoperative hematocrit, and increased blood transfusion rates were associated with increased mortality (P < 0.01), increased postoperative pneumonia (P < or = 0.05), and increased hospital length of stay (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: There is a high incidence of preoperative and postoperative anemia in surgical patients, with a coincident increase in blood utilization. These factors are associated with increased risk for perioperative infection and adverse outcome (mortality) in surgical patients.

Saline-coupled Bipolar Sealer: The Aquamantys® System is a commercially available device used routinely used in the operating room for a wide variety of surgical cases. It allows for temperatures to stay at approximately 100°C, nearly 200°C less than conventional devices, which produces a tissue effect without the charring associated with other methods. The temperature is sufficient to shrink collagen fibers in the walls of blood vessels, effectively sealing the blood vessels, resulting in the reduction in bleeding from both soft tissue and bone. The device can be used to spot coagulate vessels that are actively bleeding or to broadly paint tissue surfaces to prevent bleeding or treat active oozing.","Unipolar electrocautery

Time point of measurement: 20 min after the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).,26525271,Predictive value of interleukin-6 in post-cardiac arrest patients treated with targeted temperature management at 33 °C or 36 °C.,"AIM: Post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS) is characterized by systemic inflammation, however data on the prognostic value of inflammatory markers is sparse. We sought to investigate the importance of systemic inflammation, assessed by interleukin-6 (IL-6) in comatose survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
METHODS: A total of 682 patients enrolled in the Target Temperature Management (TTM) trial, surviving >24h with available IL-6 data were included. IL-6 was measured on days 1, 2 and 3 after return of spontaneous circulation. Severity of PCAS was assessed daily by the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score. Survival status was recorded at 30 days.
RESULTS: High levels of IL-6 at day 1-3 (all p<0.0001) were independently associated with severity of PCAS with no interaction of target temperature (all p=NS). IL-6 levels did not differ between temperature groups (p(interaction)=0.99). IL-6 levels at day 2 (p<0.0001) and day 3 (p<0.0001) were associated with crude mortality. Adjusted Cox proportional-hazards analysis showed that a two-fold increase of IL-6 levels at day 2 (HR=1.15 (95% CI: 1.07-1.23), p=0.0002) and day 3 (HR=1.18 (95% CI: 1.09-1.27), p<0.0001) were associated with mortality. IL-6 levels at day 3 had the highest discriminative value in predicting mortality (AUC=0.66). IL-6 did not significantly improve 30-day mortality prediction compared to traditional prognostic factors (p=0.08).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients surviving >24h following cardiac arrest, IL-6 levels were significantly elevated and associated with severity of PCAS with no significant influence of target temperature. High IL-6 levels were associated with increased mortality.

METHODS: A total of 317 patients from four Level I trauma centers with penetrating abdominal injuries and at least one hollow viscus perforation each received one preoperative and three postoperative doses of ampicillin/sulbactam 3 g intravenously. After receiving 24 hours of unblinded ampicillin/sulbactam, patients were then randomized into one of two groups. Group 1 received 4 additional days of blinded ampicillin/sulbactam (5 days total of antibiotic), and Group 2 received 4 days of placebo (24 hours of antibiotic). Patients were assessed postoperatively for occurrence of deep surgical-site infections (intra-abdominal abscess, fasciitis, and peritonitis) and superficial (wound) surgical-site infections. Development of nonsurgical-site infections (e.g., pneumonia, urinary tract infection, phlebitis, and cellulitis) was also recorded. Continuous variables were analyzed by analysis of variance and discrete variables by the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel chi2 test. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were also performed to identify independent risk factors for postoperative infection.
RESULTS: A total of 159 patients were randomized into Group 1, and 158 patients were randomized into Group 2.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to document immune responses to cockroach allergen and provide direction for the development of immunotherapy for cockroach allergy.
METHODS: Four pilot studies were conducted: (1) an open-label study to assess the safety of cockroach sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) in adults and children; (2) a randomized, double-blind biomarker study of cockroach SLIT versus placebo in adults; (3) a randomized, double-blind biomarker study of 2 doses of cockroach SLIT versus placebo in children; and (4) an open-label safety and biomarker study of cockroach subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) in adults.
RESULTS: The adult SLIT trial (n = 54; age, 18-54 years) found a significantly greater increase in cockroach-specific IgE levels between the active and placebo groups (geometric mean ratio, 1.92; P < .0001) and a trend toward increased cockroach-specific IgG4 levels in actively treated subjects (P = .09) but no evidence of functional blocking antibody response.

In the SCIT study the treatment resulted in significant changes from baseline in cockroach IgE, IgG4, and blocking antibody levels. The safety profile of cockroach immunotherapy was reassuring in all studies.
CONCLUSIONS: The administration of cockroach allergen by means of SCIT is immunologically more active than SLIT, especially with regard to IgG4 levels and blocking antibody responses.

Research with animal and human cell lines provide plausible support for these claims. Poor absorption results in low systemic bioavailability of EGCG after oral administration but high colonic mucosal exposure.
METHODS: Patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis (UC) were randomized to daily doses of oral Polyphenon E (400 mg or 800 mg of total EGCG daily, administered in split doses) or placebo in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled pilot study. Response was measured by the UC disease activity index and the inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire on day 56.
RESULTS: Twenty patients were randomized to active therapy or placebo in a 4:1 ratio. Nineteen subjects received >1 dose of study medication (15 Polyphenon E, 4 placebo). The mean UC disease activity index score at study entry was 6.5 ± 1.9 in the treatment group and 7.3 ± 1.7 in the placebo group.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A randomized controlled 3-month trial was conducted with two post-treatment assessments of 200 breast cancer survivors assigned to either 12 weeks of 90-minute twice per week hatha yoga classes or a wait-list control. The main outcome measures were lipopolysaccharide-stimulated production of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and scores on the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF), the vitality scale from the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form (SF-36), and the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale.
RESULTS: Immediately post-treatment, fatigue was not lower (P > .05) but vitality was higher (P = .01) in the yoga group compared with the control group. At 3 months post-treatment, fatigue was lower in the yoga group (P = .002), vitality was higher (P = .01), and IL-6 (P = .027), TNF-α (P = .027), and IL-1β (P = .037) were lower for yoga participants compared with the control group. Groups did not differ on depression at either time (P > .2). Planned secondary analyses showed that the frequency of yoga practice had stronger associations with fatigue at both post-treatment visits (P = .019; P < .001), as well as vitality (P = .016; P = .0045), but not depression (P > .05) than simple group assignment; more frequent practice produced larger changes. At 3 months post-treatment, increasing yoga practice also led to a decrease in IL-6 (P = .01) and IL-1β (P = .03) production but not in TNF-α production (P > .05).

METHODS: We performed a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, adaptive, phase 2-3 trial assessing the efficacy and safety of a pediatric-specific oral propranolol solution in infants 1 to 5 months of age with proliferating infantile hemangioma requiring systemic therapy. Infants were randomly assigned to receive placebo or one of four propranolol regimens (1 or 3 mg of propranolol base per kilogram of body weight per day for 3 or 6 months). A preplanned interim analysis was conducted to identify the regimen to study for the final efficacy analysis. The primary end point was success (complete or nearly complete resolution of the target hemangioma) or failure of trial treatment at week 24, as assessed by independent, centralized, blinded evaluations of standardized photographs.
RESULTS: Of 460 infants who underwent randomization, 456 received treatment. On the basis of an interim analysis of the first 188 patients who completed 24 weeks of trial treatment, the regimen of 3 mg of propranolol per kilogram per day for 6 months was selected for the final efficacy analysis. The frequency of successful treatment was higher with this regimen than with placebo (60% vs. 4%, P<0.001). A total of 88% of patients who received the selected propranolol regimen showed improvement by week 5, versus 5% of patients who received placebo. A total of 10% of patients in whom treatment with propranolol was successful required systemic retreatment during follow-up. Known adverse events associated with propranolol (hypoglycemia, hypotension, bradycardia, and bronchospasm) occurred infrequently, with no significant difference in frequency between the placebo group and the groups receiving propranolol.

A prognosis marker of early infectious and non-infectious postoperative complications.,"BACKGROUND: Elevated procalcitonin (PCT) levels are observed after major surgery, such as orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTx). The aim of this observational study was to evaluate PCT kinetics during the first 5 following days after surgery to establish the prognostic value of PCT changes in the outcome of OLTx, and to predict medical, technical and infectious complications. PCT was also evaluated in the differential diagnosis of infection vs. rejection.
METHODS: A total of 64 OLTx were performed in 58 patients; they were split into two groups: with and without complications. Out of these patients, 18 developed infection, and nine rejection. PCT was measured before and during surgery, 12 h after transplantation and daily for the 5 following days. PCT was also measured the day when infection or rejection was diagnosed, and on the previous day. PCT was determined by time-resolved amplified cryptate emission (TRACE) technology.
RESULTS: PCT elevation began at 12 h after surgery, reaching a peak on the 1st day in both groups. Significantly higher PCT concentrations were found in the group of patients developing complications, on the 5 postoperative days. It was found that a 24 h PCT value higher than 1.92 microg/L increased by 9.1-time-fold the risk of complications.

Toward Your Goals is superior to Arm 2: Receiving Enhanced Usual Care in terms of Weight Change (kg) 6 Months,27716279,Adapting a weight management tool for Latina women: a usability study of the Veteran Health Administration's MOVE!23 tool.,"BACKGROUND: Obesity disproportionately affects Latina women, but few targeted, technology-assisted interventions that incorporate tailored health information exist for this population. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) uses an online weight management tool (MOVE!23) which is publicly available, but was not designed for use in non-VHA populations.
METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study to determine how interactions between the tool and other contextual elements impacted task performance when the target Latina users interacted with MOVE!23. We sought to identify and classify specific facilitators and barriers that might inform design changes to the tool and its context of use, and in turn promote usability. Six English-speaking, adult Latinas were recruited from an inner city primary care clinic and a nursing program at a local university in the United States to engage in a ""Think-Aloud"" protocol while using MOVE!23. Sessions were recorded, transcribed, and coded to identify interactions between four factors that contribute to usability (Tool, Task, User, Context).
RESULTS: Five themes influencing usability were identified: Technical Ability and Technology Preferences; Language Confusion and Ambiguity; Supportive Tool Design and Facilitator Guidance; Relevant Examples; and Personal Experience. Features of the tool, task, and other contextual factors failed to fully support participants at times, impeding task completion. Participants interacted with the tool more readily when its language was familiar and content was personally relevant. When faced with ambiguity and uncertainty, they relied on the tool's visual cues and examples, actively sought relevant personal experiences, and/or requested facilitator support.
CONCLUSIONS: The ability of our participants to successfully use the tool was influenced by the interaction of individual characteristics with those of the tool and other contextual factors. We identified both tool-specific and context-related changes that could overcome barriers to the use of MOVE!23 among Latinas.

METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving patients who were unable or unwilling to take statins owing to unacceptable adverse effects (""statin-intolerant"" patients) and had, or were at high risk for, cardiovascular disease. The patients were assigned to receive oral bempedoic acid, 180 mg daily, or placebo. The primary end point was a four-component composite of major adverse cardiovascular events, defined as death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or coronary revascularization.
RESULTS: A total of 13,970 patients underwent randomization; 6992 were assigned to the bempedoic acid group and 6978 to the placebo group. The median duration of follow-up was 40.6 months. The mean LDL cholesterol level at baseline was 139.0 mg per deciliter in both groups, and after 6 months, the reduction in the level was greater with bempedoic acid than with placebo by 29.2 mg per deciliter; the observed difference in the percent reductions was 21.1 percentage points in favor of bempedoic acid.

METHODS: This was a multinational, prospective, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group trial. Patients with Stage IV PAOD were equally randomised to either 4 weeks of alprostadil treatment twice daily or to placebo treatment twice daily. The primary efficacy variables were the rate of complete healing of all necrosis and ulceration 12 weeks after the end of treatment and the frequency of major amputations 24 weeks after the end of treatment.
RESULTS: A total of 840 patients were randomised between 2004 and 2013. At baseline, no major differences between treatment groups were found. The rate of ""complete healing"" was 18.4% in patients on alprostadil and 17.2% in patients on placebo. The rates of ""major amputations"" were 12.6% in patients on alprostadil and 14.6% in patients on placebo.

SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: The Shiprock and Tsaile/Chinle areas in the Navajo Nation were selected. Elementary schools were screened for eligibility. All students in third and fourth grades were invited to participate in the assessments.
INTERVENTION: Delivered during 1 school year in the intervention schools, the intervention included a culturally relevant nutrition and gardening curriculum and a school garden.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Student self-efficacy for eating fruits and vegetables, student self-efficacy for gardening, and student healthy foods score from a modified Alternative Healthy Eating Index were assessed in third and fourth graders at the beginning and end of a school year affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Primary analyses used repeated measures linear mixed models accounting for students nested within schools to estimate the intervention effect and 95% CIs.
RESULTS: Students in the intervention schools had self-efficacy scores for eating fruits and vegetables that were 0.22 points greater (95% CI=0.04, 0.41) than those in the comparison schools, although the student healthy foods score increased in the intervention schools by 2.0 (95% CI=0.4, 3.6); the differential change was modest at 1.7 (95% CI=-0.3, 3.7). The self-efficacy to grow fruits and vegetables in the school garden increased among those in the intervention schools (OR=1.92; 95% CI=1.02, 3.63) but not significantly more than it increased in the comparison schools (OR=1.29; 95% CI=0.60, 2.81).
CONCLUSIONS: The intervention was efficacious in improving self-efficacy for eating fruits and vegetables among third- and fourth-grade students over a school year. The findings warrant further evaluation of the intervention in larger-group randomized trials with schools in Navajo communities.

Physical inactivity is a primary cause of most chronic diseases. The initial third of the article considers: activity and prevention definitions; historical evidence showing physical inactivity is detrimental to health and normal organ functional capacities; cause versus treatment; physical activity and inactivity mechanisms differ; gene-environment interaction (including aerobic training adaptations, personalized medicine, and co-twin physical activity); and specificity of adaptations to type of training. Next, physical activity/exercise is examined as primary prevention against 35 chronic conditions [accelerated biological aging/premature death, low cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max), sarcopenia, metabolic syndrome, obesity, insulin resistance, prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, coronary heart disease, peripheral artery disease, hypertension, stroke, congestive heart failure, endothelial dysfunction, arterial dyslipidemia, hemostasis, deep vein thrombosis, cognitive dysfunction, depression and anxiety, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, balance, bone fracture/falls, rheumatoid arthritis, colon cancer, breast cancer, endometrial cancer, gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, polycystic ovary syndrome, erectile dysfunction, pain, diverticulitis, constipation, and gallbladder diseases]. The article ends with consideration of deterioration of risk factors in longer-term sedentary groups; clinical consequences of inactive childhood/adolescence; and public policy. In summary, the body rapidly maladapts to insufficient physical activity, and if continued, results in substantial decreases in both total and quality years of life.

This study investigated whether cigarette demand predicted response to contingent monetary rewards for abstinence among individuals with substance use disorders. It also sought to replicate evidence for greater price sensitivity at whole-dollar pack price transitions (ie, left-digit effects).
METHODS: Participants (N = 338) were individuals in residential substance use disorder treatment who participated in a randomized controlled trial that compared contingent vouchers to noncontingent vouchers for smoking abstinence. Baseline demand indices were used to predict number of abstinent days during the 14-day voucher period (after the reduction lead-in) and at 1 and 3 months afterward.
RESULTS: Demand indices correlated with measures of smoking and nicotine dependence. As measured by elasticity, intensity and O max, higher demand significantly predicted fewer abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings during voucher period for individuals in the noncontingent vouchers condition. Breakpoint exhibited a trend-level association with abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings. Demand indices did not predict abstinence in the contingent vouchers group, and did not predict abstinence at 1- and 3-month follow-ups. Left-digit price transitions were associated with significantly greater reductions in consumption.
CONCLUSIONS: The association of cigarette demand with smoking behavior only in the group for whom abstinence was not incentivized indicates that CPT assesses the value of smoking more than the value of money per se and that vouchers counteract the effects of the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes. Results provide initial short-term evidence of predictive validity for the CPT indices.
IMPLICATIONS: This study provides the first evidence of the validity of the CPT for predicting early response to brief advice for smoking cessation plus nicotine replacement in smokers with substance dependence. However, demand for cigarettes did not predict voucher-based treatment response, indicating that incentives serve as a powerful motivator not to smoke that acts in opposition to the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes and that the indices reflect the value of smoking more than the value of money per se.",0,PRIMARY,Number of Participants Smoking Abstinent in Past 7 Days,7 -day smoking cessation confirmed by expired alveolar CO levels of \< 10 ppm or salivary cotinine \< 16 ng/ml.,Contingency Management (CM),Noncontingent Reinforcement (NR),"Condition provides contingent monetary reinforcement for smoking reductions (first 5 days) then for smoking abstinence (subsequent 14 days).

We tested this assumption for patients undergoing percutaneous vascular and renal procedures in a prospective, randomised, single-centre study.
METHODS: 241 patients were randomised to receive intraoperatively standard care (n=79), structured attention (n=80), or self-hypnotic relaxation (n=82). All had access to patient-controlled intravenous analgesia with fentanyl and midazolam. Patients rated their pain and anxiety on 0-10 scales before, every 15 min during and after the procedures.
FINDINGS: Pain increased linearly with procedure time in the standard group (slope 0.09 in pain score/15 min, p<0.0001), and the attention group (slope 0.04/15 min; p=0.0425), but remained flat in the hypnosis group. Anxiety decreased over time in all three groups with slopes of -0.04 (standard), -0.07 (attention), and -0.11 (hypnosis). Drug use in the standard group (1.9 units) was significantly higher than in the attention and hypnosis groups (0.8 and 0.9 units, respectively). One hypnosis patient became haemodynamically unstable compared with ten attention patients (p=0.0041), and 12 standard patients (p=0.0009). Procedure times were significantly shorter in the hypnosis group (61 min) than in the standard group (78 min, p=0.0016) with procedure duration of the attention group in between (67 min).
INTERPRETATION: Structured attention and self-hypnotic relaxation proved beneficial during invasive medical procedures. Hypnosis had more pronounced effects on pain and anxiety reduction, and is superior, in that it also improves haemodynamic stability.",2,PRIMARY,Equipment Utilization in Q3FY16 (OSU),Quarterly completion rate of MRIs as a proportion of scans completed per given number of imaging slots available,Comfort Talk® Training OSU,Control OSU,"Three MRI clinical sites form the experimental group at OSU in a randomized assignment.

METHODS: Full RECOVER trial methodological details have already been reported. The post hoc analyses presented here are done on individual items of the PDSS-2 and PDQ-8 for all patients and two subgroups (baseline symptomatic and highly symptomatic patients).
RESULTS: Ten PDSS-2 and five PDQ-8 items show significant mean treatment difference versus placebo. In the overall population, items that most favor rotigotine in percentage of patients with improvement are 'limb pain causes waking' and 'uncomfortable in bed due to immobility' for PDSS-2; for PDQ-8, rotigotine is most favored in 'difficulty dressing', 'felt depressed' and 'difficulty getting around in public'. Among symptomatic and highly symptomatic patients, the PDSS-2 items that most favor rotigotine are both indicators of pain. On the PDQ-8, the two items most favored in symptomatic patients are 'difficulty dressing' and 'embarrassed in public due to PD', and in the highly symptomatic subgroup 'difficulty dressing' and 'difficulty getting around in public'.

DESIGN: Prospective.
SETTING: University-affiliated, pediatric medical center.
PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred ninety-four children.
INTERVENTIONS: Coagulation tests.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Demographic, coagulation test, blood loss, and transfusion data were noted in consecutive children undergoing cardiac surgery. Laboratory tests included hematocrit (Hct), prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time (PTT), platelet count, fibrinogen concentration, and thromboelastography. Stepwise linear regression analysis indicated that platelet count during CPB was the variable most significantly associated with intraoperative blood loss (in milliliters per kilogram) and 12-hour chest tube output (in milliliters per kilogram). Other independent variables associated with blood loss were thromboelastography maximum amplitude (MA) during CPB, preoperative PTT, preoperative Hct, and preoperative thromboelastography angle and shear modulus values. Thromboelastography MA during CPB was the only variable associated with total products transfused (in milliliters per kilogram). Of all tests studied, platelet count during CPB (< or = 108,000/microL) provided the maximum sensitivity (83%) and specificity (58%) for prediction of excessive blood loss (receiver operating characteristic analysis). Blood loss was inversely related to patient age; neonates received the most donor units (median, 8 units; range, 6 to 10 units).
CONCLUSIONS: During cardiac surgery, coagulation tests (including thromboelastography) drawn pre-CPB and during CPB are useful to identify children at risk for excessive bleeding.

Patients recorded respiratory symptoms daily and reported exacerbations to the outpatient-based study team or to their primary care physician; 1,099 exacerbations were recorded by the patients, of which 658 were reported to a physician. The time between exacerbation onset and treatment was a median (interquartile range) of 3.69 (2.0-5.57) days, and the exacerbation recovery time was 10.7 (7.0-14.0) days.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A randomized controlled 3-month trial was conducted with two post-treatment assessments of 200 breast cancer survivors assigned to either 12 weeks of 90-minute twice per week hatha yoga classes or a wait-list control. The main outcome measures were lipopolysaccharide-stimulated production of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and scores on the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF), the vitality scale from the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form (SF-36), and the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale.
RESULTS: Immediately post-treatment, fatigue was not lower (P > .05) but vitality was higher (P = .01) in the yoga group compared with the control group. At 3 months post-treatment, fatigue was lower in the yoga group (P = .002), vitality was higher (P = .01), and IL-6 (P = .027), TNF-α (P = .027), and IL-1β (P = .037) were lower for yoga participants compared with the control group.

""The ASSUAGE trial"".","BACKGROUND: It is unknown whether the standardized intravenous aminophylline administration following regadenoson-stress can prevent the gastrointestinal and other adverse effects associated with regadenoson.
METHODS: In a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial we compared the frequency and severity of regadenoson adverse effects in those who received 75 mg of intravenous aminophylline versus a matching placebo administered 2 minutes after regadenoson or 90 seconds post-radioisotope injection.
RESULTS: 248 patients [44.8% women, mean age 62.2 (± 13.3) years] were randomized to receive aminophylline (124) or placebo (124).

It is uncertain whether AF is associated with excess mortality independent of associated cardiac conditions and risk factors.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined the mortality of subjects 55 to 94 years of age who developed AF during 40 years of follow-up of the original Framingham Heart Study cohort. Of the original 5209 subjects, 296 men and 325 women (mean ages, 74 and 76 years, respectively) developed AF and met eligibility criteria. By pooled logistic regression, after adjustment for age, hypertension, smoking, diabetes, left ventricular hypertrophy, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, valvular heart disease, and stroke or transient ischemic attack, AF was associated with an OR for death of 1.5 (95% CI, 1.2 to 1.8) in men and 1.9 (95% CI, 1.5 to 2.2) in women. The risk of mortality conferred by AF did not significantly vary by age. However, there was a significant AF-sex interaction: AF diminished the female advantage in survival. In secondary multivariate analyses, in subjects free of valvular heart disease and preexisting cardiovascular disease, AF remained significantly associated with excess mortality, with about a doubling of mortality in both sexes.
CONCLUSIONS: In subjects from the original cohort of the Framingham Heart Study, AF was associated with a 1.5- to 1.9-fold mortality risk after adjustment for the preexisting cardiovascular conditions with which AF was related.

We hypothesized this was due to ART-associated immune pathology, without clinically recognized immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome.
METHODS: Three macrophage activation markers and 19 cytokines/chemokines were measured from cryopreserved cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum during the Cryptococcal Optimal ART Timing (COAT) trial. Comparisons were made between trial arms (early vs deferred) at 1, 8, 14, and 21 days following meningitis diagnosis.
RESULTS: More participants with early ART initiation had CSF white cell count (WCC) ≥5/µL at day 14 (58% vs 40%; P = .047), after a median of 6-days ART. Differences were mainly driven by participants with CSF WCC <5/µL at meningitis diagnosis: 28% (10/36) of such persons in the early ART group had CSF WCC ≥5/µL by day 14, compared with 0% (0/27) in the deferred arm (P = .002). Furthermore, Kampala participants (the largest site) receiving early ART had higher day-14 CSF levels of interleukin-13 (P = .04), sCD14 (P = .04), sCD163 (P = .02), and CCL3/MIP-1α (P = .02), suggesting increased macrophage/microglial activation.
CONCLUSIONS: Early ART initiation in cryptococcal meningitis increased CSF cellular infiltrate, macrophage/microglial activation, and T helper 2 responses within the central nervous system. This suggests that increased mortality from early ART in the COAT trial was immunologically mediated.",2,PRIMARY,Mortality,Intention to treat analysis of 26 week survival of all subjects enrolled.

MEASUREMENTS: Urinalysis and self-reports of substance use and 12-step attendance and activities.
INTERVENTION: Group sessions focused on increasing acceptance of 12-step principles; individual sessions incorporated an intensive referral procedure connecting participants to 12-step volunteers.
FINDINGS: Compared with TAU, STAGE-12 participants had significantly greater odds of self-reported stimulant abstinence during the active 8-week treatment phase; however, among those who had not achieved abstinence during this period, STAGE-12 participants had more days of use.

These abnormalities are thought to reflect a deficiency in the synchronization of pyramidal cell activity that is dependent, in part, on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission through GABA type A (GABA(A)) receptors containing alpha(2) subunits. The authors conducted a proof-of-concept clinical trial designed to test the hypothesis that a novel compound with relatively selective agonist activity at GABA(A) receptors containing alpha(2) subunits would improve cognitive function and gamma band oscillations in individuals with schizophrenia.
METHOD: Participants were male subjects (N=15) with chronic schizophrenia who were randomly assigned to receive 4 weeks of treatment with the study drug MK-0777, a benzodiazepine-like agent with selective activity at GABA(A) receptors containing alpha(2) or alpha(3) subunits, or a matched placebo in a double-blind fashion. Outcome measures were the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status, three tests of working memory and/or cognitive control (N-back, AX Continuous Performance Test, and Preparing to Overcome Prepotency), and EEG measures of gamma band oscillations induced during the Preparing to Overcome Prepotency task.
RESULTS: Compared with placebo, the MK-0777 compound was associated with improved performance on the N-back, AX Continuous Performance Test, and Preparing to Overcome Prepotency tasks. The compound was also associated with increased frontal gamma band power during the Preparing to Overcome Prepotency task. No effects of the MK-0777 compound were detected in BPRS or Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status scores, with the exception of improvement on the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status delayed memory index.

Catheter ablation has been proposed as an alternative treatment for paroxysmal AF.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of catheter ablation compared with antiarrhythmic drug therapy (ADT) in treating symptomatic paroxysmal AF.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A prospective, multicenter, randomized (2:1), unblinded, Bayesian-designed study conducted at 19 hospitals of 167 patients who did not respond to at least 1 antiarrhythmic drug and who experienced at least 3 AF episodes within 6 months before randomization. Enrollment occurred between October 25, 2004, and October 11, 2007, with the last follow-up on January 19, 2009.
INTERVENTION: Catheter ablation (n = 106) or ADT (n = 61), with assessment for effectiveness in a comparable 9-month follow-up period.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Time to protocol-defined treatment failure. The proportion of patients who experienced major treatment-related adverse events within 30 days of catheter ablation or ADT was also reported.
RESULTS: At the end of the 9-month effectiveness evaluation period, 66% of patients in the catheter ablation group remained free from protocol-defined treatment failure compared with 16% of patients treated with ADT. The hazard ratio of catheter ablation to ADT was 0.30 (95% confidence interval, 0.19-0.47; P < .001). Major 30-day treatment-related adverse events occurred in 5 of 57 patients (8.8%) treated with ADT and 5 of 103 patients (4.9%) treated with catheter ablation. Mean quality of life scores improved significantly in patients treated by catheter ablation compared with ADT at 3 months; improvement was maintained during the course of the study.
CONCLUSION: Among patients with paroxysmal AF who had not responded to at least 1 antiarrhythmic drug, the use of catheter ablation compared with ADT resulted in a longer time to treatment failure during the 9-month follow-up period.

This study investigated whether cigarette demand predicted response to contingent monetary rewards for abstinence among individuals with substance use disorders. It also sought to replicate evidence for greater price sensitivity at whole-dollar pack price transitions (ie, left-digit effects).
METHODS: Participants (N = 338) were individuals in residential substance use disorder treatment who participated in a randomized controlled trial that compared contingent vouchers to noncontingent vouchers for smoking abstinence. Baseline demand indices were used to predict number of abstinent days during the 14-day voucher period (after the reduction lead-in) and at 1 and 3 months afterward.
RESULTS: Demand indices correlated with measures of smoking and nicotine dependence. As measured by elasticity, intensity and O max, higher demand significantly predicted fewer abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings during voucher period for individuals in the noncontingent vouchers condition. Breakpoint exhibited a trend-level association with abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings. Demand indices did not predict abstinence in the contingent vouchers group, and did not predict abstinence at 1- and 3-month follow-ups. Left-digit price transitions were associated with significantly greater reductions in consumption.
CONCLUSIONS: The association of cigarette demand with smoking behavior only in the group for whom abstinence was not incentivized indicates that CPT assesses the value of smoking more than the value of money per se and that vouchers counteract the effects of the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes. Results provide initial short-term evidence of predictive validity for the CPT indices.
IMPLICATIONS: This study provides the first evidence of the validity of the CPT for predicting early response to brief advice for smoking cessation plus nicotine replacement in smokers with substance dependence. However, demand for cigarettes did not predict voucher-based treatment response, indicating that incentives serve as a powerful motivator not to smoke that acts in opposition to the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes and that the indices reflect the value of smoking more than the value of money per se.",0,PRIMARY,Number of Participants With Relapse to Any Drug Use,No Description Available,Contingency Management (CM),Noncontingent Reinforcement (NR),"Condition provides contingent monetary reinforcement for smoking reductions (first 5 days) then for smoking abstinence (subsequent 14 days).

METHODS AND RESULTS: OSICAT was a randomised, multicentre, open-label French study in 937 patients hospitalised for acute HF ≤12 months before inclusion. Patients were randomised to telemonitoring (daily body weight measurement, daily recording of HF symptoms, and personalised education) (n = 482) or to SC (n = 455). Mean ± standard deviation number of events for the primary outcome was 1.30 ± 1.85 for telemonitoring and 1.46 ± 1.98 for SC [rate ratio 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77-1.23; P = 0.80]. In New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV HF, median time to all-cause death or first unplanned hospitalisation was 82 days in the telemonitoring group and 67 days in the SC group (P = 0.03). After adjustment for known predictive factors, telemonitoring was associated with a 21% relative risk reduction in first unplanned hospitalisation for HF [hazard ratio (HR) 0.79, 95% CI 0.62-0.99; P = 0.044); the relative risk reduction was 29% in patients with NYHA class III or IV HF (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.53-0.95; P = 0.02), 38% in socially isolated patients (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.39-0.98; P = 0.043), and 37% in patients who were ≥70% adherent to body weight measurement (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.45-0.88; P = 0.006).

Changing Professional Practice in Europe Group (EU BIOMED II Concerted Action).,"OBJECTIVES: Cluster randomised trials, in which groups of individuals are randomised, are increasingly being used in the health field. Adopting a clustered approach has implications for the design of such trials, and sample size calculations need to be inflated to accommodate for the clustering effect. Reliable estimates of intracluster correlation coefficients (ICCs) are required for robust sample size calculations to be made; however, little empirical evidence is available on their likely size, and on factors which influence their magnitude. The aim of this study was to generate empirical estimates of ICCs and to explore factors which may affect their magnitude.
METHODS: Empirical estimates of ICCs were calculated for both process variables and patient outcomes from a number of datasets of primary and secondary care implementation studies.
RESULTS: Estimates of ICCs varied according to setting and type of outcome. Estimates of ICCs for process variables were higher than those for patient outcomes, and estimates derived from secondary care were higher than those from primary care. ICCs for process variables in primary care were of the order of 0.05-0.15, whilst those in secondary care were of the order of 0.3. Estimates for patient outcomes in primary care were generally lower than 0.05.
CONCLUSIONS: Adopting cluster randomisation has implications for the design, size and analysis of clinical trials.

METHODS: A validated self-administered headache questionnaire was mailed to 120,000 US households, representative of the US population. Migraineurs were identified according to the criteria of the second edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders. Guidelines for preventive medication use were developed by a panel of headache experts. Criteria for consider or offer prevention were based on headache frequency and impairment.
RESULTS: We assessed 162,576 individuals aged 12 years or older. The 1-year period prevalence for migraine was 11.7% (17.1% in women and 5.6% in men). Prevalence peaked in middle life and was lower in adolescents and those older than age 60 years.

This study is an initial evaluation of adding cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) to the antidepressant medication escitalopram (EsCIT) in individuals with both disorders.
DESIGN AND SETTING: A randomized, controlled, pilot study in a single academic medical center.
PARTICIPANTS: 30 individuals (61% female, mean age 35 +/- 18) with MDD and insomnia.
INTERVENTIONS: EsCIT and 7 individual therapy sessions of CBTI or CTRL (quasi-desensitization).
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Depression was assessed with the HRSD17 and the depression portion of the SCID, administered by raters masked to treatment assignment, at baseline and after 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment. The primary outcome was remission of MDD at study exit, which required both an HRSD17 score < or =7 and absence of the 2 core symptoms of MDD. Sleep was assessed with the insomnia severity index (ISI), daily sleep diaries, and actigraphy. EsCIT + CBTI resulted in a higher rate of remission of depression (61.5%) than EsCIT + CTRL (33.3%). EsCIT + CBTI was also associated with a greater remission from insomnia (50.0%) than EsCIT + CTRL (7.7%) and larger improvement in all diary and actigraphy measures of sleep, except for total sleep time.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of a needling device for treatment of acne scars.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We performed a single-center, rater-blinded, balanced (1:1), split-face, placebo-controlled, parallel-group randomized clinical trial at an urban academic institution. The study took place from November 30, 2009, through July 27, 2010. Twenty healthy adults (age range, 20-65 years) with acne scars on both sides of the face were enrolled. Fifteen individuals completed the study, and no enrolled participants were withdrawn for adverse effects.
INTERVENTIONS: For each participant, one side of the face was randomized for needling. Three needling treatments were performed at 2-week intervals.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Two blinded dermatologists separately rated participants' acne scars based on standard digital photographs obtained at baseline and at the 3-month and 6-month follow-up visits on the quantitative global scarring grading system.
RESULTS: Mean scar scores were significantly lower in the treatment group compared with baseline at 6 months (mean difference, 3.4; 95% CI, 0.2-6.5; P = .03) and nominally but not significantly lower compared with baseline at 3 months (mean difference, 2.4; 95% CI, -0.01 to 4.8; P = .052). In the control group, mean scar scores did not vary significantly from baseline at 3 months (mean difference, 1.0; 95% CI, -1.4 to 3.4; P = .96) and at 6 months (mean difference, 0.4; 95% CI, -2.3 to 3.5; P > .99). The needling procedure was not particularly painful, with a mean pain rating of 1.08 of 10. Participants perceived a 41% mean improvement in overall scar appearance on the treated side. No adverse events were reported.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: After 3 needling treatments, there was improvement in the appearance of acne scars over time compared with the control group, with minimal pain reported.

Though it is now accepted as the international standard of care, it represents a significant departure from methods of care for other infectious diseases, and debate continues regarding the effectiveness of its interventions. The debate has been largely uninformed by data; for example, little is known about the relationship between ancillary support services and primary care outcomes. We hypothesized that support services increase access to and retention in HIV primary care in an inner city public hospital clinic. We conducted a retrospective analysis of clinical data sets on 2,647 patients at the CORE Center, Chicago from 1997-1998 to investigate the relationship between four support services-case management (CM), transportation (TRANS), mental health (MH) and chemical dependency (CD)-and access to and retention in HIV primary care. We found that patients who received each of these services were significantly more likely to receive any care, regular care and had more visits than patients with no service, and retention increased by 15-18%. Female gender, younger age, self-pay status and IDU predicted less regular care. Need for all services was substantial and significantly greater in women. Outcomes improved to the greatest extent among patients who needed and received each service. We conclude that support services significantly increased access to and retention in HIV primary care. Our findings validate the multidisciplinary team model of HIV care, and suggest that health services that are tailored to the express needs of patients lead to better care and improved health outcomes.

The latest generation enhanced ASV device (PaceWave; ResMed) has a new feature--auto-adjustment of EPAP. This study tested the hypothesis that enhanced ASV with auto-adjustment of EPAP (PaceWave) is non-inferior to conventional ASV (AutoSetCS).
METHODS: This prospective, randomized, crossover, single-center study enrolled adult patients with stable heart failure (HF) and moderate-to-severe sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) who had been receiving conventional ASV therapy for at least 4 weeks. Patients received conventional ASV for one night and enhanced ASV on another night. Support settings for the two ASV devices were similar, with fixed expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) set to between 4 and 10 cm H2O and variable EPAP set to between 4 and 15 cm H2O. Full polysomnography was performed during ASV therapy on both nights. Endpoints were the number of nocturnal respiratory events and oxygen desaturations, and changes in blood pressure (BP).
RESULTS: Levels of EPAP were comparable during the use of enhanced and conventional ASV, but minimum and maximum inspiratory pressure support values were significantly higher with the PaceWave device. All measures of apnea and hypopnea, and oxygen saturation, were significantly improved during ASV therapy with either device. There were no significant changes in BP or heart rate.

Analyses Were Done Using Multiple Imputation Baseline to Week 12,34879448,Phase 3 Trials of Tapinarof Cream for Plaque Psoriasis.,"BACKGROUND: Tapinarof cream is a topical aryl hydrocarbon receptor-modulating agent under investigation for the treatment of psoriasis. Tapinarof modulates the expression of interleukin-17 and the skin-barrier proteins filaggrin and loricrin.
METHODS: We conducted two identical phase 3 randomized trials of tapinarof in patients with mild-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Adults with a baseline Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) score of 2 (mild) to 4 (severe) (on a scale from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating more severe psoriasis) and a percent of total body-surface area affected of 3 to 20% were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to use tapinarof 1% cream or vehicle cream once daily for 12 weeks. The primary end point, PGA response, was a PGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) and a decrease from baseline of at least 2 points at week 12. Secondary efficacy end points at week 12 were a reduction of at least 75% in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score, a PGA score of 0 or 1, the mean change from baseline in the percent of body-surface area affected, and a reduction of at least 90% in the PASI score. Patient-reported outcomes were the mean changes from baseline to week 12 in the proportion of patients who had a decrease of at least 4 points in the Peak Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (PP-NRS) score (range, 0 [no itch] to 10 [worst imaginable itch]), the PP-NRS total score, the Dermatology Life Quality Index total score, and the Psoriasis Symptom Diary score.
RESULTS: In trials 1 and 2, a total of 692 and 674 patients, respectively, were screened, with 510 and 515 patients being enrolled. A PGA response occurred in 35.4% of the patients in the tapinarof group and in 6.0% of those in the vehicle group in trial 1 and in 40.2% and 6.3%, respectively, in trial 2 (P<0.001 for both comparisons). Results for secondary end points and patient-reported outcomes were generally in the same direction as those for the primary end point. Adverse events with tapinarof cream included folliculitis, nasopharyngitis, contact dermatitis, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, and pruritus.
CONCLUSIONS: Tapinarof 1% cream once daily was superior to vehicle control in reducing the severity of plaque psoriasis over a period of 12 weeks but was associated with local adverse events and headache. Larger and longer trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tapinarof cream as compared with existing treatments for psoriasis.

METHODS: In this multicenter trial, we randomly assigned 131 patients who had one to three painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures to undergo either vertebroplasty or a simulated procedure without cement (control group). The primary outcomes were scores on the modified Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ) (on a scale of 0 to 23, with higher scores indicating greater disability) and patients' ratings of average pain intensity during the preceding 24 hours at 1 month (on a scale of 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more severe pain). Patients were allowed to cross over to the other study group after 1 month.
RESULTS: All patients underwent the assigned intervention (68 vertebroplasties and 63 simulated procedures). The baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. At 1 month, there was no significant difference between the vertebroplasty group and the control group in either the RDQ score (difference, 0.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], -1.3 to 2.8; P=0.49) or the pain rating (difference, 0.7; 95% CI, -0.3 to 1.7; P=0.19). Both groups had immediate improvement in disability and pain scores after the intervention. Although the two groups did not differ significantly on any secondary outcome measure at 1 month, there was a trend toward a higher rate of clinically meaningful improvement in pain (a 30% decrease from baseline) in the vertebroplasty group (64% vs. 48%, P=0.06). At 3 months, there was a higher crossover rate in the control group than in the vertebroplasty group (51% vs. 13%, P<0.001) [corrected]. There was one serious adverse event in each group.

The study aims are to determine whether adding behavioral training will increase the number of women who can discontinue drug therapy and sustain a significant reduction of incontinence; to test whether the short-term effectiveness of drug therapy can be enhanced by combining it with behavioral training; and to determine the cost-effectiveness of combined therapy.
DESIGN: Two-stage randomized clinical trial currently being conducted by the Urinary Incontinence Treatment Network, a clinical trials network established by the National Institutes of Health.
METHODS: Participants are 307 community-dwelling women with pure or predominant urge incontinence. Stage 1 consists of 10 weeks of drug therapy with sustained-release tolterodine alone or combined with behavioral training (pelvic floor muscle exercise training, bladder control techniques, fluid management). In stage 2, drug is withdrawn and behavioral training stopped. The primary outcome, measured at 8 months, is a composite of two endpoints (1) successful drug withdrawal (i.e. not requesting any other treatment for incontinence) and (2) achieving and maintaining > or =70% reduction in the frequency of incontinence episodes on bladder diary. The effects of treatment and drug withdrawal are measured at week 10 and months 4, 6, 8, 14, 20, and 26. Assessments include: the Medical Epidemiological and Social Aspects of Aging (MESA) incontinence questionnaire, pelvic floor muscle strength assessment, Incontinence Impact Questionnaire, Urogenital Distress Inventory, Overactive Bladder Questionnaire, Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12), costs associated with incontinence care, Health Utility Index Mark 3, Willingness to Pay Scale, and Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire.

The emergence and reemergence of RNA viruses continue to pose a significant public health threat worldwide with particular attention to the increasing incidence of flaviviruses, among others Dengue, West Nile Virus, and Yellow Fever viruses. Development of new and potent antivirals is thus urgently needed. Ivermectin, an already known antihelminthic drug, has shown potent effects in vitro on Flavivirus helicase, with EC50 values in the subnanomolar range for Yellow Fever and submicromolar EC50 for Dengue Fever, Japanese encephalitis, and tick-borne encephalitis viruses. However ivermectin is hampered in its application by pharmacokinetic problems (little solubility and high cytotoxicity). To overcome such problems we engineered different compositions of liposomes as ivermectin carriers characterizing and testing them on several cell lines for cytotoxicity. The engineered liposomes were less cytotoxic than ivermectin alone and they showed a significant increase of the antiviral activity in all the Dengue stains tested (1, 2, and S221). In the current study ivermectin is confirmed to be an effective potential antiviral and liposomes, as drug carriers, are shown to modulate the drug activity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Survey of 323 patients and 389 care partners at Geisinger Health System with linked information regarding access and use of patient portal functionality.
RESULTS: Few (0.4%) registered adult patient portal users shared access to their account. Patients varied in age (range: 18-102); more than half had a high school education or less (53.6%). Patient motivations for sharing access included: to help manage care (41.9%), for emergency reasons (29.7%), lack of technology experience (18.4%), or care partner request (10.0%).

The DASS Anxiety scale correlated 0.81 with the BAI, and the DASS Depression scale correlated 0.74 with the BDI. Factor analyses suggested that the BDI differs from the DASS Depression scale primarily in that the BDI includes items such as weight loss, insomnia, somatic preoccupation and irritability, which fail to discriminate between depression and other affective states.

However, data regarding the symptoms noted in DSM-IV and timing of their expression in the menstrual cycle have had little empirical support.
OBJECTIVE: To provide evidence informing the definitional criteria for PMDD.
DESIGN: Prospective surveys.
SETTING: General community and clinical settings.
PARTICIPANTS: Two cohorts that included a representative sample and a self-identified treatment-seeking cohort. Main Outcome Measure  Daily ratings of perimenstrual symptoms and functioning.
RESULTS: Mood and physical symptoms were most severe and were accompanied by impairment in the 4 days before through the first 2 days of menses for the self-identified group and in the 3 days before through the first 3 days of menses in the community sample. The most problematic symptoms endorsed were those listed in DSM-IV, but depressed mood was less frequent than other affective symptoms. In the combined sample, 4 or more symptoms was the optimal cutoff point for maximizing both sensitivity and specificity when predicting impairment.
CONCLUSIONS: This is informative for DSM-5 in that the most symptomatic period typically includes the few days before through the first 3 days of menses rather than only the premenstrual phase. Further, we validated the salience of PMDD symptoms included in DSM-IV. Although the number of symptoms most associated with distress and impairment differed between the 2 cohorts, results from the combined cohort suggest that 4 symptoms are linked with impairment from PMDD symptoms.",1,PRIMARY,Michelson SSRI Withdrawal Checklist,"Michelson SSRI Withdrawal Checklist - 16-item (not exactly 17-item, mood swings and crying were in DRSP) including dizziness, nausea, unusual dreams, chills, increased sweating, loose stools, agitation, ringing or noises in the ears.

Toward Your Goals is superior to Arm 2: Receiving Enhanced Usual Care in terms of Percent of Patients With Clinically Significant Weight Loss 3 months,25214540,Improving residents' clinical approach to obesity: impact of a multidisciplinary didactic curriculum.,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Obesity has been declared a 21st century pandemic by WHO. Yet surveys reveal physicians-in-training are uncomfortable managing obesity. One major barrier is the lack of residency education on obesity management. This study incorporates an obesity-specific didactic curriculum into an internal medicine (IM) residency programme and assesses its impact on residents' knowledge, attitudes, practice behaviours, and clinical outcomes in patients with obesity.
METHODS: The intervention consisted of four, 1 h, obesity-specific lectures in the University of Florida Resident Noon Conference. Lectures were taught by multidisciplinary experts and offered to 75 IM residents every 2 weeks from 5 November 2010 to 17 December 2010. Impact on IM residents' knowledge and attitudes was assessed by a pre- and post-intervention Obesity Awareness Questionnaire (OAQ). IM residents' clinical performance was assessed by chart reviews of 238 patients with body mass index >25 kg/m(2) in residents' clinics 4 months pre- and 6 months post-intervention for three clinical outcomes and seven practice behaviours on obesity management. Pre- and post-intervention outcomes were compared via paired t tests (quantitative data) or McNemar's test (binary data).
RESULTS: Mean lecture attendance was 25/75 residents (33%) per lecture. Survey response was 67/75 residents (89%) pre-OAQ and 63/75 residents (84%) post-OAQ. While most attitudes remained unchanged, IM residents gained significant confidence in exercise counselling, safety of bariatric surgery, and patients' weight loss potential; they were more likely to address obesity in the plan and referrals to bariatric surgery. Clinical outcomes and IM residents' knowledge demonstrated no improvement.
CONCLUSIONS: Our brief lecture-based curriculum has the potential to improve IM residents' attitudes and practice behaviours towards obesity. The lack of improvement in clinical outcomes and resident knowledge prompts the need for multimodal, longitudinal curricula with experiential application of obesity medicine.",2,PRIMARY,Percent of Patients With Clinically Significant Weight Loss,The percentage of patients who achieve 5-10% weight loss at 3- month study visit.,Arm 1: Receiving MOVE!

8982,NCT01472549,Chlorhexidine-alcohol is superior to Iodine-alcohol in terms of Number of Participants With Surgical Site Infection 30 days,26844840,A Randomized Trial Comparing Skin Antiseptic Agents at Cesarean Delivery.,"BACKGROUND: Preoperative skin antisepsis has the potential to decrease the risk of surgical-site infection. However, evidence is limited to guide the choice of antiseptic agent at cesarean delivery, which is the most common major surgical procedure among women in the United States.
METHODS: In this single-center, randomized, controlled trial, we evaluated whether the use of chlorhexidine-alcohol for preoperative skin antisepsis was superior to the use of iodine-alcohol for the prevention of surgical-site infection after cesarean delivery. We randomly assigned patients undergoing cesarean delivery to skin preparation with either chlorhexidine-alcohol or iodine-alcohol. The primary outcome was superficial or deep surgical-site infection within 30 days after cesarean delivery, on the basis of definitions from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
RESULTS: From September 2011 through June 2015, a total of 1147 patients were enrolled; 572 patients were assigned to chlorhexidine-alcohol and 575 to iodine-alcohol. In an intention-to-treat analysis, surgical-site infection was diagnosed in 23 patients (4.0%) in the chlorhexidine-alcohol group and in 42 (7.3%) in the iodine-alcohol group (relative risk, 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.34 to 0.90; P=0.02). The rate of superficial surgical-site infection was 3.0% in the chlorhexidine-alcohol group and 4.9% in the iodine-alcohol group (P=0.10); the rate of deep infection was 1.0% and 2.4%, respectively (P=0.07). The frequency of adverse skin reactions was similar in the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of chlorhexidine-alcohol for preoperative skin antisepsis resulted in a significantly lower risk of surgical-site infection after cesarean delivery than did the use of iodine-alcohol.

OBJECTIVE: To test out-of hospital emergency medical service (EMS) administration of GIK in the first hours of suspected acute coronary syndromes (ACS).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind effectiveness trial in 13 US cities (36 EMS agencies), from December 2006 through July 31, 2011, in which paramedics, aided by electrocardiograph (ECG)-based decision support, randomized 911 (871 enrolled) patients (mean age, 63.6 years; 71.0% men) with high probability of ACS.
INTERVENTION: Intravenous GIK solution (n = 411) or identical-appearing 5% glucose placebo (n = 460) administered by paramedics in the out-of-hospital setting and continued for 12 hours.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The prespecified primary end point was progression of ACS to myocardial infarction (MI) within 24 hours, as assessed by biomarkers and ECG evidence. Prespecified secondary end points included survival at 30 days and a composite of prehospital or in-hospital cardiac arrest or in-hospital mortality, analyzed by intent-to-treat and by presentation with ST-segment elevation.

CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with suspected ACS, out-of-hospital administration of intravenous GIK, compared with glucose placebo, did not reduce progression to MI. Compared with placebo, GIK administration was not associated with improvement in 30-day survival but was associated with lower rates of the composite outcome of cardiac arrest or in-hospital mortality.

In the present second pilot study, we enrolled 30 patients with clinically stable ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction randomized to anakinra, recombinant interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, 100 mg/day for 14 days or placebo in a double-blind fashion. The primary end point was the difference in the interval change in left ventricular (LV) end-systolic volume index between the 2 groups within 10 to 14 weeks. The secondary end points included changes in the LV end-diastolic volume index, LV ejection fraction, and C-reactive protein levels. No significant changes in end-systolic volume index, LV end-diastolic volume index, or LV ejection fraction were seen in the placebo group. Compared to placebo, treatment with anakinra led to no measurable differences in these parameters. Anakinra significantly blunted the increase in C-reactive protein between admission and 72 hours (+0.8 mg/dl, interquartile range -6.4 to +4.2, vs +21.1 mg/dl, interquartile range +8.7 to +36.6, p = 0.002), which correlated with the changes in LV end-diastolic volume index and LV end-systolic volume index at 10 to 14 weeks (R = +0.83, p = 0.002, and R = +0.55, p = 0.077, respectively).

METHODS: We randomly assigned 210 patients with oral glucocorticoid-treated asthma to receive add-on dupilumab (at a dose of 300 mg) or placebo every 2 weeks for 24 weeks. After a glucocorticoid dose-adjustment period before randomization, glucocorticoid doses were adjusted in a downward trend from week 4 to week 20 and then maintained at a stable dose for 4 weeks. The primary end point was the percentage reduction in the glucocorticoid dose at week 24.

The reasons for this late start are myriad, multifactorial, and complex. This infrastructure should continue to be formed, intersectoral approaches are essential to advance, and advocacy remains a key pillar.

As described previously in a randomised phase 2 study (n=250), 58 weeks of romiplostim treatment in patients with International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS)-defined lower-risk (low-risk or intermediate-1 risk) myelodysplastic syndromes led to reduced platelet transfusions (p<0·0001) and increased International Working Group-defined haematological improvement-platelet rates (p<0·0001) versus placebo. However, the study drug was discontinued because of the potential risk for progression to or incorrect diagnosis or treatment for acute myeloid leukaemia, based on an acute myeloid leukaemia interim hazard ratio (HR) of 2·5; the subsequent 58-week acute myeloid leukaemia HR was 1·2 (95% CI 0·4-3·8).
METHODS: This study is a 5-year follow-up of a phase 2, multicentre, double-blind trial of romiplostim treatment in patients with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes. Eligible patients were recruited at 109 centres in North America, Europe, Russia, and Australia, were aged 18-90 years, and had platelets of 20 × 10
FINDINGS: Patients were recruited from July 21, 2008, to Dec 16, 2010. 167 patients were assigned to receive romiplostim treatment and 83 were assigned to receive placebo. 210 (84%) of 250 patients entered the 5-year long-term follow-up (139 patients in the romiplostim group and 83 in the placebo group). At the end of follow-up, proportions of patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (20 [12%] of 167 in the romiplostim group vs nine [11%] of 83 in the placebo group; HR 1·06 [95% CI 0·48-2·33]; p=0·88) and proportions who died (93 [56%] vs 54 [54%]; HR 1·03 [0·72-1·47]; p=0·89) were not significantly different between the two groups.
INTERPRETATION: Following the decision to stop the study drug, 5-year long-term follow-up HRs for transformation to acute myeloid leukaemia and HRs for death did not differ between patients treated with romiplostim and those treated with placebo, indicating that use of romiplostim is probably not associated with any increased risk of acute myeloid leukaemia or death, despite initial concerns.

OBJECTIVES: To test the feasibility of a novel telemetric system for home CPAP titration.
METHODS: One-night home CPAP titration was carried out on 20 SAHS patients (56±3 years; BMI=35±2 kg/m²). A telemetric unit, based on the conventional GPRS mobile phone network and connected to a commercial CPAP device, allowed the hospital technician to monitor flow, pressure and air leaks by remote control and titrate CPAP (elimination of apneas, hypopneas, flow limitation and snoring) in real time. After 1 week, a full hospital polysomnography was performed while the patient was subjected to the value of CPAP that was previously titrated at home via telemetry.
RESULTS: The home-titrated CPAP systematically improved patients' breathing: the apnea-hypopnea index and percentage of sleep time with arterial oxygen saturation below 90% were reduced from 58.1±5.1 to 3.8±0.6 events/h and from 19.8±1.1% to 4.4±0.7%, respectively. This CPAP value (9.15±0.47 cmH₂O) was virtually the same as the pressure that optimized breathing during hospital polysomnography (9.20±0.41 cmH₂O; mean difference: 0.02 cmH₂O, limits of agreement:±1.00 cmH₂O).

Abstinence reinforcement is among the most effective means of initiating cocaine abstinence. Practical and effective means of maintaining abstinence reinforcement programs over time are needed.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether employment-based abstinence reinforcement can be an effective long-term maintenance intervention for cocaine dependence.
DESIGN: Participants (n = 128) were enrolled in a 6-month job skills training and abstinence initiation program. Participants who initiated abstinence, attended regularly and developed needed job skills during the first 6 months were hired as operators in a data entry business and assigned randomly to an employment-only (control, n = 24) or abstinence-contingent employment (n = 27) group.
SETTING: A non-profit data entry business. Participants Unemployed welfare recipients who used cocaine persistently while enrolled in methadone treatment in Baltimore.
INTERVENTION: Abstinence-contingent employment participants received 1 year of employment-based contingency management, in which access to employment was contingent upon provision of drug-free urine samples under routine and then random drug testing. If a participant provided drug-positive urine or failed to provide a mandatory sample, then that participant received a temporary reduction in pay and could not work until urinalysis confirmed recent abstinence.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Cocaine-negative urine samples at monthly assessments across 1 year of employment.
RESULTS: During the 1 year of employment, abstinence-contingent employment participants provided significantly more cocaine-negative urine samples than employment-only participants [79.3% and 50.7%, respectively; P = 0.004, odds ratio (OR) = 3.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.60-8.69].

We performed a randomized placebo-controlled trial of omega-3-acid (O3A) ethyl esters in HIV-infected patients with hypertriglyceridaemia, hypothesizing that O3A would decrease serum levels of triglycerides, markers of systemic inflammation, and markers of bone turnover.
METHODS: HIV-infected patients (n = 48 recruited at three sites) with CD4 count >200 cells/μL, suppressed viral load, and triglycerides >200 mg/dL were randomized to placebo or 3.6 g/d of O3A. Fasting lipid profiles and markers of inflammation and bone turnover were assessed at baseline and after 8 weeks of treatment.
RESULTS: Baseline HIV status, lipid profile, bone metabolism and cardiovascular risk factors were similar between the groups. Inflammatory markers were similar between the treatment groups at baseline, except for interleukin (IL)-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, which were higher in the O3A group. The concentration of triglycerides in patients receiving O3A decreased by a median (interquartile range (IQR)) of -34 (-149, 9.5) mg/dL vs. a median increase of 46.5 (-51, 123) mg/dL in the placebo group (P = 0.01).

However, data regarding the symptoms noted in DSM-IV and timing of their expression in the menstrual cycle have had little empirical support.
OBJECTIVE: To provide evidence informing the definitional criteria for PMDD.
DESIGN: Prospective surveys.
SETTING: General community and clinical settings.
PARTICIPANTS: Two cohorts that included a representative sample and a self-identified treatment-seeking cohort. Main Outcome Measure  Daily ratings of perimenstrual symptoms and functioning.
RESULTS: Mood and physical symptoms were most severe and were accompanied by impairment in the 4 days before through the first 2 days of menses for the self-identified group and in the 3 days before through the first 3 days of menses in the community sample. The most problematic symptoms endorsed were those listed in DSM-IV, but depressed mood was less frequent than other affective symptoms. In the combined sample, 4 or more symptoms was the optimal cutoff point for maximizing both sensitivity and specificity when predicting impairment.
CONCLUSIONS: This is informative for DSM-5 in that the most symptomatic period typically includes the few days before through the first 3 days of menses rather than only the premenstrual phase. Further, we validated the salience of PMDD symptoms included in DSM-IV. Although the number of symptoms most associated with distress and impairment differed between the 2 cohorts, results from the combined cohort suggest that 4 symptoms are linked with impairment from PMDD symptoms.",1,PRIMARY,Inventory of Depression Symptoms (IDS-C),"Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Clinician version (IDS-C) - a depression measure that has 28 items and detects appropriate variations between follicular and luteal phases in subjects with PMDD.

New treatment modalities, allowing for reduction of alcohol consumption as a treatment goal are needed. This study evaluated the efficacy of as-needed use of the opioid system modulator nalmefene in reducing alcohol consumption in patients with alcohol dependence.
METHODS: Six hundred and four patients (placebo = 298; nalmefene = 306),≥18 years of age, with a diagnosis of alcohol dependence,≥6 heavy drinking days, and average alcohol consumption≥World Health Organization medium drinking risk level in the 4 weeks preceding screening, were randomized (1:1) to 24 weeks of as-needed placebo or nalmefene 18 mg.
RESULTS: Patients taking placebo (n = 289) and patients taking nalmefene (n = 290) were included in the efficacy analyses. At Month 6, there was a significant effect of nalmefene compared with placebo in reducing the number of heavy drinking days (-2.3 days [95% confidence interval:-3.8 to-.8]; p = .0021) and total alcohol consumption (-11.0 g/day [95% confidence interval:-16.8 to-5.1]; p = .0003). Improvements in Clinical Global Impression and liver enzymes were larger in the nalmefene group compared with placebo at Week 24. Adverse events (most mild or moderate) and dropouts due to adverse events were more common with nalmefene than placebo. The number of patients with serious adverse events was similar in the two groups.

(up to 30 minutes),25596790,Real-time ultrasound guidance facilitates transradial access: RAUST (Radial Artery access with Ultrasound Trial).,"OBJECTIVES: This study sought to assess the utility of ultrasound (US) guidance for transradial arterial access.
BACKGROUND: US guidance has been demonstrated to facilitate vascular access, but has not been tested in a multicenter randomized fashion for transradial cardiac catheterization.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial of 698 patients undergoing transradial cardiac catheterization. Patients were randomized to needle insertion with either palpation or real-time US guidance (351 palpation, 347 US). Primary endpoints were the number of forward attempts required for access, first-pass success rate, and time to access.
RESULTS: The number of attempts was reduced with US guidance [mean: 1.65 ± 1.2 vs. 3.05 ± 3.4, p < 0.0001; median: 1 (interquartile range [IQR]: 1 to 2) vs. 2 (1 to 3), p < 0.0001] and the first-pass success rate improved (64.8% vs. 43.9%, p < 0.0001). The time to access was reduced (88 ± 78 s vs. 108 ± 112 s, p = 0.006; median: 64 [IQR: 45 to 94] s vs. 74 [IQR: 49 to 120] s, p = 0.01). Ten patients in the control group required crossover to US guidance after 5 min of failed palpation attempts with 8 of 10 (80%) having successful sheath insertion with US. The number of difficult access procedures was decreased with US guidance (2.4% vs. 18.6% for ≥5 attempts, p < 0.001; 3.7% vs. 6.8% for ≥5min, p = 0.07).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants were randomized to once-daily LixiLan (n = 161) or Gla-100 (n = 162) for 24 weeks, while continuing metformin. LixiLan and Gla-100 were started at 10 units/5 μg and 10 units, respectively, and titrated based on the Gla-100 requirement according to fasting plasma glucose levels. The primary objective was to test noninferiority (upper bound of the 95% CI ≤0.4%) of LixiLan in reducing HbA1c; if met, statistical superiority was tested. Secondary objectives included body weight changes, hypoglycemia, and safety.
RESULTS: Baseline characteristics (mean age 57 years, diabetes duration 6-7 years, BMI 32 kg/m(2)) were similar between groups. At week 24, mean HbA1c was reduced from 8.0% (64 mmol/mol) at baseline to 6.3% (45 mmol/mol) and 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) with LixiLan and Gla-100, respectively, establishing statistical noninferiority and superiority of LixiLan (least-squared mean [95% CI] difference: -0.17% [-0.31, -0.04] {-1.9 mmol/mol [-3.4, -0.4]}; P = 0.01). HbA1c <7.0% (<53 mmol/mol) was achieved in 84% and 78% of participants (nonsignificant), respectively. LixiLan improved 2-h postmeal plasma glucose versus Gla-100 (least-squared mean difference: -3.17 mmol/L [-57 mg/dL]; P < 0.0001).

Over 5 million arthroscopies are performed worldwide yearly. It was our study objective to assess the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban for thromboprophylaxis after therapeutic KA. Patients undergoing KA in nine Italian teaching or community hospitals were allocated to once-daily rivaroxaban (10 mg) or placebo for seven days in a phase II, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial. The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of all-cause death, symptomatic thromboembolism and asymptomatic proximal DVT at three months; major bleeding represented the primary safety outcome. All patients underwent whole-leg ultrasonography at day 7(+1), or earlier if symptomatic. A total of 241 patients were randomised (122 rivaroxaban, 119 placebo), and 234 completed the study. The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 1/120 of the rivaroxaban group and in 7/114 of the placebo group (0.8 % vs 6.1 %, respectively, p=0.03; absolute risk difference, -5.3 %, 95 % CI, -11.4 to -0.8; crude relative risk 0.14, 95 % CI, 0.02 to 0.83; number-needed-to-treat=19).

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to develop and pilot test a simple telephone-based mindfulness training intervention to address this population's unique needs.
METHODS: Open trial involving survivors of medical and surgical critical illness and their informal caregivers, using a pretest-posttest design.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We developed a six-session, telephone-delivered, ICU survivor-specific mindfulness intervention based on past focus groups, the medical literature, and the precedent of the most effective components of existing mindfulness programs. A total of 11 survivors of mechanical ventilation were enrolled, together with 2 informal caregivers for exploratory purposes. Three patients dropped out before intervention initiation because of progressive illness or severe social stressors. Of the 10 remaining participants, 8 (80%) completed the program within 7 weeks. Among these eight patients and caregivers who completed all study procedures, six (75%) experienced improvement in symptoms of psychological distress (anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder). Changes in distress symptoms were correlated with improvement in mindfulness qualities, adaptive coping, and emotion regulation. Participants reported high satisfaction with the program in postintervention interviews.
CONCLUSIONS: A new ICU survivor-specific mindfulness training intervention delivered by telephone was acceptable and feasible.

METHOD: Seventy-one women and 13 men (N = 84) with partially remitted major depression after treatment were randomly assigned to either 10 weeks of Internet-based CBT or to a control group. Self-help material was used in combination with e-mail contact with a personal therapist. Monthly self-ratings of depressive symptoms were made, and diagnostic interviews were conducted before and after the treatment period, as well as 6 months later.
RESULTS: Significantly fewer participants in the CBT group experienced relapse (4/38 or 10.5%) compared with those in the control group (14/37 or 37.8%). The difference in relapse rates between groups occurred early in the study period and was still apparent after 6 months. A trend towards a larger reduction in depressive symptoms was observed at post-treatment in the participants who received CBT compared with controls.

Huntington Study Group.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the rate of functional decline in a large cohort of patients with Huntington's disease (HD) followed at 43 sites by the Huntington Study Group (HSG).
METHODS: The annual rate of functional decline was measured using the Total Functional Capacity Scale (TFC) and the Independence Scale (IS) in 960 patients with definite HD followed prospectively for a mean of 18.3 months. All patients were rated with the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS). Sample size calculations for hypothetical clinical trials were calculated.
RESULTS: A factor analysis of the UHDRS at baseline yielded 15 factors accounting for 77% of the variance. The TFC score declined at a rate of 0.72 units/year (standard error [SE] 0.04) and the IS score declined at a rate of 4.52 units/year (SE 0.23). Lower TFC score at baseline, indicating more severe impairment, was associated with less rapid annual decline in TFC score, perhaps reflecting the floor effect of the scale. The annual rate of decline for 575 patients with baseline TFC scores of 7 to 13 was 0.97 (SE 0.06), was 0.38 (SE 0.08) for 270 patients with baseline TFC scores of 3 to 6, and was 0.06 (SE 0.1) for 101 patients with TFC scores of 0 to 2. In multivariate analysis (n = 960), longer disease duration and better cognitive status at baseline were associated with a less rapid rate of decline in TFC score, whereas depressive symptomatology was the only factor associated with more rapid decline on the IS score. Age at onset of HD, sex, weight, and education did not affect decline on either score.
CONCLUSIONS: The comparable rates of decline on the TFC and the IS scores with other published studies suggest that these estimates of functional decline are representative of HD patients who are evaluated at HSG research sites. In longitudinal analysis, longer disease duration and better neuropsychological performance at baseline were associated with a less rapid rate of decline in TFC score, whereas depressive symptomatology at baseline was associated with a more rapid decline in the IS score.

AIMS: We hypothesized that memantine, a low-potency, uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist, would be safe and effective when used as an adjunct to oral naltrexone in the treatment of opioid dependence, particularly in preventing relapse to opiate use in detoxified individuals.
METHODS: Opioid-dependent participants (N=112) were enrolled. Following detoxification all participants were inducted onto oral naltrexone and were randomized to receive memantine 15 mg bid (N=27), memantine 30 mg bid (N=27) or placebo (N=27) for 12-weeks in combination with naltrexone 50mg/day and individual relapse-prevention therapy. The primary outcome was the retention in treatment since treatment dropout is most commonly associated with relapse to opiate use.
RESULTS: Twenty-six percent of participants withdrew from treatment prior to starting naltrexone. Of those that were randomized 35% completed 4 weeks only, and 24% completed all 12 weeks of treatment. There was no significant difference in treatment retention or heroin use, opiate withdrawal symptoms and craving between the groups treated with memantine vs. placebo.

Continuous positive airway pressure applied through nasal prongs is an effective, less-invasive method to improve gas exchange and reduce apnea in these infants. A large number of studies have evaluated the possibility of reducing the need or duration of mechanical ventilation by early use of nasal continuous positive airway pressure shortly after birth and by applying it after extubation. Although results of these trials have not been consistent, most of the evidence suggests that nasal continuous positive airway pressure is a viable alternative to mechanical ventilation in many preterm infants and that its use after extubation contributes to maintain better lung function and reduces apnea.

METHODS: We randomly assigned 2499 HIV-seronegative men or transgender women who have sex with men to receive a combination of two oral antiretroviral drugs, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC-TDF), or placebo once daily. All subjects received HIV testing, risk-reduction counseling, condoms, and management of sexually transmitted infections.
RESULTS: The study subjects were followed for 3324 person-years (median, 1.2 years; maximum, 2.8 years). Of these subjects, 10 were found to have been infected with HIV at enrollment, and 100 became infected during follow-up (36 in the FTC-TDF group and 64 in the placebo group), indicating a 44% reduction in the incidence of HIV (95% confidence interval, 15 to 63; P=0.005).

Guidelines recommend the use of PCC in the setting of life-threatening bleeds, but little is known on the most effective dosing strategies and how the presenting international normalized ratio affects response to therapy.
OBJECTIVES: This review aims to highlight available data on monitoring techniques, address shortcomings of currently available data, the reversal of life-threatening and critical bleeds with PCC, and how this product compares to other therapeutic options used in critically ill patients.
DISCUSSION: PCC has been identified as a potential therapy for critically bleeding patients, but patient-specific factors, product availability, and current data should weigh the decision to use it. Most data exist regarding patients experiencing vitamin K antagonist-induced bleeding, more specifically, those with intracranial hemorrhage. PCC has also been studied in trauma-induced hemorrhage; however, it remains controversial, as its potential benefits have the abilities to become flaws in this setting.
CONCLUSION: Health care professionals must remain aware of the differences in products and interpret how three- versus four-factor products may affect patients, and interpret literature accordingly. The clinician must be cognizant of how to progress when treating a bleeding patient, propose a supported dosing scheme, and address the need for appropriate factor VII supplementation. At this point, PCC cannot be recommended for first-line therapy in patients with traumatic hemorrhage, and should be reserved for refractory bleeding until more data are available.",2,PRIMARY,Cryoprecipitate (Cryo) Blood Product Transfusion,"The number of subject's who received 0,1,2,3 or more units of Cryo's transfused from completion of study drug administration though midnight of the next day.",Prothrombin Complex Concentrate,Fresh Frozen Plasma,"After cardiopulmonary bypass, patients received protamine at dose 0.01 mg/unit of heparin given with target activated clotting time (ACT) within 10% of baseline value.

We also set out to identify characteristics of responders. We treated 52 subjects with new-onset T1D with teplizumab for 2 weeks at diagnosis and after 1 year in an open-label, randomized, controlled trial. In the intent to treat analysis of the primary end point, patients treated with teplizumab had a reduced decline in C-peptide at 2 years (mean -0.28 nmol/L [95% CI -0.36 to -0.20]) versus control (mean -0.46 nmol/L [95% CI -0.57 to -0.35]; P = 0.002), a 75% improvement. The most common adverse events were rash, transient upper respiratory infections, headache, and nausea. In a post hoc analysis we characterized clinical responders and found that metabolic (HbA1c and insulin use) and immunologic features distinguished this group from those who did not respond to teplizumab. We conclude that teplizumab treatment preserves insulin production and reduces the use of exogenous insulin in some patients with new-onset T1D.

METHODS: This was a randomized, parallel-group, multinational, non-inferiority clinical trial with an active-controlled, double-blind treatment period in which patients ≥ 65 and ≤ 85 years of age with T2DM were screened at 85 sites. Patients were randomized to once-daily sitagliptin (100 or 50 mg, depending on renal function) or glimepiride (in titrated doses) for 30 weeks. The main outcome measures were change from baseline in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and body weight; and the incidence of symptomatic hypoglycemia.
RESULTS: The mean baseline HbA1c was 7.8% in both the sitagliptin group (n = 197) and the glimepiride group (n = 191). After 30 weeks, the least squares (LS) mean change in HbA1c baseline was -0.32% with sitagliptin and -0.51 % with glimepiride, for a between-group difference (95% CI) of 0.19% (0.03-0.34). This result met the pre-specified criterion for declaring non-inferiority, which required that the upper 95% confidence limit lie below 0.4%. The LS mean change in FPG from baseline was -14.5 mg/dL with sitagliptin and -21.2 mg/dL with glimepiride, for a between-group difference (95% CI) of 6.7 mg/dL (0.7-12.7). The percentages of patients with adverse events of symptomatic hypoglycemia were 0.8% in the sitagliptin group and 4.7% in the glimepiride group (between-treatment difference = -3.9%, p = 0.009). The LS mean change in body weight from baseline was 0.4 kg with sitagliptin and 1.1 kg with glimepiride, for a between-group difference of -0.7 kg (p = 0.011).
CONCLUSION: In elderly patients with T2DM and inadequate glycemic control with diet and exercise alone, sitagliptin provided non-inferior glycemic control after 30 weeks of treatment compared with glimepiride. Compared with glimepiride, sitagliptin had a lower risk of hypoglycemia. Sitagliptin was weight-neutral; while the between-group difference in change from baseline in body weight was statistically significant, the modest difference may not be clinically meaningful.

Antiandrogen therapies reduce expression of TMPRSS2.
OBJECTIVE: To determine if temporary androgen suppression induced by degarelix improves clinical outcomes of inpatients hospitalized with COVID-19.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Hormonal Intervention for the Treatment in Veterans With COVID-19 Requiring Hospitalization (HITCH) phase 2, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial compared efficacy of degarelix plus standard care vs placebo plus standard care on clinical outcomes in men hospitalized with COVID-19 but not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. Inpatients were enrolled at 14 Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals from July 22, 2020, to April 8, 2021. Data were analyzed from August 9 to October 15, 2021.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients stratified by age, history of hypertension, and disease severity were centrally randomized 2:1 to degarelix, (1-time subcutaneous dose of 240 mg) or a saline placebo. Standard care included but was not limited to supplemental oxygen, antibiotics, vasopressor support, peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis, intravenous fluids, remdesivir, convalescent plasma, and dexamethasone.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The composite primary end point was mortality, ongoing need for hospitalization, or requirement for mechanical ventilation at day 15 after randomization. Secondary end points were time to clinical improvement, inpatient mortality, length of hospitalization, duration of mechanical ventilation, time to achieve a temperature within reference range, maximum severity of COVID-19, and the composite end point at 30 days.
RESULTS: The trial was stopped for futility after the planned interim analysis, at which time there were 96 evaluable patients, including 62 patients randomized to the degarelix group and 34 patients in the placebo group, out of 198 initially planned. The median (range) age was 70.5 (48-85) years. Common comorbidities included chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (15 patients [15.6%]), hypertension (75 patients [78.1%]), cardiovascular disease (27 patients [28.1%]), asthma (12 patients [12.5%]), diabetes (49 patients [51.0%]), and chronic respiratory failure requiring supplemental oxygen at baseline prior to COVID-19 (9 patients [9.4%]). For the primary end point, there was no significant difference between the degarelix and placebo groups (19 patients [30.6%] vs 9 patients [26.5%]; P = .67). Similarly, no differences were observed between degarelix and placebo groups in any secondary end points, including inpatient mortality (11 patients [17.7%] vs 6 patients [17.6%]) or all-cause mortality (11 patients [17.7%] vs 7 patents [20.6%]). There were no differences between degarelix and placebo groups in the overall rates of adverse events (13 patients [21.0%] vs 8 patients [23.5%) and serious adverse events (19 patients [30.6%] vs 13 patients [32.4%]), nor unexpected safety concerns.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial of androgen suppression vs placebo and usual care for men hospitalized with COVID-19, degarelix did not result in amelioration of COVID-19 severity.

DESIGN: Randomized controlled pilot study.
SETTING: Academic geriatrics ambulatory clinic.
PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-two individuals aged 65 and older and their unpaid companions.
INTERVENTION: A self-administered checklist was compared with usual care. The checklist was designed to elicit and align patient and companion perspectives regarding health concerns to discuss with the doctor and stimulate discussion about the companion's role in the visit.
PRIMARY OUTCOME: ratio of patient-centered communication, coded from visit audiotapes.
SECONDARY OUTCOMES: checklist acceptability; visit duration; patient-companion verbal activity; patient- and physician-reported perspectives of the visit.
RESULTS: All intervention patients and companions (n = 17) completed the checklist, and all participants (n = 32 dyads) completed the study. Patients and companions stated that the checklist was easy to complete (88%) and useful (91%), and they uniformly (100%) recommended it to other patients. Communication was significantly more patient-centered in intervention group visits (ratio of 1.22 vs 0.71; P = .03). Visit duration (35.0 and 30.6 minutes; P = .34) and percentage of total verbal activity contributed by patients and companions (58.2% and 56.3% of visit statements; P = .50) were comparable in the intervention and control groups, respectively. Physicians were more likely to indicate that intervention companions ""helped them provide good care to the patient"" (94% vs 60%; P = .02). Intervention patients were more likely to indicate that they ""better understood their doctor's advice and explanations"" because their companion was present (82% vs 47%; P = .03).

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether combining programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) inhibition improved patient survival in metastatic refractory CRC.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized phase 2 study was conducted in 27 cancer centers across Canada between August 2016 and June 2017, and data were analyzed on October 18, 2018. Eligible patients had histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum; received all available standard systemic therapies (fluoropyrimidines, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and bevacizumab if appropriate; cetuximab or panitumumab if RAS wild-type tumors; regorafenib if available); were aged 18 years or older; had adequate organ function; had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and measurable disease.
INTERVENTIONS: We randomly assigned patients to receive either 75 mg of tremelimumab every 28 days for the first 4 cycles plus 1500 mg durvalumab every 28 days, or best supportive care alone (BSC) in a 2:1 ratio.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was overall survival (OS) and a 2-sided P<.10 was considered statistically significant. Circulating cell-free DNA from baseline plasma was used to determine microsatellite instability (MSI) and tumor mutation burden (TMB).
RESULTS: Of 180 patients enrolled (121 men [67.2%] and 59 women [32.8%]; median [range] age, 65 [36-87] years), 179 were treated. With a median follow-up of 15.2 months, the median OS was 6.6 months for durvalumab and tremelimumab and 4.1 months for BSC (hazard ratio [HR], 0.72; 90% CI, 0.54-0.97; P = .07). Progression-free survival was 1.8 months and 1.9 months respectively (HR, 1.01; 90% CI, 0.76-1.34). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were significantly more frequent with immunotherapy (75 [64%] patients in the treatment group had at least 1 grade 3 or higher adverse event vs 12 [20%] in the BSC group). Circulating cell-free DNA analysis was successful in 168 of 169 patients with available samples. In patients who were microsatellite stable (MSS), OS was significantly improved with durvalumab and tremelimumab (HR, 0.66; 90% CI, 0.49-0.89; P = .02). Patients who were MSS with plasma TMB of 28 variants per megabase or more (21% of MSS patients) had the greatest OS benefit (HR, 0.34; 90% CI, 0.18-0.63; P = .004).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This phase 2 study suggests that combined immune checkpoint inhibition with durvalumab plus tremelimumab may be associated with prolonged OS in patients with advanced refractory CRC. Elevated plasma TMB may select patients most likely to benefit from durvalumab and tremelimumab. Further confirmation studies are warranted.

This limits the ability of medical and public health professionals to develop and evaluate coordinated screening programs that apply resources and population management strategies available for one cancer site to other sites. We present a trans-organ conceptual model that incorporates a single screening episode for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers into a unified framework based on clinical guidelines and protocols; the model concepts could be expanded to other organ sites. The model covers four types of care in the screening process: risk assessment, detection, diagnosis, and treatment. Interfaces between different provider teams (eg, primary care and specialty care), including communication and transfer of responsibility, may occur when transitioning between types of care. Our model highlights across each organ site similarities and differences in steps, interfaces, and transitions in the screening process and documents the conclusion of a screening episode. This model was developed within the National Cancer Institute-funded consortium Population-based Research Optimizing Screening through Personalized Regimens (PROSPR). PROSPR aims to optimize the screening process for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer and includes seven research centers and a statistical coordinating center.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the effect of intensive glycemic control strategies on the outcomes of death, stroke, myocardial infarction, incidence of infection, and hypoglycemia. We included randomized and observational studies. Bibliographic databases were searched through February 2010. Random effects model was used to pool results across studies.
RESULTS: Nineteen studies (nine randomized and 10 observational studies) were included. The risk of bias across studies was moderate. Meta-analysis demonstrates that intensive glycemic control was not associated with significant effect on the risk of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. There was a trend for increased risk of hypoglycemia (relative risk, 1.58; 95% confidence interval, 0.97-2.57), particularly in surgical studies and when the planned glycemic target was achieved. Intensive glycemic control was associated with decreased risk of infection (relative risk, 0.41; 95% confidence interval, 0.21-0.77) that was mainly derived from studies in surgical settings.

In the present study, we examined the curative effects of aromatherapy in dementia in 28 elderly people, 17 of whom had Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: After a control period of 28 days, aromatherapy was performed over the following 28 days, with a wash out period of another 28 days. Aromatherapy consisted of the use of rosemary and lemon essential oils in the morning, and lavender and orange in the evening. To determine the effects of aromatherapy, patients were evaluated using the Japanese version of the Gottfries, Brane, Steen scale (GBSS-J), Functional Assessment Staging of Alzheimer's disease (FAST), a revised version of Hasegawa's Dementia Scale (HDS-R), and the Touch Panel-type Dementia Assessment Scale (TDAS) four times: before the control period, after the control period, after aromatherapy, and after the washout period.
RESULTS: All patients showed significant improvement in personal orientation related to cognitive function on both the GBSS-J and TDAS after therapy. In particular, patients with AD showed significant improvement in total TDAS scores. Result of routine laboratory tests showed no significant changes, suggesting that there were no side-effects associated with the use of aromatherapy.

We evaluated the relationship between prenatal vitamin C and E (C/E) supplementation and perinatal outcomes by maternal self-reported smoking status focusing on outcomes known to be impacted by maternal smoking.
DESIGN/SETTING/POPULATION: A secondary analysis of a multi-centre trial of vitamin C/E supplementation starting at 9-16 weeks in low-risk nulliparous women with singleton gestations.
METHODS: We examined the effect of vitamin C/E by smoking status at randomisation using the Breslow-Day test for interaction.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The trial's primary outcomes were PE and a composite outcome of pregnancy-associated hypertension (PAH) with serious adverse outcomes. Perinatal outcomes included preterm birth and abruption.
RESULTS: There were no differences in baseline characteristics within subgroups (smokers versus nonsmokers) by vitamin supplementation status. The effect of prenatal vitamin C/E on the risk of PE (P = 0.66) or PAH composite outcome (P = 0.86) did not differ by smoking status. Vitamin C/E was protective for placental abruption in smokers (relative risk [RR] 0.09; 95% CI 0.00-0.87], but not in nonsmokers (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.52-1.62) (P = 0.01), and for preterm birth in smokers (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.58-0.99) but not in nonsmokers (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.90-1.17) (P = 0.046).

METHODS: The authors conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 1:1 allocation, two-arm parallel group, superiority design, randomized controlled trial in patients undergoing microsurgical abdominally based breast reconstruction. Intraoperatively, epidural catheters were inserted under direct vision through the triangle of Petit on both sides of the abdomen into the transversus abdominis plane just before rectus fascial closure. Patients received either bupivacaine (study group) or saline (placebo group) through the catheters for 2 postoperative days. All patients received hydromorphone by means of a patient-controlled analgesic pump. The primary outcome was the difference in the parenteral opioid consumption on each postoperative day between the groups. The secondary outcome measures included the following: total in-hospital opioid; antinausea medication; pain, nausea, and sedation scores; Quality of Recovery Score; time to ambulation; and hospital stay duration.
RESULTS: Between September of 2011 and June of 2013, 93 patients were enrolled: 49 received bupivacaine and 44 received saline. There were 11 postoperative complications (13 percent); none were related to the catheter. Primary outcomes were completed by 85 of 93 patients (91.3 percent); the mean parenteral morphine consumption was significantly reduced on postoperative day 1 in the bupivacaine group (20.7±20.1 mg) compared with 30.0±19.1 mg in the control group (p=0.02). There were no significant differences in secondary outcomes.

Very little is also known about the co-occurrences between substance use disorders and mood and anxiety disorders among these two minority groups and how their rates compare to Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics.
METHOD: Analyses were based on a large (n = 43093) nationally representative survey of the adult (18+ years), U.S. population supplemented by a group quarters sampling frame. Prevalences and associations of major DSM-IV mood, anxiety and substance use disorders were examined among all major race/ethnic subgroups of the population.
RESULTS: Twelve-month rates of most mood, anxiety and substance use disorders were generally greatest among Native Americans and lowest among Asians. For most race/ethnic subgroups, alcohol and drug dependence, but not abuse, were significantly associated with mood disorders. With few exceptions, there were no significant associations between alcohol and drug abuse and anxiety disorders. In contrast, alcohol dependence was associated with most anxiety disorders among Whites, Blacks and Asians, but not among Native Americans.
CONCLUSIONS: The 12-month prevalence of substance use, mood, and anxiety disorders varied greatly across the five major race/ethnic subgroups of the population.

Even though coffee intake has been associated with some health benefits in epidemiological studies, the bioavailability of coffee phenolics is not fully understood.
OBJECTIVE AND STUDY DESIGN: We performed a dose-response study measuring plasma bioavailability of phenolics after drinking three increasing, but still nutritionally relevant doses of instant pure soluble coffee. The study design was a one treatment (coffee) three-dose randomized cross-over design, with a washout period of 2 wks between visits.
RESULTS: CGAs, phenolic acids, and late-appearing metabolites all increased with increasing ingested dose. Hence, the sum of area under the curve was significantly higher for the medium to low dose, and high to medium dose, by 2.23- and 2.38-fold, respectively. CGAs were not well absorbed in their intact form, regardless of the dose. CGA and phenolic acids appeared rapidly in plasma, indicating an early absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. Late-appearing metabolites were the most abundant, regardless of the dose.

Twenty patients with partial or no immune response to HAART despite viral suppression were enrolled. Ten were randomized to stay on their current regimen and 10 were randomized to LPV/r plus their current NRTI backbone. T cell subsets, ex vivo apoptosis, and the percent of circulating cells with detectable intracellular HIV-1 RNA were measured.

LDL-C, however, does not always correlate with LDL-P because of the variable amounts of cholesterol per particle. Consideration of LDL-P concentrations in addition to LDL-C may help guide therapeutic decisions in a select number of patients. Evolocumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 that lowers both LDL-C and cardiovascular events. To evaluate the effect of evolocumab on serum levels and size of lipoprotein particles, we conducted a post hoc subanalysis of 619 patients from the Durable Effect of PCSK9 Antibody Compared with Placebo Study or DESCARTES trial, a 52-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, global study of patients with hyperlipidemia. At baseline, mean LDL-P concentration was 1077 nmol/L for the placebo group and 1100 nmol/L for the evolocumab group. In patients receiving evolocumab, week 52 total LDL-P concentration decreased to 610 nmol/L, a treatment difference of 50% versus placebo. Evolocumab also reduced concentrations of medium very low-density lipoprotein particles (VLDL-P), small VLDL-P, and intermediate-density lipoprotein particle: median (Q1, Q3) changes were -15.2% (-48, 48), -29% (-54, 18), and -36% (-70, 22), respectively.

Smoking cessation approaches that incorporate a focus on PA may benefit smokers trying to quit. The purpose of this study was to conduct a pilot randomized clinical trial to compare standard smoking cessation treatment (ST) with smoking cessation treatment that targets positive affect, termed positive psychotherapy for smoking cessation (PPT-S).
METHOD: Smokers who were seeking smoking cessation treatment were assigned by urn randomization to receive, along with 8 weeks of nicotine replacement therapy, either ST (n = 31) or PPT-S (n = 35). Seven-day point prevalence smoking abstinence was biochemically confirmed at 8, 16, and 26 weeks.
RESULTS: Compared to ST, a greater percentage of participants in PPT-S were abstinent at 8 weeks, 16 weeks, and 26 weeks, but these differences were nonsignificant.

An in-hospital and follow-up study.,"OBJECTIVES: To examine medication problems during a stay in hospital and after discharge and to identify risk factors that contribute to poor compliance with medication a prospective observational study was carried out in an university-affiliated geriatric hospital and a patients' home.
PATIENTS: One hundred and nineteen patients admitted from home to the geriatric hospital underwent a comprehensive geriatric assessment. They were also tested in opening and removing tablets from various common medicine containers. Drug prescriptions before, during and after the hospital stay were recorded. Medication use at home was observed by a member of a hospital-based home intervention team. The patients' reports of their drug therapy was compared with those by their family doctors.
RESULTS: Of all tested patients 10.1% failed to open at least one container. This inability was associated with poor vision, impaired cognitive function and low manual dexterity. Compliance with prescribed medication was associated with cognitive function, ability to handle medication containers, number of prescribed drugs and recent changes in drug prescriptions. Of the patients only 39.5% had stable drug prescriptions during the 3-month study period. Doctor/patient agreement concerning drug therapy was low in all age groups.

For meningitis in resource-limited settings, with high patient loads and limited financial resources, central nervous system diagnostic algorithms may be useful to guide diagnosis and treatment. However, the cost effectiveness of such algorithms is unknown.
METHODS: We used decision analysis methodology to evaluate the costs, diagnostic yield, and cost effectiveness of diagnostic strategies for adults with suspected meningitis in resource-limited settings with moderate/high HIV prevalence. We considered 3 strategies: (1) comprehensive ""shotgun"" approach of utilizing all routine tests; (2) ""stepwise"" strategy with tests performed in a specific order with additional tuberculosis (TB) diagnostics; (3) ""minimalist"" strategy of sequential ordering of high-yield tests only. Each strategy resulted in 1 of 4 meningitis diagnoses: bacterial (4%), cryptococcal (59%), TB (8%), or other (aseptic) meningitis (29%). In model development, we utilized prevalence data from 2 Ugandan sites and published data on test performance. We validated the strategies with data from Malawi, South Africa, and Zimbabwe.
RESULTS: The current comprehensive testing strategy resulted in 93.3% correct meningitis diagnoses costing $32.00 per patient. A stepwise strategy had 93.8% correct diagnoses costing an average of $9.72 per patient, and a minimalist strategy had 91.1% correct diagnoses costing an average of $6.17 per patient. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $133 per additional correct diagnosis for the stepwise over minimalist strategy.

Evidence from preclinical and clinical studies suggests that the glutamatergic neurotransmitter system might be an alternative treatment target. This study examined the efficacy of riluzole, a glutamatergic modulator, as an adjunctive therapy for children with treatment-resistant OCD. In a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 60 treatment-resistant children and adolescents (mean age=14.5 ± 2.4 years), with moderate to severe OCD (mean Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS)=28.2 ± 3.7), 17 of whom also had concomitant autism spectrum disorder, were randomized to receive riluzole (final dose of 100 mg/day) or placebo in addition to the existing treatment regimen. Fifty-nine subjects completed the randomized trial. Primary outcome measures were changes on the CY-BOCS, the Clinical Global Impressions Scale, and the Children's Global Assessment Scale. Riluzole was fairly well tolerated, although it was associated with one case of pancreatitis and five instances of slight increases in transaminases.

Changes in integrated electromyogram with respect to time (iEMG), vascular resistive index, and plasma lactate concentration were measured in five men either during or after elbow flexion exercises with the proximal end of the arm occluded at 0-100 mmHg. The mean iEMG, postexercise hyperemia, and plasma lactate concentration were all elevated with the increase in occlusion pressure at a low-intensity exercise, whereas they were unchanged with the increase in occlusion pressure at high-intensity exercise. To investigate the long-term effects of low-intensity exercise with occlusion, older women (n = 24) were subjected to a 16-wk exercise training for elbow flexor muscles, in which low-intensity [ approximately 50-30% one repetition maximum (1 RM)] exercise with occlusion at approximately 110 mmHg (LIO), low-intensity exercise without occlusion (LI), and high- to medium-intensity ( approximately 80-50% 1 RM) exercise without occlusion (HI) were performed. Percent increases in both cross-sectional area and isokinetic strength of elbow flexor muscles after LIO were larger than those after LI (P < 0.05) and similar to those after HI.

Previous trials suggest that the efficacy of antiresorptives on fractures might differ by patients' characteristics, such as age, bone mineral density (BMD), and fracture history. In the FREEDOM study, 7808 women aged 60 to 90 years with osteoporosis were randomly assigned to receive subcutaneous injections of denosumab (60 mg) or placebo every 6 months for 3 years. New vertebral and nonvertebral fractures were radiologically confirmed. Subgroup analyses described in this article were prospectively planned before study unblinding to evaluate the effect of denosumab on new vertebral and nonvertebral fractures across various subgroups. Compared with placebo, denosumab decreased the risk of new vertebral fractures in the overall study population over 3 years. This effect did not significantly differ for any of the nine subgroups analyzed (p > 0.09 for all potential interactions). Denosumab also reduced all nonvertebral fractures by 20% in the full study cohort over 3 years.

Another approach is the use of electrolyte-free PEG combined with 1.9 L of Gatorade. Despite its widespread use, there are no data on metabolic safety and minimal data on efficacy. Our aim was to assess the efficacy and electrolyte safety of these two PEG-based preparations.
METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized, single-blind, non-inferiority trial. Patients were randomized to 238 g PEG + 1.9 L Gatorade or 4 L of PEG-ELS containing 236 g PEG. Split dosing was not performed. On procedure day blood was drawn for basic chemistries. The primary outcome was preparation quality from procedure photos using the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale.
RESULTS: We randomized 136 patients (66 PEG + Gatorade, 70 PEG-ELS). There were no differences in preparation scores between the two agents in the ITT analysis (7.2 ± 1.9 for PEG-ELS and 7.0 ± 2.1 for PEG + Gatorade; p = 0.45). BBPS scores were identical for those who completed the preparation and dietary instructions as directed (7.4 ± 1.7 for PEG-ELS, and 7.4 ± 1.8 for PEG + Gatorade; p = 0.98). There were no statistical differences in serum electrolytes between the two preparations. Patients who received PEG + Gatorade gave higher overall satisfaction scores for the preparation experience (p = 0.001), and had fewer adverse effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of 238 g PEG + 1.9 L Gatorade appears to be safe, better tolerated, and non-inferior to 4 L PEG-ELS.

This study assessed the efficacy and safety of duloxetine in Chinese patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain.
METHODS: This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, flexible-dose study treated adult patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain and baseline Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) 24-hour average pain severity ratings ≥ 4 with duloxetine 60 mg to 120 mg once daily or placebo for 12 weeks.

RESULTS: Of 215 patients randomized, 88.4% and 82.1% of patients in placebo and duloxetine groups, respectively, completed the study. Mean change from baseline to endpoint in BPI average pain was not statistically different between the treatment groups (P = 0.124). Duloxetine- treated patients showed significantly greater pain reduction compared with those in placebo group at weeks 1, 2, and 4 (P = 0.004, P = 0.009, and P = 0.006, respectively), but not at weeks 8 (P = 0.125) and 12 (P = 0.107).

Various drugs have been studied using local delivery to improve the periodontal health and to achieve periodontal regeneration. Simvastatin (SMV) is a specific competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-2-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase. The present study was designed to investigate the effectiveness of SMV, 1.2 mg, in an indigenously prepared biodegradable controlled-release gel as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) in the treatment of chronic periodontitis.
METHODS: Sixty patients were categorized into two treatment groups: SRP plus placebo (group 1) and SRP plus SMV, 1.2 mg (group 2). Clinical parameters were recorded at baseline before SRP and at 1, 2, 4, and 6 months; they included modified sulcus bleeding index (mSBI), probing depth (PD), and clinical attachment level (CAL).

Background.- Telcagepant is a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist being investigated for the acute treatment of migraine.
METHODS: Migraine patients were randomized 2:1 to double-blind treatment with telcagepant 280/300 mg or rizatriptan 10 mg for an acute mild, moderate, or severe migraine. Patients could administer a second dose within 2-24 hours for nonresponse or migraine recurrence. Patients could treat up to 8 attacks per month for up to 18 months. Safety assessments included spontaneous reports of adverse events and collection of vital signs, electrocardiograms, and laboratory assessments.

Existing arthritis treatments yield small to moderate improvements in pain and have not been effective at reducing racial disparities in the management of pain. The biopsychosocial model of pain and evidence from the positive psychology literature suggest that increasing positive psychological skills (e.g., gratitude, kindness) could improve pain and functioning and reduce disparities in osteoarthritis pain management. Activities to cultivate positive psychological skills have been developed and validated; however, they have not been tested in patients with osteoarthritis, their effects on racial differences in health outcomes have not been examined, and evidence of their effects on health outcomes in patients with other chronic illnesses is of limited quality. In this article we describe the rationale and design of Staying Positive with Arthritis (SPA) study, a randomized controlled trial in which 180 African American and 180 White primary care patients with chronic pain from knee osteoarthritis will be randomized to a 6-week program of either positive skill-building activities or neutral control activities.

A better short-term appetite control has been described in active compared to sedentary men, and an exercise intervention was shown to improve appetite control in previously sedentary individuals. The mechanisms whereby exercise improves short-term appetite control remain obscure and although the changes in the postprandial release of satiety peptides are attractive hypotheses, it remains unproven. The impact of exercise on habitual food intake is also controversial and likely to be dependent on restraint level and body weight. We hypothesize that the beneficial impact of exercise on appetite regulation can contribute to its well-established efficacy in the prevention of weight regain in obese individuals.

Increases in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) develop in patients with HFpEF during exercise coupled with impaired nitric oxide (NO) signaling. Nitrite can be reduced to bioactive NO in vivo, particularly under conditions of tissue hypoxia, as with exercise.
OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine whether acute nitrite administration improves exercise hemodynamics and cardiac reserve in HFpEF.
METHODS: In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial, subjects with HFpEF (N = 28) underwent invasive cardiac catheterization with simultaneous expired gas analysis at rest and during exercise, before and 15 min after treatment with either sodium nitrite or matching placebo.
RESULTS: Before the study drug infusion, HFpEF subjects displayed an increase in PCWP with exercise from 16 ± 5 mm Hg to 30 ± 7 mm Hg (p < 0.0001). After study drug infusion, the primary endpoint of exercise PCWP was substantially improved by nitrite compared with placebo (adjusted mean: 19 ± 5 mm Hg vs. 28 ± 6 mm Hg; p = 0.0003). Nitrite-enhanced cardiac output reserve improved with exercise (+0.5 ± 0.7 l/min vs. -0.4 ± 0.7 l/min; p = 0.002) and normalized the increase in cardiac output relative to oxygen consumption. Nitrite improved pulmonary artery pressure-flow relationships in HFpEF and increased left ventricular stroke work with exercise versus placebo, indicating an improvement in ventricular performance with stress.
CONCLUSIONS: Acute sodium nitrite infusion favorably attenuates hemodynamic derangements of cardiac failure that develop during exercise in individuals with HFpEF.

A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is frequently used for pain conditions. While systematic reviews on MBSR for chronic pain have been conducted, there are no reviews for specific pain conditions. Therefore a systematic review of the effectiveness of MBSR in low back pain was performed.
METHODS: MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CAMBASE, and PsycInfo were screened through November 2011. The search strategy combined keywords for MBSR with keywords for low back pain. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing MBSR to control conditions in patients with low back pain were included. Two authors independently assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Clinical importance of group differences was assessed for the main outcome measures pain intensity and back-specific disability.
RESULTS: Three RCTs with a total of 117 chronic low back pain patients were included. One RCT on failed back surgery syndrome reported significant and clinically important short-term improvements in pain intensity and disability for MBSR compared to no treatment. Two RCTs on older adults (age ≥ 65 years) with chronic specific or non-specific low back pain reported no short-term or long-term improvements in pain or disability for MBSR compared to no treatment or health education. Two RCTs reported larger short-term improvements of pain acceptance for MBSR compared to no treatment.
CONCLUSION: This review found inconclusive evidence of effectiveness of MBSR in improving pain intensity or disability in chronic low back pain patients. However, there is limited evidence that MBSR can improve pain acceptance.

This study was conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of BoNT-A on pain and functional outcome in patients with chronic plantar fasciitis.
METHODS: In this short-term, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients (N=40) were randomized to receive 200 units of BoNT-A (Dysport) or saline placebo. The injection was administered in a fan-shaped manner directly at the calcaneal origin of the plantar fascia. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of responders at week 6 [≥50% decrease from baseline in pain score (visual analog scale) while moving during the previous 48 h).

METHODS AND RESULTS: OSICAT was a randomised, multicentre, open-label French study in 937 patients hospitalised for acute HF ≤12 months before inclusion. Patients were randomised to telemonitoring (daily body weight measurement, daily recording of HF symptoms, and personalised education) (n = 482) or to SC (n = 455). Mean ± standard deviation number of events for the primary outcome was 1.30 ± 1.85 for telemonitoring and 1.46 ± 1.98 for SC [rate ratio 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77-1.23; P = 0.80]. In New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV HF, median time to all-cause death or first unplanned hospitalisation was 82 days in the telemonitoring group and 67 days in the SC group (P = 0.03).

Research has demonstrated that contextual errors can be identified using standardized patients.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate an educational intervention designed to increase physicians' skills in incorporating the patient's context in assessment and management of care and to thereby decrease the rate of contextual errors.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Quasi-randomized controlled trial, with assessments by blinded observers. Fourth-year medical students (n = 124) in internal medicine subinternships at the University of Illinois at Chicago or Jesse Brown Veterans Administration Medical Center between July 2008 and April 2009 and between August 2009 and April 2010 participated and were assessed.
INTERVENTION: A 4-hour course on contextualization.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Probing for contextual issues in an encounter, probing for medical issues in an encounter, and developing an appropriate treatment plan. Outcomes were assessed using 4 previously validated standardized patient encounters performed by each participant and were adjusted for subinternship site, academic year, time of year, and case scenario.
RESULTS: Students who participated in the contextualization workshops were significantly more likely to probe for contextual issues in the standardized patient encounters than students who did not (90% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 87%-94% ] vs 62% [95% CI, 54%-69%], respectively) and significantly more likely to develop appropriate treatment plans for standardized patients with contextual issues (69% [95% CI, 57%-81%] vs 22% [95% CI, 12%-32%]. There was no difference between the groups in the rate of probing for medical issues (80% [95% CI, 75%-85%] vs 81% [95% CI, 76%-86%]) or developing appropriate treatment plans for standardized patients with medical issues (54% [95% CI, 42%-67%] vs 66% [95% CI, 53%-79%]).

D-serine is a naturally occurring NMDAR modulator that reverses the effects of NMDAR antagonists in animal models of schizophrenia. D-serine effects have been assessed previously for treatment of established schizophrenia, but not in the early stages of the disorder. We aimed to assess effects of D-serine on negative symptoms in at risk individuals.
METHODS: We did a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group randomised clinical trial at four academic US centres. Individuals were eligible for inclusion in the study if they were at clinical high risk of schizophrenia, aged between 13-35 years, had a total score of more than 20 on the Scale of Prodromal Symptoms (SOPS), and had an interest in participation in the clinical trial. Exclusion criteria included a history of suprathreshold psychosis symptoms (ie, no longer qualifying as prodromal) or clinical judgment that the reported symptoms from the SOPS were accounted for better by another disorder (eg, depression). Randomisation was done using a generated list with block sizes of four. Participants were stratified by site, with participants, investigators, and assessors all masked through use of identical looking placebos and centralised drug dispensation to study assignment. D-serine (60 mg/kg) was given orally in divided daily doses for 16 weeks. The primary endpoint was for negative SOPS, measured weekly for the first 6 weeks, then every 2 weeks. Participants who received at least one post-baseline assessment were included in analysis. Serum cytokine concentrations were collected at baseline, midpoint, and endpoint to assess the mechanism of action. Safety outcomes including laboratory assessments were obtained for all individuals. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT0082620.
FINDINGS: We enrolled participants between April 2, 2009, and July 23, 2012. 44 participants were randomly assigned to receive either D-serine (n=20) or placebo (n=24); 35 had assessable data (15 D-serine, 20 placebo). D-serine induced a 35·7% (SD 17·8) improvement in negative symptoms, which was significant compared with placebo (mean final SOPS negative score 7·6 [SEM 1·4] for D-serine group vs 11·3 [1·2] for placebo group; d=0·68, p=0·03). Five participants who received D-serine and nine participants who received placebo discontinued the study early because of withdrawn consent or loss to follow-up (n=8), conversion to psychosis (n=2), laboratory-confirmed adverse events (n=2), or protocol deviations (n=2).
INTERPRETATION: This study supports use of NMDAR-based interventions, such as D-serine, for treatment of prodromal symptoms of schizophrenia. On the basis of observed effect sizes, future studies with sample sizes of about 40 per treatment group would be needed for confirmation of beneficial effects on symptoms and NMDAR-related inflammatory changes. Long-term studies are needed to assess effects on psychosis conversion in individuals at clinical high risk of schizophrenia.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this international, phase III, double-blind trial, adult cancer subjects scheduled to receive ≥1 non-AC MEC on day 1 were randomized to a regimen comprising single-dose i.v. fosaprepitant 150 mg or placebo along with ondansetron and dexamethasone on day 1; control regimen recipients received ondansetron on days 2 and 3. Primary end points were the proportion of subjects achieving a complete response (CR; no vomiting and no use of rescue medication) in the delayed phase (25-120 h after MEC initiation) and safety. Secondary end points included CR in the overall and acute phases (0-120 and 0-24 h after MEC initiation, respectively) and no vomiting in the overall phase. Nausea and the Functional Living Index-Emesis were assessed as exploratory end points.
RESULTS: The fosaprepitant regimen improved CR significantly in the delayed (78.9% versus 68.5%; P < 0.001) and overall (77.1% versus 66.9%; P < 0.001) phases, but not in the acute phase (93.2% versus 91.0%; P = 0.184), versus control. In the overall phase, the proportion of subjects with no vomiting (82.7% versus 72.9%; P < 0.001) and no significant nausea (83.2% versus 77.9%; P = 0.030) was also significantly improved with the fosaprepitant regimen. The fosaprepitant regimen was generally well tolerated.
CONCLUSION: Single-dose fosaprepitant added to a 5-HT3 RA and dexamethasone was well tolerated and demonstrated superior control of CINV (primary end point achieved) associated with non-AC MEC. This is the first study to evaluate NK1 RA therapy as an i.v. formulation in a well-defined non-AC MEC population.

Despite a lack of consolidated evidence, Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) has become a popular alternative treatment for this condition. The aim of this study was to assess, with a rigidly designed study, the efficacy and safety of a CHM proprietary medicine, Hemp Seed Pill (HSP), in optimal dosage for treating FC.
METHODS: This study comprised two parts: trial I, a dose determination study, and trial II, a placebo-controlled clinical study. In trial I, the optimal dosage of HSP was first determined from among three doses (2.5, 5.0, and 7.5 g b.i.d.). In trial II, a randomized double-blind study, the efficacy and safety of HSP for FC patients (Rome III criteria) in excessive syndrome as defined by traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory were compared with placebo. All participants in trials underwent a 2-week run-in, an 8-week treatment, and an 8-week follow-up. The primary end point was the responder rate for complete spontaneous bowel movement (CSBM) during treatment. Participants with a mean increase of CSBM ≧ 1/week compared with their baselines were defined as responders. Secondary outcome measures included responder rate during follow-up, individual and global symptom assessments, and reported adverse effects (AEs).
RESULTS: The dose of 7.5 g b.i.d. showed better therapeutic effect than that of 2.5 and 5.0 g b.i.d. among 96 subjects (32 per arm) in trial I and was therefore selected for comparison with placebo in trial II. In trial II, 120 subjects were randomized into two arms (60 per arm). Responder rates for the HSP and placebo groups were 43.3 and 8.3% during treatment and 30.0 and 15.0% in the follow-up period, respectively (P<0.05). Those in the HSP group showed benefit in terms of increased CSBM, relief in the severity of constipation and straining of evacuation, and effective reduction in the use of rescue therapy when compared with placebo. No serious AE was reported.
CONCLUSIONS: HSP (7.5 g b.i.d.) is safe and effective for alleviating FC for subjects in excessive syndrome.

An intervention was tested to improve caregiver's perception of pain management and patient's pain.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The intervention was tested with a 2-group (usual care vs intervention) randomized controlled trial using parallel mixed-methods analysis of 446 caregivers in 3 Midwestern hospice programs representing rural and urban settings.
INTERVENTION: Web conferencing or telephones were used to connect caregivers with the hospice care team during care plan meetings.
MEASUREMENTS: Caregiver's perceptions of pain management were the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included caregiver quality of life, patient's pain, and anxiety. Video recordings, field notes, and caregiver and staff interviews provided qualitative data.
RESULTS: The overall perception of pain management was not changed by the participation in hospice team meetings. Perceptions of fatalism improved for intervention participants, and the intervention participants perceived their patients' pain was better controlled than those in the control group. The intervention was found to be feasible to deliver in rural areas. Caregiver's anxiety and patient's pain were correlated ( r = .18; P = .003), and subanalysis indicated that caregivers of patients with cancer may benefit more from the intervention than other hospice caregivers. Qualitative analyses provided understanding of caregiver's perceptions of pain, cost, and facilitators and barriers to routine involvement of family in care plan meetings. Limitations and Conclusion: The hospice philosophy is supportive of caregiver involvement in care planning, and technology makes this feasible; the intervention needs modification to become translational as well as additional measurement to assess effectiveness. Caregiver education and emotional support should occur outside the meeting, and a strong leader should facilitate the meeting to control efficiency. Finally, the intervention may benefit caregivers of patients with cancer more than others.",0,PRIMARY,Caregiver Perceptions of Pain Medicine Questionaire,This 16 question instrument measures the perceptions hospice caregivers have toward the administration of pain medications.

DESIGN: A double-blind before-after randomized placebo-controlled pilot study.
SETTING: Two public centres of Primary Health Care of the Spanish National Health System.
PARTICIPANTS: Fifty patients (29 women, 21 men) with a diagnosis of painful shoulder of subacromial origin were included.
INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly allocated to one of two groups. The intervention group (N = 25) was actually treated with diacutaneous fibrolysis, while the placebo group (N = 25) was treated with placebo diacutaneous fibrolysis.
MEASUREMENTS: Active range of motion (flexion, abduction, extension, external and internal rotation) and pain intensity in the hand-behind-back position were measured. Participants were also asked about their perception in terms of comfort of the technique and results obtained.
RESULTS: Between-groups differences were significant in flexion (mean 11.4 degrees; 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.7-17.1), abduction (mean 7.2 degrees; 95% CI 2.0-12.5) and internal rotation movements (mean 3.1 cm; 95% CI 0.1-6.1).

However, a variance in the response to loop diuretics can alter a patient's clinical course and has an adverse effect on clinical outcomes. Thus, a diminished response to loop diuretics is an important clinical issue. Factors thought to contribute to diuretic resistance include erratic oral absorption in congested states and postdiuretic sodium retention. Further contributing to diuretic resistance in patients with advanced heart failure are decreases in renal perfusion and alterations in sodium handling that occur in an attempt to maintain circulatory homeostasis. Several pharmacologic interventions have been used to improve diuretic response. Intravenous diuretic administration, increasing diuretic doses, or changing diuretic agents can potentially overcome pharmacokinetic obstacles which contribute to drug resistance. Combination diuretic therapy may be useful to overcome increased sodium retention, dopamine may improve renal perfusion, and hypertonic saline may transiently increase intravascular volume and improve sodium delivery to the tubules of the nephron. Despite the prevalence of diuretic resistance, there remains a paucity of clinical trial evidence to help guide therapy in these patients.",2,PRIMARY,Change in Total Body Water,"Measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis, compared to the initial measurement",Treatment Grup,Placebo,"This group will receive 3 milligrams of bumetanide plus 50 milligrams of chlorthalidone per day, for a week.

The clinical urgency of the method makes it important to study its results and theoretical underpinnings. Among the theoretical issues often raised in discussions on this modified form of psychoanalysis, those addressing the nature of communication between analyst, baby, and the mother are the most frequent. For example, how and what does an infant understand when the analyst interprets to her? What does the analyst understand of the infant's communication? These issues are addressed by investigating the infant's tools for understanding linguistic and emotional communication, and by providing a semiotic framework for describing the communication between the three participants in the analytic setting.

OBJECTIVES: The primary objectives were to determine the effect of SSC alone on pain from medical or nursing procedures in neonates undergoing painful procedures compared to no intervention, sucrose or other analgesics, or additions to simple SSC such as rocking; and the effects of the amount of SSC (duration in minutes) and the method of administration (who provided the SSC, positioning of caregiver and neonate pair).The secondary objectives were to determine the incidence of untoward effects of SSC and to compare the SSC effect in different postmenstrual age subgroups of infants.
SEARCH METHODS: The standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Collaborative Review Group were used. Databases searched in August 2011: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library); Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews; MEDLINE (1950 onwards); PubMed (1975 onwards); EMBASE (1974 onwards); CINAHL (1982 onwards); Web of Science (1980 onwards); LILACS database (1982 onwards); SCIELO database (1982 onwards); PsycInfo (1980 onwards); AMED (1985 onwards); Dissertation-Abstracts International (1980 onwards). Searches were conducted throughout September 2012.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies with randomisation or quasi-randomisation, double or single-blinded, involving term infants (> 37 completed weeks postmenstrual age (PMA)) to a maximum of 44 weeks PMA and preterm infants (< 37 completed weeks PMA) receiving SSC for painful procedures conducted by doctors, nurses, or other healthcare professionals.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The main outcome measures were physiological or behavioural pain indicators and composite pain scores. A weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) using a fixed-effect model was reported for continuous outcome measures. We included variations on type of tissue-damaging procedure, provider of care, and duration of SSC.
MAIN RESULTS: Nineteen studies (n = 1594 infants) were included. Fifteen studies (n = 744) used heel lance as the painful procedure, one study combined venepuncture and heel stick (n = 50), two used intramuscular injection, and one used 'vaccination' (n = 80). The studies that were included were generally strong and free from bias.Eleven studies (n = 1363) compared SSC alone to a no-treatment control. Although 11 studies measured heart rate during painful procedures, data from only four studies (n = 121) could be combined to give a mean difference (MD) of 0.35 beats per minute (95% CI -6.01 to 6.71). Three other studies that were not included in meta-analyses also reported no difference in heart rate after the painful procedure. Two studies reported heart rate variability outcomes and found no significant differences. Five studies used the Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) as a primary outcome, which favoured SCC at 30 seconds (n = 268) (MD -3.21, 95% CI -3.94 to -2.48), 60 seconds (n = 164) (MD -1.85, 95% CI -3.03 to -0.68), and 90 seconds (n = 163) (MD -1.34, 95% CI -2.56 to -0.13), but at 120 seconds (n = 157) there was no difference. No studies provided findings on return of heart rate to baseline level, oxygen saturation, cortisol levels, duration of crying, and facial actions that could be combined for analysis.Eight studies compared SSC to another intervention with or without a no-treatment control. Two cross-over studies (n = 80) compared mother versus other provider on PIPP scores at 30, 60, 90, and 120 seconds with no significant difference. When SSC was compared to other interventions, there were not enough similar studies to pool results in an analysis. One study compared SSC with and without dextrose and found that the combination was most effective and that SSC alone was more effective than dextrose alone. Similarly, in another study SSC was more effective than oral glucose for heart rate but not oxygen saturation. SSC either in combination with breastfeeding or alone was favoured over a no-treatment control, but was not different to breastfeeding. There were not enough participants with similar outcomes and painful procedures to compare age groups or duration of SSC. No adverse events were reported in any of the studies.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: SSC appears to be effective, as measured by composite pain indicators and including both physiological and behavioural indicators, and safe for a single painful procedure such as a heel lance. Purely behavioural indicators tended to favour SSC but there remains questionable bias regarding behavioural indicators. Physiological indicators were typically not different between conditions. Only two studies compared mother providers to others, with non-significant results. There was more heterogeneity in the studies with behavioural or composite outcomes. There is a need for replication studies that use similar, clearly defined outcomes.

There are few trials directly comparing the safety and efficacy of different intravenous iron products.
METHODS: This post-hoc analysis pooled data from 767 patients enrolled in two randomized, controlled, open-label trials of similar design comparing the treatment of iron deficiency anemia with ferumoxytol and iron sucrose across patients with all stages of renal function. One trial was conducted in adults with CKD either on or not on dialysis and the second in adults with IDA of any underlying cause and a history of unsatisfactory oral iron therapy or in whom oral iron could not be used who had normal to no worse than moderately impaired renal function. Patients were categorized by chronic kidney disease stage (i.e., estimated glomerular filtration rate), and the primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change in hemoglobin from Baseline to Week 5.
RESULTS: The overall incidence of adverse events was numerically lower in ferumoxytol-treated patients compared to those treated with iron sucrose (42.4 vs. 50.2 %, respectively); the incidence of treatment-related adverse events was generally similar between the two treatment groups (13.6 vs. 16.0 %, respectively). Adverse events of Special Interest (i.e., hypotension, hypersensitivity) occurred at lower rates in those treated with ferumoxytol compared to those treated with iron sucrose (2.5 vs. 5.3 %, respectively). Overall, mean hemoglobin increased in both treatment groups, regardless of degree of renal insufficiency, although greater increases were seen among those with less severe kidney damage. Mean increases in hemoglobin from Baseline to Week 5 were significantly greater with ferumoxytol than with iron sucrose treatment in the subgroup with an estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥90 mL/min (Least Squares mean difference = 0.53 g/dL; p < 0.001). There were no other consistent, significant differences in hemoglobin levels between treatment groups for the other chronic kidney disease categories except for isolated instances favoring ferumoxytol.
CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy and safety of ferumoxytol is at least comparable to iron sucrose in patients with varying degrees of renal function.

Multiple vascular sealants have been used as adjuncts to surgical procedures, but none of them have been universally successful. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a new prophylactic vascular sealant in arterial surgery.
METHODS: A randomized prospective multi-institutional trial was undertaken comparing ArterX Vascular Sealant (AVS) with Gelfoam Plus during open arterial reconstruction.
RESULTS: Three hundred thirty-one anastomotic sites in 217 patients were randomized. One hundred one of 167 (60.5%) anastomotic sites in the AVS group achieved immediate hemostasis compared with 65 of 164 (39.6%) in the control group (P = 0.001). In anastomoses with polytetrafluoroethylene grafts, 105 of 167 (62.5%) in the AVS group achieved immediate hemostasis compared with 56 of 164 (34.0%) in the control group (P < 0.001). No significant differences were noted in morbidity or mortality. Operative time was significantly less in the AVS group compared with the control group (3.2 vs. 3.8 hours, P < 0.01).

Its prevalence rate ranged from 11 to 80 percent in all the adult patients. Delay in wound healing and increasing use of narcotics and anesthetics are some of the other accompanying problems. Aromatherapy is one of the complementary medicine components. It is applied by special type of oil extracted from aromatic plants for medical objectives. This study aimed to investigate the effects of inhalation aromatherapy on anxiety level in preoperative patients.
METHODS: This was a clinical study done on 72 patients candidate for heart and abdominal surgery admitted in Golestan and Imam Khomeini hospitals. The patients were selected according to our study objectives and inclusion criteria. Then, they were divided in two case and control groups. The Spielberger scale was used for evaluating the anxiety level. Twenty minute of inhalation with handkerchief containing lavandula was used in the case group and placebo also (water) in the control group.
RESULTS: The average of anxiety level in inhalation aromatherapy group decreased from 51.00 to 38.61 from before to after the intervention. This average in the inhalation group with placebo was 50.67 before the intervention and decreased to 49.53 after the intervention.

METHODS: Fifty healthy patients undergoing elective shoulder arthroscopy under general anesthesia were randomly assigned to either the control group (n = 25) or SCD group (n = 25). A standardized protocol for pre-hydration and anesthetic technique was followed. Hemodynamic variables were measured before (pre-induction values) and 5 minutes after the induction of anesthesia in the supine position (baseline values) and 1, 3, and 5 minutes after the patient was raised to a 70 degrees sitting position. The incidence of hypotension was recorded and treated with ephedrine.
RESULTS: The incidence of hypotension was significantly higher in the control group (16 of 25) than that in the SCD group (7 of 25) (P = .022; odds ratio, 0.219; 95% confidence interval, 0.066 to 0.723).

OBJECTIVE: To determine if administration of BMCs through transendocardial injections improves myocardial perfusion, reduces left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV), or enhances maximal oxygen consumption in patients with coronary artery disease or LV dysfunction, and limiting heart failure or angina.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A phase 2 randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of symptomatic patients (New York Heart Association classification II-III or Canadian Cardiovascular Society classification II-IV) with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 45% or less, a perfusion defect by single-photon emission tomography (SPECT), and coronary artery disease not amenable to revascularization who were receiving maximal medical therapy at 5 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-sponsored Cardiovascular Cell Therapy Research Network (CCTRN) sites between April 29, 2009, and April 18, 2011.
INTERVENTION: Bone marrow aspiration (isolation of BMCs using a standardized automated system performed locally) and transendocardial injection of 100 million BMCs or placebo (ratio of 2 for BMC group to 1 for placebo group).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Co-primary end points assessed at 6 months: changes in LVESV assessed by echocardiography, maximal oxygen consumption, and reversibility on SPECT. Phenotypic and functional analyses of the cell product were performed by the CCTRN biorepository core laboratory.
RESULTS: Of 153 patients who provided consent, a total of 92 (82 men; average age: 63 years) were randomized (n = 61 in BMC group and n = 31 in placebo group). Changes in LVESV index (-0.9 mL/m(2) [95% CI, -6.1 to 4.3]; P = .73), maximal oxygen consumption (1.0 [95% CI, -0.42 to 2.34]; P = .17), and reversible defect (-1.2 [95% CI, -12.50 to 10.12]; P = .84) were not statistically significant. There were no differences found in any of the secondary outcomes, including percent myocardial defect, total defect size, fixed defect size, regional wall motion, and clinical improvement.

These ""disruptive"" children were randomly assigned to four treatment conditions lasting the kindergarten school year: no treatment, parent training only, full-day treatment classroom only, and the combination of parent training with the classroom treatment. Results showed that parent training produced no significant treatment effects, probably owing largely to poor attendance. The classroom treatment produced improvement in multiple domains: parent ratings of adaptive behavior, teacher ratings of attention, aggression, self-control, and social skills, as well as direct observations of externalizing behavior in the classroom. Neither treatment improved academic achievement skills or parent ratings of home behavior problems, nor were effects evident on any lab measures of attention, impulse control, or mother-child interactions. It is concluded that when parent training is offered at school registration to parents of disruptive children identified through a brief school registration screening, it may not be a useful approach to treating the home and community behavioral problems of such children. The kindergarten classroom intervention was far more effective in reducing the perceived behavioral problems and impaired social skills of these children.

Novel methods are needed to improve adherence for warfarin. We conducted two pilot studies to determine whether a lottery-based daily financial incentive is feasible and improves warfarin adherence and anticoagulation control.
METHODS: Volunteers from the University of Pennsylvania Anticoagulation Management Center who had taken warfarin for at least 3 months participated in either a pilot study with a lottery with a daily expected value of $5 (N = 10) or a daily expected value of $3 (N = 10). All subjects received use of an Informedix Med-eMonitor System with a daily reminder feature. If subjects opened up their pill compartments appropriately, they were entered into a daily lottery with a 1 in 5 chance of winning $10 and a 1 in 100 chance of winning $100 (pilot 1) or a 1 in 10 chance of winning $10 and a 1 in 100 chance of winning $100 (pilot 2). The primary study outcome was proportion of incorrect warfarin doses. The secondary outcome was proportion of INR measurements not within therapeutic range. Within-subject pre-post comparisons were done of INR measurements with comparisons with either historic means or within-subject comparisons of incorrect warfarin doses.
RESULTS: In the first pilot, the percent of out-of-range INRs decreased from 35.0% to 12.2% during the intervention, before increasing to 42% post-intervention. The mean proportion of incorrect pills taken during the intervention was 2.3% incorrect pills, compared with a historic mean of 22% incorrect pill taking in this clinic population. Among the five subjects who also had MEMS cap adherence data from warfarin use in our prior study, mean incorrect pill taking decreased from 26% pre-pilot to 2.8% in the pilot. In the second pilot, the time out of INR range decreased from 65.0% to 40.4%, with the proportion of mean incorrect pill taking dropping to 1.6%.
CONCLUSION: A daily lottery-based financial incentive demonstrated the potential for significant improvements in missed doses of warfarin and time out of INR range.

7082,NCT04048382,Patient Navigation (PN) is superior to Usual Care (UC) in terms of Percent of Participants That Received a PrEP Prescription. 3 months,26606148,"Vital Signs: Estimated Percentages and Numbers of Adults with Indications for Preexposure Prophylaxis to Prevent HIV Acquisition--United States, 2015.","BACKGROUND: In 2014, approximately 40,000 persons in the United States received a diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with daily oral antiretroviral medication is a new, highly effective intervention that could reduce the number of new HIV infections.
METHODS: CDC analyzed nationally representative data to estimate the percentages and numbers of persons in the United States, by transmission risk group, with indications for PrEP consistent with the 2014 U.S. Public Health Service's PrEP clinical practice guideline.
RESULTS: Approximately 24.7% of sexually active adult men who have sex with men (MSM) (492,000 [95% confidence interval {CI} = 212,000-772,000]), 18.5% of persons who inject drugs (115,000 [CI = 45,000-185,000]), and 0.4% of heterosexually active adults (624,000 [CI = 404,000-846,000]), had substantial risks for acquiring HIV consistent with PrEP indications.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on current guidelines, many MSM, persons who inject drugs, and heterosexually active adults have indications for PrEP. A higher percentage of MSM and persons who inject drugs have indications for PrEP than heterosexually active adults, consistent with distribution of new HIV diagnoses across these populations.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTICE: Clinical organizations, health departments, and community-based organizations should raise awareness of PrEP among persons with substantial risk for acquiring HIV infection and their health care providers. These data can be used to inform scale-up and evaluation of PrEP coverage. Increasing delivery of PrEP and other highly effective HIV prevention services could lower the number of new HIV infections occurring in the United States each year.",2,PRIMARY,Percent of Participants That Received a PrEP Prescription.,Participants will be asked if they have received a PrEP prescription on a follow up questionnaire.

METHODS: The adhesion of 111In labelled human platelets to transfected HUVEC (SGHEC-7) was measured either alone or after incubation of SGHEC-7 cells for 18 h with interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and/or tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha). The activity of NO synthase in these cells was measured by formation of citrulline. The effects of dexamethasone (0.3 microM) and NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA, 100 microM) on these two variables were determined.
RESULTS: Stimulation of SGHEC-7 cells with IL-1 beta or TNF alpha (each at 1-30 ng.ml-1) caused them to express the inducible NO synthase, an effect that was prevented by dexamethasone. Platelet adhesion to unstimulated SGHEC-7 cells was < 0.1% (n = 3) and was increased to 0.7 (SEM 0.2)% by L-NMMA but was not affected by dexamethasone. Stimulation of the cells with IL-1 beta and TNF alpha increased platelet adhesion to a maximum of 2.2(0.4)%. This increase was enhanced by both dexamethasone and L-NMMA. The effect of L-NMMA was prevented by L-arginine.
CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of NO synthesis by L-NMMA potentiates platelet adhesion to unstimulated SGHEC-7 cells, showing that basally released NO regulates platelet adhesion. Stimulation of SGHEC-7 cells by cytokines increases their adhesive properties but at the same time causes them to express the inducible NO synthase. Nitric oxide generated by this enzyme contributes to the modulation of the adhesive properties of the endothelial cells. Thus both constitutive and inducible NO synthases modulate endothelial cell thrombogenicity.",2,PRIMARY,Methemoglobin Level-End of CPB,Methemoglobin Level obtained at the end of cardiopulmonary bypass,Nitric Oxide,Placebo,"20 ppm of Nitric Oxide delivered to the oxygenator via the INOmax device for the duration of the cardiopulmonary bypass time

Peri-implant and/or gingival samples from loosened implants, chronic periodontitis (CP), and normal controls (n = 10 samples in each group) were analyzed using immunohistochemical staining to observe tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 1-alpha (IL-1alpha), IL-6, platelet-derived growth factor A (PDGF-A), and transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha). These cytokines were found in foreign-body giant cells, macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells. TNF-alpha, IL-1alpha, and IL-6 were increased (P < .05; unpaired t test) in peri-implantitis and CP, whereas PDGF-A and TGF-alpha were not. In conclusion, cytokines with a potential to activate osteoclasts were found in both peri-implantitis and CP, but the cytokine profiles differed in that IL-1alpha was the most prevalent cytokine in the former and TNF-alpha was the most common in the latter.

METHODS: The medline, Cochrane Library, embase, cambase, and PsycInfo databases were screened through November 2011. The search strategy combined keywords for mbsr and mbct with keywords for breast cancer. Randomized controlled trials (rcts) comparing mbsr or mbct with control conditions in patients with breast cancer were included. Two authors independently used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess risk of bias in the selected studies. Study characteristics and outcomes were extracted by two authors independently. Primary outcome measures were health-related quality of life and psychological health. If at least two studies assessing an outcome were available, standardized mean differences (smds) and 95% confidence intervals (cis) were calculated for that outcome. As a measure of heterogeneity, I(2) was calculated.
RESULTS: Three rcts with a total of 327 subjects were included. One rct compared mbsr with usual care, one rct compared mbsr with free-choice stress management, and a three-arm rct compared mbsr with usual care and with nutrition education. Compared with usual care, mbsr was superior in decreasing depression (smd: -0.37; 95% ci: -0.65 to -0.08; p = 0.01; I(2) = 0%) and anxiety (smd: -0.51; 95% ci: -0.80 to -0.21; p = 0.0009; I(2) = 0%), but not in increasing spirituality (smd: 0.27; 95% ci: -0.37 to 0.91; p = 0.41; I(2) = 79%).

The Neonatology Committee for the Developmental Network.,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the hypothesis that variation in respiratory management among newborn intensive care units (NICUs) explains differences in chronic lung disease (CLD) rates.
DESIGN: Case-cohort study.
SETTING: NICUs at 1 medical center in New York (Babies' and Children's Hospital [Babies']) and 2 in Boston (Beth Israel Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital [Boston]).
STUDY POPULATION: Four hundred fifty-two infants born at 500 to 1500 g birth weight between January 1991 and December 1993, who were enrolled in an epidemiologic study of neonatal intracranial white matter disorders.
CASE DEFINITION: Supplemental oxygen required at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age.
RESULTS: The prevalence rates of CLD differed substantially between the centers: 4% at Babies' and 22% at the 2 Boston hospitals, despite similar mortality rates. Initial respiratory management at Boston was more likely than at Babies' to include mechanical ventilation (75% vs 29%) and surfactant treatment (45% vs 10%). Case and control infants at Babies' were more likely than were those at Boston to have higher partial pressure of carbon dioxide and lower pH values on arterial blood gases. However, measures of oxygenation and ventilator settings among case and control infants were similar at the 2 medical centers in time-oriented logistic regression analyses. In multivariate logistic regression analyses, the initiation of mechanical ventilation was associated with increased risk of CLD: after adjusting for other potential confounding factors, the odds ratios for mechanical ventilation were 13.4 on day of birth, 9.6 on days 1 to 3, and 6.3 on days 4 to 7. Among ventilated infants, CLD risk was elevated for maximum peak inspiratory pressure >25 and maximum fraction of inspired oxygen = 1.0 on the day of birth, lowest peak inspiratory pressure >20 and maximum partial pressure of carbon dioxide >50 on days 1 to 3, and lowest white blood count <8 K on days 4 to 7. Even after adjusting for white blood count <8 K and the 4 respiratory care variables, infants in Boston continued to be at increased risk of CLD, compared with premature infants at Babies' Hospital.
CONCLUSION: In multivariate analyses, a number of specific measures of respiratory care practice during the first postnatal week were associated with the risk of a very low birth weight infant developing CLD. However, after adjusting for baseline risk, most of the increased risk of CLD among very low birth weight infants hospitalized at 2 Boston NICUs, compared with those at Babies' Hospital, was explained simply by the initiation of mechanical ventilation.",2,PRIMARY,Need for Endotracheal Ventilation in the First 72 hs of Life,number of participants that needed endotracheal ventilation (failed non invasive ventilation) in the first 72 hours of life,NIPPV,NCPAP,preterm infants with nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation as a primary mode of respiratory support,preterm infants with nasal continuous positive pressure as the mode of respiratory support,DEVICE,DEVICE,EXPERIMENTAL,ACTIVE_COMPARATOR,['<0.05'],['risk ratio (RR)'],['Superiority or Other'],2000-Jun-N/A

Xylitol, a naturally occurring sugar alcohol, can reduce AOM when given 5 times per day as a gum or syrup, but a more convenient dosing regimen is needed for widespread adoption.
METHODS: We designed a pragmatic practice-based randomized controlled trial to determine if viscous xylitol solution at a dose of 5 g 3 times per day could reduce the occurrence of clinically diagnosed AOM among otitis-prone children 6 months through 5 years of age.
RESULTS: A total of 326 subjects were enrolled, with 160 allocated to xylitol and 166 to placebo. In the primary analysis of time to first clinically diagnosed AOM episode, the hazard ratio for xylitol versus placebo recipients was 0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61 to 1.3). In secondary analyses, the incidence of AOM was 0.53 episodes per 90 days in the xylitol group versus 0.59 in the placebo group (difference 0.06; 95% CI -0.25 to 0.13); total antibiotic use was 6.8 days per 90 days in the xylitol group versus 6.4 in the placebo group (difference 0.4; 95% CI -1.8 to 2.7).

Participants then engaged in 2 laboratory-evoked pain tasks (ischemic and thermal). Outcomes included pain threshold, pain tolerance, and pain ratings. Indexes of EO function and morphine analgesic responsiveness were derived for each measure as the difference in pain responses between the placebo condition and naloxone or morphine condition, respectively. For all 7 pain measures across the 2 laboratory pain tasks, greater EO function was associated with significantly lower morphine analgesic responsiveness (P<0.001-P=0.02). Morphine reduced pain responses of low EO individuals to levels similar to those of high EO individuals receiving placebo. Higher placebo condition-evoked pain sensitivity was associated with significantly greater morphine analgesic responsiveness for 5 of 7 pain measures (P<0.001-P=0.02). These latter associations were significantly mediated by EO function for 4 of these 5 pain outcomes (all P values<0.05).

In a pilot trial in young adults with Down syndrome, memantine (a drug approved for Alzheimer's disease) showed a significant effect on a secondary measure of episodic memory. We aimed to test whether memantine would improve episodic memory in adolescents and young adults with Down syndrome.
METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial with a parallel design, stratified by age and sex. Participants (aged 15-32 years) with either trisomy 21 or complete unbalanced translocation of chromosome 21 and in general good health were recruited from the community at one site in Brazil and another in the USA. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either memantine (20 mg/day orally) or placebo for 16 weeks. Computer-generated randomisation tables for both sites (allocating a placebo or drug label to each member of a unique pair of participants) were centrally produced by an independent statistician and were shared only with investigational pharmacists at participating sites until unblinding of the study. Participants and investigators were masked to treatment assignments. Neuropsychological assessments were done at baseline (T1) and week 16 (T2). The primary outcome measure was change from baseline to week 16 in the California Verbal Learning Test-second edition short-form (CVLT-II-sf) total free recall score, assessed in the per-protocol population (ie, participants who completed 16 weeks of treatment and had neuropsychological assessments at T1 and T2). Linear mixed effect models were fit to data from the per-protocol population. Safety and tolerability were monitored and analysed in all participants who started treatment. Steady-state concentrations in plasma of memantine were measured at the end of the trial. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02304302.
FINDINGS: From May 13, 2015, to July 22, 2020, 185 participants with Down syndrome were assessed for eligibility and 160 (86%) were randomly assigned either memantine (n=81) or placebo (n=79). All participants received their allocated treatment. Linear mixed effect models were fit to data from 149 (81%) participants, 73 in the memantine group and 76 in the placebo group, after 11 people (eight in the memantine group and three in the placebo group) discontinued due to COVID-19 restrictions, illness of their caregiver, adverse events, or low compliance. The primary outcome measure did not differ between groups (CVLT-II-sf total free recall score, change from baseline 0·34 points [95% CI -0·98 to 1·67], p=0·61). Memantine was well tolerated, with infrequent mild-to-moderate adverse events, the most common being viral upper respiratory infection (nine [11%] participants in the memantine group and 12 [15%] in the placebo group) and transient dizziness (eight [10%] in the memantine group and six [8%] in the placebo group). No serious adverse events were observed. Amounts of memantine in plasma were substantially lower than those considered therapeutic for Alzheimer's disease.
INTERPRETATION: Memantine was well tolerated, but cognition-enhancing effects were not recorded with a 20 mg/day dose in adolescents and young adults with Down syndrome. Exploratory analyses point to a need for future work.

This study examined the cost-effectiveness of EMR-based CDS for adults with diabetes from the perspective of the health care system.
DATA SOURCES/SETTING: Clinical outcome and cost data from a randomized clinical trial of EMR-based CDS were used as inputs into a diabetes simulation model. The simulation cohort included 1,092 patients with diabetes with A1c above goal at baseline.
STUDY DESIGN: The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study Outcomes Model, a validated simulation model of diabetes, was used to evaluate remaining life years, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and health care costs over patient lifetimes (40-year time horizon) from the health system perspective.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Patients in the intervention group had significantly lowered A1c (0.26 percent, p = .014) relative to patients in the control arm. Intervention costs were $120 (SE = 45) per patient in the first year and $76 (SE = 45) per patient in the following years. In the base case analysis, EMR-based CDS increased lifetime QALYs by 0.04 (SE = 0.01) and increased lifetime costs by $112 (SE = 660), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $3,017 per QALY. The cost-effectiveness of EMR-based CDS persisted in one-way, two-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.

Two major types of vascular-targeting agent (VTA) have now emerged: those that prevent the angiogenic development of the neovasculature of the tumor and those that specifically damage the already established tumor vascular supply. When used alone neither approach readily leads to tumor control, and so, for VTAs to be most successful in the clinic they will need to be combined with more conventional therapies.

This study investigated whether cigarette demand predicted response to contingent monetary rewards for abstinence among individuals with substance use disorders. It also sought to replicate evidence for greater price sensitivity at whole-dollar pack price transitions (ie, left-digit effects).
METHODS: Participants (N = 338) were individuals in residential substance use disorder treatment who participated in a randomized controlled trial that compared contingent vouchers to noncontingent vouchers for smoking abstinence. Baseline demand indices were used to predict number of abstinent days during the 14-day voucher period (after the reduction lead-in) and at 1 and 3 months afterward.
RESULTS: Demand indices correlated with measures of smoking and nicotine dependence. As measured by elasticity, intensity and O max, higher demand significantly predicted fewer abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings during voucher period for individuals in the noncontingent vouchers condition. Breakpoint exhibited a trend-level association with abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings. Demand indices did not predict abstinence in the contingent vouchers group, and did not predict abstinence at 1- and 3-month follow-ups. Left-digit price transitions were associated with significantly greater reductions in consumption.
CONCLUSIONS: The association of cigarette demand with smoking behavior only in the group for whom abstinence was not incentivized indicates that CPT assesses the value of smoking more than the value of money per se and that vouchers counteract the effects of the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes. Results provide initial short-term evidence of predictive validity for the CPT indices.
IMPLICATIONS: This study provides the first evidence of the validity of the CPT for predicting early response to brief advice for smoking cessation plus nicotine replacement in smokers with substance dependence. However, demand for cigarettes did not predict voucher-based treatment response, indicating that incentives serve as a powerful motivator not to smoke that acts in opposition to the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes and that the indices reflect the value of smoking more than the value of money per se.",0,PRIMARY,Number of Participants With Relapse to Any Heavy Drinking,Heavy drinking = 6 or more drinks for men; 5 or more drinks for women,Contingency Management (CM),Noncontingent Reinforcement (NR),"Condition provides contingent monetary reinforcement for smoking reductions (first 5 days) then for smoking abstinence (subsequent 14 days).

The authors designed a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, pilot study in which migraineurs who also had insomnia were enrolled, to test this observation.
METHODOLOGY: In the study, the authors treated 79 subjects with IHS-II migraine with and/or without aura and with DSM-IV primary insomnia for 6 weeks with 3 mg eszopiclone (Lunesta(®)) or placebo at bedtime. The treatment was preceded by a 2-week baseline period and followed by a 2-week run-out period.
RESULTS: Of the 79 subjects treated, 75 were evaluable, 35 in the eszopiclone group, and 40 in the placebo group. At baseline, the groups were comparable except for sleep latency. Of the three remaining sleep variables, total sleep time, nighttime awakenings, and sleep quality, the number of nighttime awakenings during the 6-week treatment period was significantly lower in the eszopiclone group than in the placebo group (P = 0.03).

These rate changes represent 4522 additional doses in the Intervention arm vs. 1390 additional doses in the Control arm. This effect of the intervention was observed despite the fact that rates increased significantly in both arms - 8/10 Intervention (all P<0.001) and 7/10 Control sites (P-values=0.04 to <0.001). Rates in two Intervention sites with pre-intervention vaccination rates >58% did not significantly increase. In regression analyses, a child's likelihood of being vaccinated was significantly higher with: younger age, white race (Odds ratio [OR]=1.29; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.23-1.34), having commercial insurance (OR=1.30; 95%CI=1.25-1.35), higher pre-intervention practice vaccination rate (OR=1.25; 95%CI=1.16-1.34), and being in the Intervention arm (OR=1.23; 95%CI=1.01-1.50). Early delivery of influenza vaccine was rated by Intervention practices as an effective strategy for raising rates.
CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a multi-strategy toolkit and early vaccine supplies can significantly improve influenza vaccination rates among children in primary care practices but the effect may be less pronounced in practices with moderate to high existing vaccination rates.

However, most cases of advanced disease eventually progress. Pertuzumab, an anti-HER2 humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits receptor dimerization, has a mechanism of action that is complementary to that of trastuzumab, and combination therapy with the two antibodies has shown promising activity and an acceptable safety profile in phase 2 studies involving patients with HER2-positive breast cancer.
METHODS: We randomly assigned 808 patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer to receive placebo plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel (control group) or pertuzumab plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel (pertuzumab group) as first-line treatment until the time of disease progression or the development of toxic effects that could not be effectively managed. The primary end point was independently assessed progression-free survival. Secondary end points included overall survival, progression-free survival as assessed by the investigator, the objective response rate, and safety.
RESULTS: The median progression-free survival was 12.4 months in the control group, as compared with 18.5 months in the pertuzumab group (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.51 to 0.75; P<0.001). The interim analysis of overall survival showed a strong trend in favor of pertuzumab plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel. The safety profile was generally similar in the two groups, with no increase in left ventricular systolic dysfunction; the rates of febrile neutropenia and diarrhea of grade 3 or above were higher in the pertuzumab group than in the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of pertuzumab plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel, as compared with placebo plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel, when used as first-line treatment for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, significantly prolonged progression-free survival, with no increase in cardiac toxic effects.

An interview-based rating scale, the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale-heavy drinkers (YBOCS-hd), has been found useful in quantifying this concept in alcohol-dependent individuals. A self-rating scale, the Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS) has been developed by us as a modification of the YBOCS-hd. The YBOCS-hd showed excellent interrater reliability in our hands. The correlation between the YBOCS-hd and the OCDS total scores obtained on 60 alcohol-dependent individuals was 0.83. The test-retest correlation for the OCDS total score was 0.96, and the obsessive and compulsive subscales test-retest correlations were 0.94 and 0.86, respectively. The internal consistency of the items in the OCDS was high (0.86) and did not improve significantly with removal of individual items. The shared variance between the OCDS scores and alcohol consumption during the period of evaluation was only approximately 20%, indicating that the dimension measured by the scale was somewhat independent of actual drinking. As such, it might act as an independent measure of the ""state of illness"" for alcohol-dependent individuals.

Diagnosis and staging working group report.,"This consensus document is intended to serve 3 functions. First, it standardizes the criteria for diagnosis of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Second, it proposes a new clinical scoring system (0-3) that describes the extent and severity of chronic GVHD for each organ or site at any given time, taking functional impact into account. Third, it proposes new guidelines for global assessment of chronic GVHD severity that are based on the number of organs or sites involved and the degree of involvement in affected organs (mild, moderate, or severe). Diagnosis of chronic GVHD requires the presence of at least 1 diagnostic clinical sign of chronic GVHD (e.g., poikiloderma or esophageal web) or the presence of at least 1 distinctive manifestation (e.g., keratoconjunctivitis sicca) confirmed by pertinent biopsy or other relevant tests (e.g., Schirmer test) in the same or another organ. Furthermore, other possible diagnoses for clinical symptoms must be excluded. No time limit is set for the diagnosis of chronic GVHD. The Working Group recognized 2 main categories of GVHD, each with 2 subcategories. The acute GVHD category is defined in the absence of diagnostic or distinctive features of chronic GVHD and includes (1) classic acute GVHD occurring within 100 days after transplantation and (2) persistent, recurrent, or late acute GVHD (features of acute GVHD occurring beyond 100 days, often during withdrawal of immune suppression). The broad category of chronic GVHD includes (1) classic chronic GVHD (without features or characteristics of acute GVHD) and (2) an overlap syndrome in which diagnostic or distinctive features of chronic GVHD and acute GVHD appear together.

Dapagliflozin is an orally active, highly selective SGLT2 inhibitor that improves glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by reducing renal glucose reabsorption leading to urinary glucose excretion (glucuresis). Orally administered dapagliflozin is rapidly absorbed generally achieving peak plasma concentrations within 2 h. Dose-proportional systemic exposure to dapagliflozin has been observed over a wide dose range (0.1-500 mg) with an oral bioavailability of 78 %. Dapagliflozin has extensive extravascular distribution (mean volume of distribution of 118 L). Dapagliflozin metabolism occurs predominantly in the liver and kidneys by uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase-1A9 to the major metabolite dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide (this metabolite is not an SGLT2 inhibitor at clinically relevant exposures). Dapagliflozin is not appreciably cleared by renal excretion (<2 % of dose is recovered in urine as parent). Dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide elimination occurs mainly via renal excretion, with 61 % of a dapagliflozin dose being recovered as this metabolite in urine. The half-life for orally administered dapagliflozin 10 mg was 12.9 h. Maximal increases in urinary glucose excretion were seen at doses ≥20 mg/day in patients with T2DM. No clinically relevant differences were observed in dapagliflozin exposure with respect to age, race, sex, body weight, food, or presence of T2DM. Pharmacodynamic changes are dependent on plasma glucose and renal function, and decreases in urinary glucose excretion were observed due to the lower filtered load (plasma glucose × glomerular filtration rate) in healthy volunteers compared to subjects with T2DM. After multiple doses of dapagliflozin, urinary glucose excretion was associated with dose-related decreases in plasma glucose parameters in subjects with T2DM. Patients with severe renal or hepatic impairment show higher systemic exposure to dapagliflozin.

Peripyloric antral biopsy specimens were obtained from 50 consecutive patients with dyspepsia undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The macroscopic gastrointestinal damage and the histologic grades of antral gastritis were scored by a modified Lanza scale and Sydney system, respectively. In addition, the densities of antral H. pylori colonization were graded semiquantitatively. Serum IgG antibodies to H. pylori were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Thirty-six (M/F = 29/7) of the 50 patients had H. pylori infection documented by histologic examination or rapid urease test or both. Among the subjects, the IgG antibody titers to H. pylori correlated significantly with the grades of antral polymorphonuclear cell infiltration (p = 0.002) and antral bacterial density (p = 0.01) but not with endoscopic scores, the grades of mononuclear cell infiltration, mucosal atrophy, or intestinal metaplasia (p > 0.05). In addition, endoscopic scores also were found to be significantly correlated with antral bacterial density (p = 0.049) and the grade of polymorphonuclear cell infiltration (p = 0.012).

The ideal regimen would balance efficacy for maintaining uteroplacental perfusion pressure against potential for uteroplacental vasoconstriction, both of which may affect fetal acid-base status. We compared phenylephrine infusion regimens based on three different BP thresholds.
METHODS: After intrathecal injection, we infused phenylephrine 100 microg min(-1) for 2 min. Then, until delivery, we infused phenylephrine whenever systolic BP (SBP), measured every 1 min, was below a randomly assigned percentage of baseline: 100% (Group 100, n=25), 90% (Group 90, n=25) or 80% (Group 80, n=24). We compared umbilical blood gases, Apgar scores and maternal haemodynamics and symptoms.
RESULTS: Patients in Group 100 had fewer episodes [median 0 (range 0-8)] of hypotension (SBP <80% baseline) compared with Group 80 [5 (0-18)] and Group 90 [2 (0-7)] (P<0.001 in each instance).

A GICOR study.,"PURPOSE: Multicenter study conducted to determine the impact on biochemical control and survival of risk-adapted androgen deprivation (AD) combined with high-dose three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) for prostate cancer. Results of biochemical control are reported.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between October 1999 and October 2001, 416 eligible patients with prostate cancer were assigned to one of three treatment groups according to their risk factors: 181 low-risk patients were treated with 3DCRT alone; 75 intermediate-risk patients were allocated to receive neoadjuvant AD (NAD) 4-6 months before and during 3DCRT; and 160 high-risk patients received NAD and adjuvant AD (AAD) 2 years after 3DCRT. Stratification was performed for treatment/risk group and total radiation dose.
RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 36 months (range, 18 to 63 months), the actuarial biochemical disease-free survival (bDFS) at 5 years for all patients was 74%. The corresponding figures for low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk disease were 80%, 73%, and 79%, respectively (P = .847). Univariate analysis showed that higher radiation dose was the only significant factor associated with bDFS for all patients (P = .0004). When stratified for treatment group, this benefit was evident for low-risk patients (P = .009) and, more interestingly, for high-risk patients treated with AAD. The 5-year bDFS for high-risk patients treated with AAD was 63% for radiation doses less than 72 Gy and 84% for those > or = 72 Gy (P = .003).

METHODS AND RESULTS: OSICAT was a randomised, multicentre, open-label French study in 937 patients hospitalised for acute HF ≤12 months before inclusion. Patients were randomised to telemonitoring (daily body weight measurement, daily recording of HF symptoms, and personalised education) (n = 482) or to SC (n = 455). Mean ± standard deviation number of events for the primary outcome was 1.30 ± 1.85 for telemonitoring and 1.46 ± 1.98 for SC [rate ratio 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77-1.23; P = 0.80]. In New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV HF, median time to all-cause death or first unplanned hospitalisation was 82 days in the telemonitoring group and 67 days in the SC group (P = 0.03). After adjustment for known predictive factors, telemonitoring was associated with a 21% relative risk reduction in first unplanned hospitalisation for HF [hazard ratio (HR) 0.79, 95% CI 0.62-0.99; P = 0.044); the relative risk reduction was 29% in patients with NYHA class III or IV HF (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.53-0.95; P = 0.02), 38% in socially isolated patients (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.39-0.98; P = 0.043), and 37% in patients who were ≥70% adherent to body weight measurement (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.45-0.88; P = 0.006).

Aberrant N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor signaling has been suspected in TS mice, due to an impaired generation of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). Memantine, an uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist approved for the treatment of moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease, is known to normalize LTP and improve cognition in transgenic mice with high brain levels of AbetaPP and amyloid-beta protein. It has recently been demonstrated that acute injections of memantine rescue performance deficits of TS mice on a fear conditioning test. Here we show that oral treatment of aged TS mice with a clinically relevant dose of memantine (30 mg/kg/day for 9 weeks) improved spatial learning in the water maze task and slightly reduced brain AbetaPP levels. We also found that TS mice exhibited a significantly reduced granule cell count and vesicular glutamate transporter-1 (VGLUT1) labeling compared to disomic control mice. After memantine treatment, the levels of hippocampal VGLUT1 were significantly increased, reaching the levels observed in vehicle treated-control animals. Memantine did not significantly affect granule cell density.

We investigated the effects of a new magnetically levitated centrifugal continuous-flow pump that was engineered to avert thrombosis.
METHODS: We randomly assigned patients with advanced heart failure to receive either the new centrifugal continuous-flow pump or a commercially available axial continuous-flow pump. Patients could be enrolled irrespective of the intended goal of pump support (bridge to transplantation or destination therapy). The primary end point was a composite of survival free of disabling stroke (with disabling stroke indicated by a modified Rankin score >3; scores range from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating more severe disability) or survival free of reoperation to replace or remove the device at 6 months after implantation. The trial was powered for noninferiority testing of the primary end point (noninferiority margin, -10 percentage points).
RESULTS: Of 294 patients, 152 were assigned to the centrifugal-flow pump group and 142 to the axial-flow pump group. In the intention-to-treat population, the primary end point occurred in 131 patients (86.2%) in the centrifugal-flow pump group and in 109 (76.8%) in the axial-flow pump group (absolute difference, 9.4 percentage points; 95% lower confidence boundary, -2.1 [P<0.001 for noninferiority]; hazard ratio, 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.32 to 0.95 [two-tailed P=0.04 for superiority]). There were no significant between-group differences in the rates of death or disabling stroke, but reoperation for pump malfunction was less frequent in the centrifugal-flow pump group than in the axial-flow pump group (1 [0.7%] vs. 11 [7.7%]; hazard ratio, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.60; P=0.002). Suspected or confirmed pump thrombosis occurred in no patients in the centrifugal-flow pump group and in 14 patients (10.1%) in the axial-flow pump group.
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with advanced heart failure, implantation of a fully magnetically levitated centrifugal-flow pump was associated with better outcomes at 6 months than was implantation of an axial-flow pump, primarily because of the lower rate of reoperation for pump malfunction.

METHODS: An item bank of 68 questions was administered to a nationally representative sample of 971 women using the web, aged 18-45, who experienced regular menstrual cycles in the past 3 months, were not currently pregnant or breastfeeding, and were not being treated or taking medications for depression-related disorders in the last 2 years. Item reduction was performed using forward stepwise linear regression of an overall symptom severity score onto item scores. Three standards were used to validate the instrument: (1) the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists retrospective diagnostic criteria for identifying participants ""at risk"" for clinically significant premenstrual syndrome (PMS), (2) the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders retrospective diagnostic criteria for identifying participants at risk for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), and (3) the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF-12) Health Survey.
RESULTS: Six items met entry criteria in the model.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 62 HF patients (18 ischemic, 44 idiopathic) and 40 healthy control subjects (HC) during the 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 influenza seasons. Antibody titers were measured before and 2-4 weeks and 11-12 months after vaccination. Serum antibody production was measured by hemagglutination inhibition assay, and antibody titers to individual vaccine viral strains between the HF and HC groups were compared after the influenza season to measure persistence of antibody response. All participants demonstrated early antibody seroprotection (titers 40 hemmaglutination inhibition units to 1 strain). Although antibody titers waned over time in both groups, titers to A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 strains decreased more in HF than in HC participants (P = .004 and P = .04, respectively). Titers to the B-type strain decreased to below seroprotective levels in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Antibody titers to influenza A vaccine strains wane to below seroprotective levels in HF patients compared with HC, despite similar rates of initial seroprotection and seroconversion.

Specific patient ""contextual factors,"" if overlooked, result in an inappropriate plan of care, a medical error termed a ""contextual error."" The myriad contextual factors that constitute patient context have been grouped into broad domains to create a taxonomy of challenges to consider when planning care. This study sought to validate a previously identified list of contextual domains.
METHOD: This qualitative study used directed content analysis. In 2014, 19 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) providers (84% female) and 49 patients (86% male) from two VA medical centers and four outpatient clinics in the Chicago area participated in semistructured interviews and focus groups. Topics included patient-specific, community, and resource-related factors that affect patients' abilities to manage their care. Transcripts were analyzed with a previously identified list of contextual domains as a framework.
RESULTS: Analysis of responses revealed that patients and providers identified the same 10 domains previously published, plus 3 additional ones. Based on comments made by patients and providers, the authors created a revised list of 12 domains from themes that emerged. Six pertain to patient circumstances such as access to care and financial situation, and 6 to patient characteristics/states including skills, abilities, and knowledge.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The trial included D+ newborns born at 32 weeks of gestational age or later with a positive direct antiglobulin test and whose mothers were Rh-alloimmunized and did or did not receive intrauterine transfusion. The newborns were randomly assigned to receive either IVIG at a dose of 500 mg/kg or placebo (saline solution, 10 mL/kg) during the first 6 hours of life. The primary outcome was the need for exchange transfusion. The criteria for exchange transfusion were total serum bilirubin (TSB) level at or above 340 µmol/L (20 mg/dL) or increasing by 8.5 µmol/L/hr (0.5 mg/dL/hr) despite intensive phototherapy.
RESULTS: The trial included 92 newborns.

Androgens may affect prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, thereby influencing biopsy recommendations. Also, androgens may stimulate prostate growth at very low levels with no additional effects at higher levels (saturation model).
OBJECTIVE: To test whether androgens were associated with PCa risk in the placebo arm of a prospective study in which biopsies were performed regardless of PSA level.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Of 8122 men in the Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) trial, 4073 men (50.1%) received placebo. Key entry criteria were PSA 2.5-10 ng/ml and one prior negative biopsy.
INTERVENTION: Per-protocol biopsies at 2 and 4 yr; for-cause biopsies at physician discretion.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Multivariable logistic regression was used to test the association between baseline log-transformed testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels and the risk of detecting either PCa or low-grade PCa (Gleason score <6) compared with high-grade PCa (Gleason score >7). In secondary analysis, we stratified the analysis by low baseline androgen levels (testosterone <10 nmol/l; DHT <0.76 nmol/l) compared with normal baseline androgen levels.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Of 4073 men, 3255 (79.9%) had at least one biopsy after randomization and were analyzed. Androgen levels tested continuously or by quintiles were generally unrelated to PCa detection or grade. PCa detection was similar among men with low compared with normal baseline testosterone levels (25.5% and 25.1%; p=0.831). In secondary analysis, higher testosterone levels at baseline were associated with higher PCa detection (odds ratio: 1.23; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.43; p=0.006) only if men had low baseline testosterone (<10nmol/l). For men with normal baseline testosterone (≥10 nmol/l), higher testosterone levels at baseline were unrelated to PCa risk (p=0.33). No association was found for DHT and PCa (all p>0.85).
CONCLUSIONS: Baseline serum testosterone and DHT levels were unrelated to PCa detection or grade. Our findings of the lowest testosterone levels being associated with the lowest PCa risk with no further changes with higher testosterone support a saturation model but must be confirmed in future studies using an a priori defined hypothesis.

METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, comparative study of 3-dose regimens of 3AV (10 μg) and 1AV (20 µg) in adults aged 18-45 years. We evaluated immunogenicity based on hepatitis B surface (HBs) antibody titers at days 1, 28, 90, 180, and 210, adverse and serious adverse events (SAEs) to study day 210. The primary outcome was based on the difference in rates of seroconversion at day 210 (lower bound 95% confidence interval [CI]: > - 4%). Secondary outcomes were seroprotection rates (SPR), defined as anti-HBs ≥10 mIU/mL and anti-HBs geometric mean concentration (GMC).
RESULTS: Rate of seroconversion in 3AV (100%) was noninferior to 1AV (97.9%) at study day 210 (difference: 2.1%, 95% CI: -2.0, 6.3%]) but significantly higher at study day 28.

The mechanism for pain associated with intravenous administration of propofol is believed to be related to the release of nitric oxide. We hypothesized that pain following propofol injection would be reduced by pretreatment with dexamethasone. Methods. One hundred fourteen female subjects received 5 mL of preservative-free saline, 0.5 mg · kg(-1) of lignocaine hydrochloride 10 mg · mL(-1) or 0.25 mg · kg(-1) of dexamethasone, intravenously, following exsanguination and occlusion of the veins of the arm. This was followed by a 0.5 mg · kg(-1) injection of propofol. Pain scores, facial grimacing, arm withdrawal, and vocalization were recorded prior to and at 15 and 30 seconds following the injection of propofol. Results. The incidence of moderate to severe pain following the injection of propofol was significantly decreased with both lidocaine and dexamethasone. Hand withdrawal was also significantly decreased in comparison to saline. Conclusion. Low dose dexamethasone is commonly used as an antiemetic, and, in larger doses, it has been demonstrated to provide prolonged postoperative analgesia.

Girls completed the Maternal Bonding, Mother-Adolescent Communication, and Maternal Monitoring scales while maternalfigures completed the parent versions of the Mother-Adolescent Communication and Monitoring Scales. The findings revealed that maternal monitoring, as perceived by girls and mothers, is related to increased communication between mothers and daughters. Greater church attendance was related to greater perceived maternal bonding for girls. We recommend that nurses use strategies to enhance communication between girls and their maternalfigures and to increase maternal monitoring of daughters' behavior to reduce health risk behaviors among African-American girls.",0,PRIMARY,"Any Sex no Condom, Past 3 Months","Any sex no condom, past 3 months",Risky Sex Prevention,Healthy Behaviors,"Education, activities, empowerment, racial pride building...","General health education, activities",BEHAVIORAL,BEHAVIORAL,EXPERIMENTAL,ACTIVE_COMPARATOR,['0.15'],['logistic GEE'],['Superiority'],2016-Jul-N/A

Even though antioxidant activities of many fruits have been reported, the effects of phytochemicals of goji berry (GB) in patients with metabolic syndrome have not been investigated. In this study, we examined anthropometric and biochemical parameters in patients with metabolic syndrome after the consumption of GB. The patients were divided into two groups, control (C) and supplemented (S), and followed up for 45 days. Participants were individually instructed to carry out a healthy diet, but additionally, an inclusion of 14 g of the natural form of goji berry in the diet during 45 days for the S group was proposed. After 45 days of study, a significant reduction in transaminases as well as an improvement in lipid profile in the S group was observed.

A total of 66 tobacco cessation intervention studies - targeted or population - are reviewed. In addition, an exhaustive review is completed of adolescent self-initiated tobacco use cessation, involving 17 prospective survey studies.Average reach and retention across the intervention studies was 61% and 78%, respectively, and was higher when whole natural units were treated (e.g., classrooms), than when units created specifically for the program were treated (e.g., school-based clinics). The mean quit-rate at a three to 12-month average follow-up among the program conditions was 12%, compared to approximately 7% across control groups. A comparison of intervention theories revealed that motivation enhancement (19%) and contingency-based reinforcement (16%) programs showed higher quit-rates than the overall intervention cessation mean. Regarding modalities (channels) of change, classroom-based programs showed the highest quit rates (17%). Computer-based (expert system) programs also showed promise (13% quit-rate), as did school-based clinics (12%).There was a fair amount of missing data and wide variation on how data points were measured in the programs' evaluations. Also, there were relatively few direct comparisons of program and control groups. Thus, it would be difficult to conduct a formal meta-analysis on the cessation programs. Still, these data suggest that use of adolescent tobacco use cessation interventions double quit rates on the average.In the 17 self-initiated quitting survey studies, key predictors of quitting were living in a social milieu that is composed of fewer smokers, less pharmacological or psychological dependence on smoking, anti-tobacco beliefs (e.g., that society should step in to place controls on smoking) and feeling relatively hopeful about life. Key variables relevant to the quitting process may include structuring the context of programming for youth, motivating quit attempts and reducing ambivalence about quitting, and making programming enjoyable as possible. There also is a need to help youth to sustain a quit-attempt. In this regard, one could provide ongoing support during the acute withdrawal period and teach youth social/life skills. Since there is little information currently available on use of nicotine replacement in young people, continued research in this arena might also be a useful focus for future work.",2,PRIMARY,Point-prevalent Abstinence at 4 Months,"To test our hypothesis that among the subset of the 701 enrolled participants who quit smoking and then lapsed while using the nicotine patch, those randomized to continue the patch post-lapse will be more likely to be 7-day point-prevalent abstinent at 4 month follow-up than those randomized to discontinue the patch post-lapse. 7-day point prevalent abstinence was assessed by response to the question ""In the last 7 days, on how many days did you smoke"" on the 4 month follow-up survey.

Laropiprant (LRPT), a PGD(2) receptor (DP1) antagonist that mitigates niacin-induced flushing, has been combined with extended-release niacin (ERN) into a fixed-dose tablet containing 1g of ERN and 20mg of LRPT (ERN/LRPT 1g). In a large-scale (n=∼1600), multinational, 6-month study in dyslipidemic patients, ERN/LRPT 2g produced superior lipid-modifying efficacy vs placebo, whether administered alone or with concomitant statins.
OBJECTIVE: This Phase III, randomized, double-blind study evaluated the lipid-modifying efficacy of ERN/LRPT alone or added to ongoing statins in Asian patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed hyperlipidemia.
METHODS: After a 4-week placebo run-in, patients were randomized to ERN/LRPT 1g (n=322) or placebo (PBO; n=324). After 4 weeks, the dose was advanced to 2 tablets/d (ERN/LRPT 2g or PBO) for 8 additional weeks. End points included effects of ERN/LRPT 2g vs PBO on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C; primary), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglyceride (TG), and other lipids/lipoproteins.
RESULTS: Relative to PBO, ERN/LRPT 2g produced significant (P < .001) changes in LDL-C (-14.7%), HDL-C (15.9%), TG (-23.4%), LDL-C:HDL-C (-25.5%), non-HDL-C (-16.4%), apolipoprotein (Apo) B (-15.4%), and Apo A-I (5.3%) from baseline to week 12 in the total population.

We developed a patient-family agenda setting intervention to engage family in cancer care communication.
METHODS: We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial (NCT03283553) of patients on active treatment for breast cancer and their family ""care partner."" Intervention dyads (n = 69) completed a self-administered checklist to clarify care partner roles, establish a shared visit agenda, and facilitate MyChart patient portal access. Control dyads (n = 63) received usual care. We assessed intervention acceptability and initial effects from post-visit surveys and MyChart utilization at 6 weeks.
RESULTS: At baseline, most patients (89.4%) but few care partners (1.5%) were registered for MyChart. Most patients (79.4%) wanted their care partner to have access to their records and 39.4% of care partners reported accessing MyChart. In completing the checklist, patients and care partners endorsed active communication roles for the care partner and identified a similar visit agenda: most (> 90%) reported the checklist was easy, useful, and recommended it to others.

This study investigated whether cigarette demand predicted response to contingent monetary rewards for abstinence among individuals with substance use disorders. It also sought to replicate evidence for greater price sensitivity at whole-dollar pack price transitions (ie, left-digit effects).
METHODS: Participants (N = 338) were individuals in residential substance use disorder treatment who participated in a randomized controlled trial that compared contingent vouchers to noncontingent vouchers for smoking abstinence. Baseline demand indices were used to predict number of abstinent days during the 14-day voucher period (after the reduction lead-in) and at 1 and 3 months afterward.
RESULTS: Demand indices correlated with measures of smoking and nicotine dependence. As measured by elasticity, intensity and O max, higher demand significantly predicted fewer abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings during voucher period for individuals in the noncontingent vouchers condition. Breakpoint exhibited a trend-level association with abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings. Demand indices did not predict abstinence in the contingent vouchers group, and did not predict abstinence at 1- and 3-month follow-ups. Left-digit price transitions were associated with significantly greater reductions in consumption.
CONCLUSIONS: The association of cigarette demand with smoking behavior only in the group for whom abstinence was not incentivized indicates that CPT assesses the value of smoking more than the value of money per se and that vouchers counteract the effects of the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes. Results provide initial short-term evidence of predictive validity for the CPT indices.
IMPLICATIONS: This study provides the first evidence of the validity of the CPT for predicting early response to brief advice for smoking cessation plus nicotine replacement in smokers with substance dependence. However, demand for cigarettes did not predict voucher-based treatment response, indicating that incentives serve as a powerful motivator not to smoke that acts in opposition to the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes and that the indices reflect the value of smoking more than the value of money per se.",0,PRIMARY,Number of Participants With Relapse to Any Drug Use,No Description Available,Contingency Management (CM),Noncontingent Reinforcement (NR),"Condition provides contingent monetary reinforcement for smoking reductions (first 5 days) then for smoking abstinence (subsequent 14 days).

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the administration of adjuvant metformin (vs placebo) to patients with breast cancer without diabetes improves outcomes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: MA.32, a phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, conducted in Canada, Switzerland, US, and UK, enrolled 3649 patients with high-risk nonmetastatic breast cancer receiving standard therapy between August 2010 and March 2013, with follow-up to October 2020.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized (stratified for hormone receptor [estrogen receptor and/or progesterone receptor {ER/PgR}] status, positive vs negative; body mass index, ≤30 vs >30; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [ERBB2, formerly HER2 or HER2/neu], positive vs negative; and any vs no chemotherapy) to 850 mg of oral metformin twice a day (n = 1824) or oral placebo twice a day (n = 1825) for 5 years.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was invasive disease-free survival in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Of the 8 secondary outcomes, overall survival, distant relapse-free survival, and breast cancer-free interval were analyzed.
RESULTS: Of the 3649 randomized patients (mean age, 52.4 years; 3643 women [99.8%]), all (100%) were included in analyses. After a second interim analysis, futility was declared for patients who were ER/PgR-, so the primary analysis was conducted for 2533 patients who were ER/PgR+. The median duration of follow-up in the ER/PgR+ group was 96.2 months (range, 0.2-121 months). Invasive disease-free survival events occurred in 465 patients who were ER/PgR+. The incidence rates for invasive disease-free survival events were 2.78 per 100 patient-years in the metformin group vs 2.74 per 100 patient-years in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.01; 95% CI, 0.84-1.21; P = .93), and the incidence rates for death were 1.46 per 100 patient-years in the metformin group vs 1.32 per 100 patient-years in the placebo group (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.86-1.41; P = .47). Among patients who were ER/PgR-, followed up for a median of 94.1 months, incidence of invasive disease-free survival events was 3.58 vs 3.60 per 100 patient-years, respectively (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.79-1.30; P = .92). None of the 3 secondary outcomes analyzed in the ER/PgR+ group had statistically significant differences. Grade 3 nonhematological toxic events occurred more frequently in patients taking metformin than in patients taking placebo (21.5% vs 17.5%, respectively, P = .003). The most common grade 3 or higher adverse events in the metformin vs placebo groups were hypertension (2.4% vs 1.9%), irregular menses (1.5% vs 1.4%), and diarrhea (1.9% vs 7.0%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with high-risk operable breast cancer without diabetes, the addition of metformin vs placebo to standard breast cancer treatment did not significantly improve invasive disease-free survival.

BACKGROUND: Many CLI patients are not candidates for current revascularization procedures, and amputation rates are high in these patients. Cell therapy may be a viable option for CLI patients.
METHODS: Safety was the primary objective and was evaluated by occurrence of adverse events. Efficacy, the secondary objective, was evaluated by assessment of Rutherford category, ankle-brachial index (ABI), transcutaneous partial pressure of oxygen (TcPO(2)), quality of life, and pain.
RESULTS: ALDH(br) cells and ABMMNCs were successfully administered to all patients. No therapy-related serious adverse events occurred.

METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of alfuzosin, an alpha-adrenergic receptor blocker, in reducing symptoms in men with chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome. Participation in the study required diagnosis of the condition within the preceding 2 years and no previous treatment with an alpha-adrenergic receptor blocker. Men were randomly assigned to treatment for 12 weeks with either 10 mg of alfuzosin per day or placebo. The primary outcome was a reduction of at least 4 points (from baseline to 12 weeks) in the score on the National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) (range, 0 to 43; higher scores indicate more severe symptoms). A 4-point decrease is the minimal clinically significant difference in the score.
RESULTS: A total of 272 eligible participants underwent randomization, and in both study groups, 49.3% of participants had a decrease of at least 4 points in their total NIH-CPSI score (rate difference associated with alfuzosin, 0.1%; 95% confidence interval, -11.2 to 11.0; P=0.99). In addition, a global response assessment showed similar response rates at 12 weeks: 33.6% in the placebo group and 34.8% in the alfuzosin group (P=0.90).

METHODS: This randomized, controlled, parallel-group, open-label, 48-week trial compared the stepwise addition of insulin aspart to either the largest meal (titration based on premeal glucose values [SimpleSTEP]) or to the meal with the largest prandial glucose increment (titration based on postmeal glucose values [ExtraSTEP]) in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on basal insulin and oral antidiabetes drugs. After 12 weeks of basal insulin detemir dosage optimization, participants with a hemoglobin A1c level of 7% or greater entered three 12-week treatment periods with stepwise addition of a first insulin aspart bolus, then a second, and then a third, if hemoglobin A1c remained at 7% or greater after 12 and 24 weeks of treatment, respectively. Endpoints included hemoglobin A1c (primary endpoint), fasting plasma glucose, self-measured plasma glucose, adverse events, and hypoglycemia.
RESULTS: Two hundred ninety-six patients were randomly assigned to treatment with insulin aspart in the SimpleSTEP (n = 150) and ExtraSTEP (n = 146) groups.

METHODS: We conducted a phase 3, open-label, multicenter, noninferiority trial that included 1271 patients between 3 and 60 years of age from Asia (81.3%) or Africa (18.7%) with microscopically confirmed, uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. Patients underwent randomization for treatment with a fixed-dose combination of 180 mg of pyronaridine and 60 mg of artesunate or with 250 mg of mefloquine plus 100 mg of artesunate. Doses were calculated according to body weight and administered once daily for 3 days.
RESULTS: Pyronaridine-artesunate was noninferior to mefloquine plus artesunate for the primary outcome: adequate clinical and parasitologic response in the per-protocol population on day 28, corrected for reinfection with the use of polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) genotyping. For this outcome, efficacy in the group receiving pyronaridine-artesunate was 99.2% (743 of 749 patients; 95% confidence interval [CI], 98.3 to 99.7) and that in the group receiving mefloquine plus artesunate was 97.8% (360 of 368 patients; 95% CI, 95.8 to 99.1), with a treatment difference of 1.4 percentage points (95% CI, 0.0 to 3.5; P=0.05). In the intention-to-treat population, efficacy on day 42 in the group receiving pyronaridine-artesunate was 83.1% (705 of 848 patients; 95% CI, 80.4 to 85.6) and that in the group receiving mefloquine plus artesunate was 83.9% (355 of 423 patients; 95% CI, 80.1 to 87.3). In Cambodia, where there were 211 study patients, the median parasite clearance time was prolonged for both treatments: 64 hours versus 16.0 to 38.9 hours in other countries (P<0.001, on the basis of Kaplan-Meier estimates). Kaplan-Meier estimates of the recrudescence rate in the intention-to-treat population in Cambodia until day 42 were higher with pyronaridine-artesunate than with mefloquine plus artesunate (10.2% [95% CI, 5.4 to 18.6] vs. 0%; P=0.04 as calculated with the log-rank test), but similar for the other countries combined (4.7% [95% CI, 3.3 to 6.7] and 2.8% [95% CI, 1.5 to 5.3], respectively; P=0.24). Elevated levels of aminotransferases were observed in those receiving pyronaridine-artesunate. Two patients receiving mefloquine plus artesunate had seizures.

AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vardenafil vs. placebo in men who had ED and metabolic syndrome.
METHODS: This was a 12-week, double-blind, randomized, multicenter, parallel-group, placebo-controlled prospective study in men with ED and metabolic syndrome (assessed by the International Diabetes Federation criteria). Vardenafil was administered at a starting dose of 10 mg, which could be titrated to 5 mg or 20 mg after 4 weeks, depending on efficacy and tolerability.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary efficacy measures were the erectile function domain of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-EF) and Sexual Encounter Profile (SEP) diary questions 2/3. Secondary efficacy measures included SEP1, a diary question assessing ejaculation, the percentage of men achieving ""return-to-normal"" erectile function, and the percentage of men who titrated to a different dose. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded throughout the study.
RESULTS: The intent-to-treat population included 145 men (vardenafil, N = 75; placebo, N = 70). Baseline least squares IIEF-EF domain scores were low (vardenafil: 12.0; placebo: 12.7), indicative of moderate-to-severe ED. Vardenafil was statistically significantly superior to placebo for all primary efficacy measures (P < 0.0001) and showed nominally statistically significant superiority compared with placebo for SEP1/ejaculation success rates (P = 0.0003 and P < 0.0001, respectively) and the percentage of subjects reporting ""return-to-normal"" erectile function (P = 0.0004). Treatment-emergent AEs were mild-to-moderate in severity and consistent with the known AE profile of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to assess the efficacy and safety of vardenafil, taken alone, for ED therapy in a population of men who all had metabolic syndrome.

OBJECTIVE: To determine if administration of BMCs through transendocardial injections improves myocardial perfusion, reduces left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV), or enhances maximal oxygen consumption in patients with coronary artery disease or LV dysfunction, and limiting heart failure or angina.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A phase 2 randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of symptomatic patients (New York Heart Association classification II-III or Canadian Cardiovascular Society classification II-IV) with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 45% or less, a perfusion defect by single-photon emission tomography (SPECT), and coronary artery disease not amenable to revascularization who were receiving maximal medical therapy at 5 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-sponsored Cardiovascular Cell Therapy Research Network (CCTRN) sites between April 29, 2009, and April 18, 2011.
INTERVENTION: Bone marrow aspiration (isolation of BMCs using a standardized automated system performed locally) and transendocardial injection of 100 million BMCs or placebo (ratio of 2 for BMC group to 1 for placebo group).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Co-primary end points assessed at 6 months: changes in LVESV assessed by echocardiography, maximal oxygen consumption, and reversibility on SPECT. Phenotypic and functional analyses of the cell product were performed by the CCTRN biorepository core laboratory.
RESULTS: Of 153 patients who provided consent, a total of 92 (82 men; average age: 63 years) were randomized (n = 61 in BMC group and n = 31 in placebo group). Changes in LVESV index (-0.9 mL/m(2) [95% CI, -6.1 to 4.3]; P = .73), maximal oxygen consumption (1.0 [95% CI, -0.42 to 2.34]; P = .17), and reversible defect (-1.2 [95% CI, -12.50 to 10.12]; P = .84) were not statistically significant. There were no differences found in any of the secondary outcomes, including percent myocardial defect, total defect size, fixed defect size, regional wall motion, and clinical improvement.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Chemotherapy-naïve patients with liver metastases plus or minus limited extrahepatic metastases were randomly assigned to receive either modified FOLFOX (mFOLFOX6; control) or mFOLFOX6 plus SIRT (SIRT) plus or minus bevacizumab. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) at any site as assessed by independent centralized radiology review blinded to study arm.
RESULTS: Between October 2006 and April 2013, 530 patients were randomly assigned to treatment (control, 263; SIRT, 267). Median PFS at any site was 10.2 v 10.7 months in control versus SIRT (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.12; P = .43). Median PFS in the liver by competing risk analysis was 12.6 v 20.5 months in control versus SIRT (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.90; P = .002). Objective response rates (ORRs) at any site were similar (68.1% v 76.4% in control v SIRT; P = .113).

This study investigated whether cigarette demand predicted response to contingent monetary rewards for abstinence among individuals with substance use disorders. It also sought to replicate evidence for greater price sensitivity at whole-dollar pack price transitions (ie, left-digit effects).
METHODS: Participants (N = 338) were individuals in residential substance use disorder treatment who participated in a randomized controlled trial that compared contingent vouchers to noncontingent vouchers for smoking abstinence. Baseline demand indices were used to predict number of abstinent days during the 14-day voucher period (after the reduction lead-in) and at 1 and 3 months afterward.
RESULTS: Demand indices correlated with measures of smoking and nicotine dependence. As measured by elasticity, intensity and O max, higher demand significantly predicted fewer abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings during voucher period for individuals in the noncontingent vouchers condition. Breakpoint exhibited a trend-level association with abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings. Demand indices did not predict abstinence in the contingent vouchers group, and did not predict abstinence at 1- and 3-month follow-ups. Left-digit price transitions were associated with significantly greater reductions in consumption.
CONCLUSIONS: The association of cigarette demand with smoking behavior only in the group for whom abstinence was not incentivized indicates that CPT assesses the value of smoking more than the value of money per se and that vouchers counteract the effects of the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes. Results provide initial short-term evidence of predictive validity for the CPT indices.
IMPLICATIONS: This study provides the first evidence of the validity of the CPT for predicting early response to brief advice for smoking cessation plus nicotine replacement in smokers with substance dependence. However, demand for cigarettes did not predict voucher-based treatment response, indicating that incentives serve as a powerful motivator not to smoke that acts in opposition to the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes and that the indices reflect the value of smoking more than the value of money per se.",0,PRIMARY,Number of Participants Smoking Abstinent in Past 7 Days,7 -day smoking cessation confirmed by expired alveolar CO levels of \< 10 ppm or salivary cotinine \< 16 ng/ml.,Contingency Management (CM),Noncontingent Reinforcement (NR),"Condition provides contingent monetary reinforcement for smoking reductions (first 5 days) then for smoking abstinence (subsequent 14 days).

We aimed to identify the determinants of post-operative pain intensity and post-operative opioid requirement in this context.
METHODS: In this observational prospective study, we recorded patient characteristics, pre-operative pain intensity, anxiety and depression levels, sensitivity and pain thresholds in response to an electrical stimulus, and mu-opioid receptor (OPRM1) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Multivariate linear regression models were used to identify predictors of post-operative pain at rest and opioid requirement.
RESULTS: We included 109 patients. Pre-operative pain at rest (p = 0.047), anxiety level (p = 0.001) and neuropathic pain symptoms (p = 0.030) were independently and positively associated with mean post-operative pain intensity adjusted for mean post-operative morphine equivalent dose (MED).

The purpose of this study was to determine if ultrasound measurement of the depth from skin to epidural space before the epidural technique decreases the failure rate of labor analgesia. A secondary objective was to correlate ultrasound depth to the epidural space with actual depth of the needle at placement.
METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, non-blinded study, 370 parturients requesting labor epidural analgesia were randomized to receive their epidural technique by first year anesthesia residents with or without prior ultrasound determination of epidural space depth. Outcome variables included the incidence of epidural catheter replacement for failed analgesia and the number of epidural attempts and accidental dural punctures.
RESULTS: The ultrasound group had fewer epidural catheter replacements (P<0.02), and epidural placement attempts (P<0.01) compared to the control group. Pearson's correlation coefficients comparing the actual versus ultrasound estimated depth to the epidural space in the longitudinal median and transverse planes were 0.914 and 0.909, respectively.

Evidence suggests that group medical visits are effective for treating chronic pain; similarly, a number of studies demonstrate the effectiveness of certain evidence-based complementary therapies in managing pain.
OBJECTIVES: The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of the integrative medical group visit (IMGV) care model in an inner-city racially diverse outpatient clinic. IMGV combines patient-centered, non-pharmacologic strategies and principles of mindfulness-based stress-reduction with a group medical visit to reduce pain and associated symptoms.
METHODS: We surveyed patients pre and post an 8-session IMGV program to evaluate changes in pain in the last week (0-10 point scale) and comorbid symptoms including depression (Patient Health Questionaire-8 [PHQ-8]), perceived stress, and sleep quality. We also recorded referrals to the program, patients screened for eligibility, total enrollment, loss to follow-up, and attendance.
RESULTS: Seventy patients joined IMGV, and of these, 65 (93%) enrolled in the study. Over the course of 12 months, 7 groups met (median 9 patients/group; range 8-13 participants). Mean difference in pain level for all patients between baseline and 8 weeks was 0.7 (SD=2.0, P=.005).

We hypothesized that live music therapy was more beneficial than recorded music and might improve physiological and behavioral parameters of stable preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit.
METHODS: Thirty-one stable infants randomly received live music, recorded music, and no music therapy over 3 consecutive days. A control of the environment noise level was imposed. Each therapy was delivered for 30 minutes. Inclusion criteria were postconceptional age > or = 32 weeks, weight > or = 1,500 g, hearing confirmed by distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), and no active illness or documentation of hyperresponsiveness to the music. Heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and a behavioral assessment were recorded, every 5 minutes, before, during, and after therapy, allowing 30 minutes for each interval. The infant's state was given a numerical score as follows: 1, deep sleep; 2, light sleep; 3, drowsy; 4, quiet awake or alert; 5, actively awake and aroused; 6, highly aroused, upset, or crying; and 7, prolonged respiratory pause > 8 seconds. The volume range of both music therapies was from 55 to 70 dB. Parents and medical personnel completed a brief questionnaire indicating the effect of the three therapies.
RESULTS: Live music therapy had no significant effect on physiological and behavioral parameters during the 30-minute therapy; however, at the 30-minute interval after the therapy ended, it significantly reduced heart rate (150 +/- 3.3 beats/min before therapy vs 127 +/- 6.5 beats/min after therapy) and improved the behavioral score (3.1 +/- 0.8 before therapy vs 1.3 +/- 0.6 after therapy, p < 0.001). Recorded music and no music therapies had no significant effect on any of the tested parameters during all intervals. Both medical personnel and parents preferred live music therapy to recorded music and no music therapies; however, parents considered live music therapy significantly more effective than the other therapies.

Inhibition of the insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) is a new therapeutic strategy to attenuate the underlying autoimmune pathogenesis of ophthalmopathy.
METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to determine the efficacy and safety of teprotumumab, a human monoclonal antibody inhibitor of IGF-IR, in patients with active, moderate-to-severe ophthalmopathy. A total of 88 patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo or active drug administered intravenously once every 3 weeks for a total of eight infusions. The primary end point was the response in the study eye. This response was defined as a reduction of 2 points or more in the Clinical Activity Score (scores range from 0 to 7, with a score of ≥3 indicating active thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy) and a reduction of 2 mm or more in proptosis at week 24. Secondary end points, measured as continuous variables, included proptosis, the Clinical Activity Score, and results on the Graves' ophthalmopathy-specific quality-of-life questionnaire. Adverse events were assessed.
RESULTS: In the intention-to-treat population, 29 of 42 patients who received teprotumumab (69%), as compared with 9 of 45 patients who received placebo (20%), had a response at week 24 (P<0.001). Therapeutic effects were rapid; at week 6, a total of 18 of 42 patients in the teprotumumab group (43%) and 2 of 45 patients in the placebo group (4%) had a response (P<0.001). Differences between the groups increased at subsequent time points. The only drug-related adverse event was hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes; this event was controlled by adjusting medication for diabetes.

While the typical antipsychotics are of limited value in controlling substance use in schizophrenic patients, previous studies suggest that the novel antipsychotic clozapine (CLOZ) may decrease their substance use. We describe a retrospective study of the effects of the novel antipsychotics risperidone (RISP) and clozapine on alcohol and cannabis use in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and comorbid alcohol and/or cannabis use disorder.
METHOD: This study involved retrospective assessment of abstinence (cessation of alcohol and cannabis use) in 41 patients treated with either risperidone (n=8) or clozapine (n=33) for at least 1 year. In 32 of these 41 patients, information was available on whether abstinence occurred during the 1-year period.
RESULTS: Abstinence rates were significantly higher in patients treated with clozapine than in those treated with risperidone (54% vs. 13%, p=0.05). The nine patients treated for at least 1 year, but excluded from the analysis because time of cessation of use was not known, had all stopped alcohol/cannabis use during clozapine treatment.
DISCUSSION: While the limitations of this retrospective study must be recognized, the data suggest that comorbid patients treated with clozapine are more likely to abstain from alcohol and cannabis use than are those treated with risperidone.

Data from the literature indicate that resveratrol is a compound exerting numerous beneficial effects in organisms. Rodent studies, for example, have demonstrated that resveratrol decreases blood glucose in animals with hyperglycemia. This effect seems to predominantly result from increased intracellular transport of glucose. Resveratrol was also demonstrated to induce effects that may contribute to the protection of β cells in diabetes. In experiments on pancreatic islets, the ability of resveratrol to reduce insulin secretion was demonstrated; this effect was confirmed in animals with hyperinsulinemia, in which resveratrol decreased blood insulin levels. Moreover, inhibition of cytokine action and attenuation of the oxidative damage of the pancreatic tissue by resveratrol were recently shown. Studies of animals with insulin resistance indicate that resveratrol may also improve insulin action. The mechanism through which resveratrol improves insulin action is complex and involves reduced adiposity, changes in gene expression, and changes in the activities of some enzymes. These data indicate that resveratrol may be useful in preventing and treating diabetes.",2,PRIMARY,Diastolic Blood Pressure at Week 12,The diastolic blood pressure was evaluated at baseline and week 12 with a digital sphygmomanometer and the entered values reflect the diastolic blood pressure at week 12,Resveratrol,Placebo,"Resveratrol capsules, 500 mg, three times per day before meals during 90 days

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 467 patients with inadequate glycemic control on insulin (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c] ≥7.5% and ≤11%) were randomized 1:1 to receive sitagliptin 100 mg once daily or a matching placebo for 24 weeks. Randomization was stratified based on metformin use (on or not on metformin) and type of insulin (pre-mixed vs intermediate-/long-acting) at screening. The primary end-point was the change from baseline at week 24 in HbA1c.
RESULTS: The addition of sitagliptin led to a significantly (P < 0.001) greater week 24 HbA1c reduction (0.7%) compared with the reduction (0.3%) with placebo. A significantly (P = 0.013) greater proportion of patients taking sitagliptin (16%) had an HbA1c of <7.0% at week 24 compared with placebo (8%). The addition of sitagliptin significantly (P < 0.001) reduced 2-h post-meal glucose by 26.5 mg/dL (1.5 mmol/L) relative to placebo.

METHODS: Planned secondary analysis of a multi-center, clinical trial randomizing 307 women to 10 weeks of tolterodine alone or combined with behavioral training. Satisfaction was measured using the Patient Satisfaction Question (PSQ). Potential correlates included baseline demographics, incontinence characteristics and prior treatments, history and physical parameters, expectations of treatment success, and outcome variables including the Global Perception of Improvement (GPI) and Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI).
RESULTS: After multivariable analysis, every 10-point increase in UDI change score increased odds of satisfaction by 11% (OR 1.11; 1.04-1.19). Odds of satisfaction increased among women reporting ""much better"" on the GPI (OR 13.8; 4.94-38.60).

METHODS: Pregnant women were administered a modified TWEAK (Tolerance, Worried, Eye-openers, Amnesia, K[C] Cut Down) questionnaire, the 4Ps Plus questionnaire, items from the Addiction Severity Index, and two questions about domestic violence (N=2,684). The sample was divided into ""training"" (n=1,610) and ""validation"" (n=1,074) subsamples. We applied recursive partitioning class analysis to the responses from individuals in the training subsample that resulted in a three-item Substance Use Risk Profile-Pregnancy scale. We examined sensitivity, specificity, and the fit of logistic regression models in the validation subsample to compare the performance of the Substance Use Risk Profile-Pregnancy scale with the modified TWEAK and various scoring algorithms of the 4Ps.
RESULTS: The Substance Use Risk Profile-Pregnancy scale is comprised of three informative questions that can be scored for high- or low-risk populations. The Substance Use Risk Profile-Pregnancy scale algorithm for low-risk populations was mostly highly predictive of substance use in the validation subsample (Akaike's Information Criterion=579.75, Nagelkerke R=0.27) with high sensitivity (91%) and adequate specificity (67%). The high-risk algorithm had lower sensitivity (57%) but higher specificity (88%).
CONCLUSION: The Substance Use Risk Profile-Pregnancy scale is simple and flexible with good sensitivity and specificity. The Substance Use Risk Profile-Pregnancy scale can potentially detect a range of substances that may be abused. Clinicians need to further assess women with a positive screen to identify those who require treatment for alcohol or illicit substance use in pregnancy.

OBJECTIVE: Identify predictors of treatment success and assess the impact of the strongest predictor on outcomes.
METHOD: This is a secondary analysis of a multisite randomized clinical trial of intramuscular electrical stimulation for poststroke shoulder pain. The study included 61 chronic stroke survivors with shoulder pain randomized to a 6-week course of intramuscular electrical stimulation (n = 32) versus a hemisling (n = 29). The primary outcome measure was Brief Pain Inventory Question 12. Treatment success was defined as > or = 2-point reduction in this measure at end of treatment and at 3, 6, and 12 months posttreatment. Forward stepwise regression was used to identify factors predictive of treatment success among participants assigned to the electrical stimulation group. The factor most predictive of treatment success was used as an explanatory variable, and the clinical trials data were reanalyzed.
RESULTS: Time from stroke onset was most predictive of treatment success. Subjects were divided according to the median value of stroke onset: early (<77 weeks) versus late (> 77 weeks). Electrical stimulation was effective in reducing poststroke shoulder pain for the early group (94% vs 7%, P < .001) but not for the late group (31% vs 33%).

Week 12,24105299,"Clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of dapagliflozin, a selective inhibitor of sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2.","Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) is predominantly expressed in the S1 segment of the proximal tubule of the kidney and is the major transporter responsible for mediating renal glucose reabsorption. Dapagliflozin is an orally active, highly selective SGLT2 inhibitor that improves glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by reducing renal glucose reabsorption leading to urinary glucose excretion (glucuresis). Orally administered dapagliflozin is rapidly absorbed generally achieving peak plasma concentrations within 2 h. Dose-proportional systemic exposure to dapagliflozin has been observed over a wide dose range (0.1-500 mg) with an oral bioavailability of 78 %. Dapagliflozin has extensive extravascular distribution (mean volume of distribution of 118 L). Dapagliflozin metabolism occurs predominantly in the liver and kidneys by uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase-1A9 to the major metabolite dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide (this metabolite is not an SGLT2 inhibitor at clinically relevant exposures). Dapagliflozin is not appreciably cleared by renal excretion (<2 % of dose is recovered in urine as parent). Dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide elimination occurs mainly via renal excretion, with 61 % of a dapagliflozin dose being recovered as this metabolite in urine. The half-life for orally administered dapagliflozin 10 mg was 12.9 h. Maximal increases in urinary glucose excretion were seen at doses ≥20 mg/day in patients with T2DM. No clinically relevant differences were observed in dapagliflozin exposure with respect to age, race, sex, body weight, food, or presence of T2DM. Pharmacodynamic changes are dependent on plasma glucose and renal function, and decreases in urinary glucose excretion were observed due to the lower filtered load (plasma glucose × glomerular filtration rate) in healthy volunteers compared to subjects with T2DM. After multiple doses of dapagliflozin, urinary glucose excretion was associated with dose-related decreases in plasma glucose parameters in subjects with T2DM. Patients with severe renal or hepatic impairment show higher systemic exposure to dapagliflozin. No clinically relevant drug interactions were observed that would necessitate dose adjustment of dapagliflozin when administered with other antidiabetic or cardiovascular medications, as well as drugs that could potentially influence dapagliflozin metabolism.",2,PRIMARY,Waist Circumference at Week 12.,The waist circumference is going to be evaluated at week 12 with a flexible tape with standardized techniques.,Dapagliflozin,Placebo,"Dapagliflozin capsules, 10 mg, one per day before breakfast during 90 days.

Strategies to reduce perineal trauma and the appropriate repair of any perineal damage sustained are important for avoiding and alleviating pain. Where pain is present, numerous treatments are used in clinical practice, such as local anaesthetics, oral analgesics, therapeutic ultrasound, antiseptics and non-pharmacological applications such as ice packs and baths. This review assesses the evidence for using rectal analgesia for pain relief following perineal trauma.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of analgesic rectal suppositories for pain from perineal trauma following childbirth.
SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (July 2002), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2002), CINAHL (May 2002) and MIDIRS (May 2002).
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing analgesic rectal suppositories with placebo or alternative treatment for the relief of perineal pain.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers assessed trial quality and extracted data independently.
MAIN RESULTS: Three trials involving 249 women met the inclusion criteria. Only two of the trials identified for inclusion in this review had data that could be entered in a meta-analysis, with the third not providing data in a useable format. Women were less likely to experience pain at or close to 24 hours after birth if they received non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) suppositories compared with placebo (relative risk (RR) 0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.10 to 1.38, 2 trials, 150 women). Women in the NSAID suppositories group compared with women in the placebo group required less additional analgesia in the first 24 hours after birth (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.54, 1 trial, 89 women) and this effect was still evident at 48 hours postpartum (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.89, 1 trial, 89 women). No information was available on pain experienced more than 72 hours after birth or other outcomes of importance to women such as the impact on daily activities, resumption of sexual intercourse and the impact on the mother-baby relationship.
REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: NSAID rectal suppositories are associated with less pain up to 24 hours after birth, and less additional analgesia is required. More research is required regarding long-term effects and maternal satisfaction with the treatment.",2,PRIMARY,Pain Level Twenty Four Hours After Delivery,The primary outcome is pain measured at 24-hours after delivery.

Multidisciplinary efforts may improve care for patients with chronic disease. Pharmacist based interventions have effectively improved management of hypertension. We performed a pragmatic, randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the effect of a pharmacist based quality improvement program on 1) outcomes for patients with CKD and 2) adherence to CKD guidelines in the primary care setting.
METHODS: Patients with moderate to severe CKD receiving primary care services at one of thirteen community-based Veterans Affairs outpatient clinics were randomized to a multifactorial intervention that included a phone-based pharmacist intervention, pharmacist-physician collaboration, patient education, and a CKD registry (n = 1070) or usual care (n = 1129). The primary process outcome was measurement of parathyroid hormone (PTH) during the one year study period. The primary clinical outcome was blood pressure (BP) control in subjects with poorly controlled hypertension at baseline.
RESULTS: Among those with poorly controlled baseline BP, there was no difference in the last recorded BP or the percent at goal BP during the study period (42.0% vs. 41.2% in the control arm). Subjects in the intervention arm were more likely to have a PTH measured during the study period (46.9% vs. 16.1% in the control arm, P <0.001) and were on more classes of antihypertensive medications at the end of the study (P = 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: A one-time pharmacist based intervention proved feasible in patients with CKD. While the intervention did not improve BP control, it did improve guideline adherence and increased the number of antihypertensive medications prescribed to subjects with poorly controlled BP. These findings can inform the design of quality improvement programs and future studies which are needed to improve care of patients with CKD.

Peri-implant and/or gingival samples from loosened implants, chronic periodontitis (CP), and normal controls (n = 10 samples in each group) were analyzed using immunohistochemical staining to observe tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 1-alpha (IL-1alpha), IL-6, platelet-derived growth factor A (PDGF-A), and transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha). These cytokines were found in foreign-body giant cells, macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells. TNF-alpha, IL-1alpha, and IL-6 were increased (P < .05; unpaired t test) in peri-implantitis and CP, whereas PDGF-A and TGF-alpha were not. In conclusion, cytokines with a potential to activate osteoclasts were found in both peri-implantitis and CP, but the cytokine profiles differed in that IL-1alpha was the most prevalent cytokine in the former and TNF-alpha was the most common in the latter.

METHOD: This was a randomized, parallel, controlled trial that was yoked to prenatal care and delivered at hospital outpatient clinics. We enrolled 168 substance-using women who had not yet completed an estimated 28 weeks of pregnancy. Obstetrical clinicians provided brief advice, and study nurses administered manualized MET-CBT. The primary outcome was percentage of days in the prior 28 days in which alcohol and/or drugs were used immediately before and 3 months postdelivery.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences across groups in terms of self-reported percentage of days in which drugs or alcohol were used prior to and 3 months postdelivery. Biological measures showed similar results. There was a trend (P=.08) for lower risk of preterm birth among those who received MET-CBT.

DESIGN: The Male Overactive Bladder Treatment in Veterans (MOTIVE) Trial was a two-site randomized, controlled, equivalence trial with 4-week alpha-blocker run-in.
SETTING: Veterans Affairs Medical Center outpatient clinics.
PARTICIPANTS: Volunteer sample of 143 men aged 42 to 88 who continued to have urgency and more than eight voids per day, with or without incontinence, after run-in.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to 8 weeks of behavioral treatment (pelvic floor muscle exercises, urge suppression techniques, delayed voiding) or drug therapy (individually titrated, extended-release oxybutynin, 5-30 mg/d).
MEASUREMENTS: Seven-day bladder diaries and a validated urgency scale were used to calculate changes in 24-hour voiding frequency, nocturia, urgency, and incontinence. Secondary outcomes were global patient ratings and American Urological Association Symptom Index.
RESULTS: Mean voids per day decreased from 11.3 to 9.1 (-18.8%) with behavioral treatment and 11.5 to 9.5 (-16.9%) with drug therapy. Equivalence analysis indicated that posttreatment means were equivalent (P < .01). After treatment, 85% of participants rated themselves as much better or better; more than 90% were completely or somewhat satisfied, with no between-group differences. The behavioral group showed greater reductions in nocturia (mean = -0.70 vs -0.32 episodes/night; P = .05). The drug group showed greater reductions in maximum urgency scores (mean = -0.44 vs -0.12; P = .02). Other between-group differences were nonsignificant.

Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) reduce periodontitis in animals. We aimed to determine whether DHA supplementation with low-dose aspirin would reduce periodontitis in humans. We conducted a double-blind placebo-controlled parallel trial lasting 3 mo. Fifty-five adults with moderate periodontitis were randomized to 2,000 mg of DHA or identical soy/corn oil capsules. All participants received 81 mg of aspirin but received no other treatments. We analyzed the primary outcome of per-pocket change in pocket depth using mixed models among teeth with pocket depth ≥5 mm. Secondary outcomes assessed with generalized estimating equations included gingival index, plaque index, and bleeding on probing. Gingival crevicular fluid samples were analyzed for changes in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and interleukins 6 and 1β (IL-6 and IL-1β). Plasma was analyzed for changes in systemic inflammatory markers, including hsCRP. We confirmed adherence with erythrocyte fatty acid measurement. Forty-six participants completed the trial. While similar at baseline, the proportion of DHA in red blood cell plasma membranes increased from 3.6% ± 0.9% to 6.2% ± 1.6% in the intervention group but did not change among controls. DHA supplementation decreased mean pocket depth (-0.29 ± 0.13; p = .03) and gingival index (-0.26 ± 0.13; p = .04). Plaque index and bleeding on probing did not change.

Consequently, there is considerable interest in identifying immunosuppressive regimens that permit reduced exposure to CNIs while maintaining adequate immunosuppression. Introducing such strategies early after transplantation may mean that the development of CNI-associated nephrotoxicity could be minimized or prevented. Several CNI-sparing regimens have shown at least comparable efficacy with standard-dose CNI regimens. In particular, a regimen of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), corticosteroids, interleukin-2 receptor antagonist induction, and low-dose tacrolimus from the time of transplantation provided superior renal function and a lower acute rejection rate than the same regimen but with low-dose cyclosporine or low-dose sirolimus, or standard-dose cyclosporine, MMF, and corticosteroids. The use of low-dose cyclosporine does not seem to eliminate nephrotoxicity in de novo renal transplant recipients. The early withdrawal of CNIs from MMF-based regimens generally improves renal function but has been associated with an increased risk of acute rejection, in particular when the levels of mycophenolic acid were not adjusted to maintain the same total level of immunosuppression.

This study was conducted to determine whether daily high-dose vitamin K1 supplementation safely reduces bone loss, bone turnover, and fractures.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: This single-center study was designed as a 2-y randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, extended for earlier participants for up to an additional 2 y because of interest in long-term safety and fractures. A total of 440 postmenopausal women with osteopenia were randomized to either 5 mg of vitamin K1 or placebo daily. Primary outcomes were changes in BMD at the lumbar spine and total hip at 2 y. Secondary outcomes included changes in BMD at other sites and other time points, bone turnover markers, height, fractures, adverse effects, and health-related quality of life. This study has a power of 90% to detect 3% differences in BMD between the two groups. The women in this study were vitamin D replete, with a mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 77 nmol/l at baseline. Over 2 y, BMD decreased by -1.28% and -1.22% (p = 0.84) (difference of -0.06%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.67% to 0.54%) at the lumbar spine and -0.69% and -0.88% (p = 0.51) (difference of 0.19%; 95% CI -0.37% to 0.75%) at the total hip in the vitamin K and placebo groups, respectively. There were no significant differences in changes in BMD at any site between the two groups over the 2- to 4-y period. Daily vitamin K1 supplementation increased serum vitamin K1 levels by 10-fold, and decreased the percentage of undercarboxylated osteocalcin and total osteocalcin levels (bone formation marker). However, C-telopeptide levels (bone resorption marker) were not significantly different between the two groups. Fewer women in the vitamin K group had clinical fractures (nine versus 20, p = 0.04) and fewer had cancers (three versus 12, p = 0.02). Vitamin K supplements were well-tolerated over the 4-y period. There were no significant differences in adverse effects or health-related quality of life between the two groups. The study was not powered to examine fractures or cancers, and their numbers were small.
CONCLUSIONS: Daily 5 mg of vitamin K1 supplementation for 2 to 4 y does not protect against age-related decline in BMD, but may protect against fractures and cancers in postmenopausal women with osteopenia. More studies are needed to further examine the effect of vitamin K on fractures and cancers.

Opioids are commonly used to treat cancer-related pain, but carry the risk of severe side effects, limiting their use. Cebranopadol is a first-in-class drug candidate, combining nociceptin/orphanin FQ peptide and opioid peptide receptor agonism. This trial examined the analgesic efficacy of cebranopadol compared with morphine prolonged release (PR) in patients with moderate-to-severe cancer-related pain.
METHODS: This double-blind, parallel-group, multiple-dose trial was designed as noninferiority trial for efficacy of cebranopadol versus morphine PR. Planned with 524 patients, finally 126 patients were treated for up to 7 weeks (low accrual). The primary efficacy endpoint was the average amount of daily rescue medication intake (morphine immediate release) over the last 2 weeks of treatment.
RESULTS: For the primary endpoint, noninferiority of cebranopadol with and superiority over morphine PR were demonstrated (Full Analysis Set: ∆[95%CI] = -7.48 mg [-12.05, -2.92]; Per Protocol Set: ∆[95%CI] = -4.67 mg [-9.25, -0.10]). The vast majority of patients (≥75%, either treatment) had clinically relevant pain reduction, and noninferiority on this secondary endpoint was not shown. Mostly used doses were ≤800 μg cebranopadol or ≤120 mg morphine PR daily. A total of 83.1% of patients on cebranopadol and 82.0% on morphine PR experienced treatment-emergent adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS: Cebranopadol was effective, safe and well tolerated in the dose range tested (200-1,000 μg) in patients suffering from chronic moderate-to-severe cancer-related pain and was superior to morphine PR on the primary endpoint.

An injection of autologous blood might provide the necessary cellular and humoral mediators to induce a healing cascade. The purpose of this study was to evaluate prospectively the results of refractory lateral epicondylitis treated with autologous blood injections.
METHOD: Twenty-eight patients with lateral epicondylitis were injected with 2 mL of autologous blood under the extensor carpi radialis brevis. All patients had failed previous nonsurgical treatments including all or combinations of physical therapy, splinting, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication, and prior steroid injections. Patients kept personal logs and rated their pain (0-10) and categorized themselves according to Nirschl staging (0-7) daily.
RESULTS: The average follow-up period was 9.5 months (range, 6-24 mo). After autologous blood injections the average pain score decreased from 7.8 to 2.3. The average Nirschl stage decreased from 6.5 to 2.0. For the 9 patients receiving more than one blood injection the mean pain score and Nirschl stage before injection were 7.2 and 6.6, respectively. After the second blood injection the pain and Nirschl scores were both 0.9. Two patients received a third blood injection that brought both pain and Nirschl scores to 0.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 189 patients were randomly assigned to oral sorafenib 400 mg twice daily or to subcutaneous IFN-alpha-2a 9 million U three times weekly (period 1). Sorafenib patients who progressed were dose-escalated to 600 mg twice daily; IFN-alpha-2a patients who progressed were switched to sorafenib 400 mg twice daily (period 2).
RESULTS: In period 1 PFS was similar for sorafenib-treated (n = 97; 5.7 months) and IFN-alpha-2a-treated patients (n = 92; 5.6 months); more sorafenib-treated patients had tumor shrinkage (68.2% v 39.0%). Common drug-related AEs (Grades > or = 3) for sorafenib were hand-foot skin reaction (11.3%), diarrhea (6.2%), and rash/desquamation (6.2%); for IFN-alpha-2a, these were fatigue (10.0%), nausea (3.3%), flu-like syndrome (2.2%), and anorexia (2.2%). Sorafenib-treated patients reported fewer symptoms, better quality of life (QOL), and greater treatment satisfaction. In period 2, 41.9% of patients who received sorafenib 600 mg twice daily (n = 43) experienced tumor reduction (median PFS, 3.6 months). After the switch to sorafenib 400 mg twice daily, tumors were reduced in 76.2% of 50 patients (median PFS, 5.3 months). AEs were mostly grade 1 to 2; no increase in AEs of grades > or = 3 occurred after sorafenib dose escalation.
CONCLUSION: In this study, sorafenib resulted in similar PFS as IFN-alpha-2a in patients with untreated RCC.

Treatment with glucocorticoids is the gold-standard and prevents severe vascular complications but is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Tocilizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-6 receptor, has been associated with rapid induction and maintenance of remission in patients with giant cell arteritis. We therefore aimed to study the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in the first randomised clinical trial in patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent giant cell arteritis.
METHODS: In this single centre, phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited patients aged 50 years and older from University Hospital Bern, Switzerland, who met the 1990 American College of Rheumatology criteria for giant cell arteritis. Patients with new-onset or relapsing disease were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either tocilizumab (8 mg/kg) or placebo intravenously. 13 infusions were given in 4 week intervals until week 52. Both groups received oral prednisolone, starting at 1 mg/kg per day and tapered down to 0 mg according to a standard reduction scheme defined in the study protocol. Allocation to treatment groups was done using a central computerised randomisation procedure with a permuted block design and a block size of three, and concealed using central randomisation generated by the clinical trials unit. Patients, investigators, and study personnel were masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who achieved complete remission of disease at a prednisolone dose of 0·1 mg/kg per day at week 12. All analyses were intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01450137.
RESULTS: Between March 3, 2012, and Sept 9, 2014, 20 patients were randomly assigned to receive tocilizumab and prednisolone, and ten patients to receive placebo and glucocorticoid; 16 (80%) and seven (70%) patients, respectively, had new-onset giant cell arteritis. 17 (85%) of 20 patients given tocilizumab and four (40%) of ten patients given placebo reached complete remission by week 12 (risk difference 45%, 95% CI 11-79; p=0·0301). Relapse-free survival was achieved in 17 (85%) patients in the tocilizumab group and two (20%) in the placebo group by week 52 (risk difference 65%, 95% CI 36-94; p=0·0010). The mean survival-time difference to stop glucocorticoids was 12 weeks in favour of tocilizumab (95% CI 7-17; p<0·0001), leading to a cumulative prednisolone dose of 43 mg/kg in the tocilizumab group versus 110 mg/kg in the placebo group (p=0·0005) after 52 weeks. Seven (35%) patients in the tocilizumab group and five (50%) in the placebo group had serious adverse events.

METHODS: We extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.
RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female. The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died. Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife. Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city. The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%). Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%). The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).

METHODS: Data were analyzed for 134 adults 60 years or older with insomnia and apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of less than 15 who were randomized to a larger study of CBTI versus a sleep education control. Sleep outcomes (sleep onset latency, total wake time, wake after sleep onset, sleep efficiency, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) were compared between CBTI and control at 6 months using repeated-measures analysis of variance adjusted for baseline values.

Most data come from subjects receiving cinacalcet after several years of dialysis treatment. We therefore compared the efficacy of treatment with cinacalcet and low doses of active vitamin D to flexible doses of active vitamin D alone for the management of SHPT in patients recently initiating haemodialysis.
METHODS: This open-label trial randomized subjects (n = 309) with parathyroid hormone (PTH) >300 pg/mL on dialysis for 3-12 months to either cinacalcet with low-dose active vitamin D, if prescribed (cinacalcet); or usual care without cinacalcet (control). Randomized subjects were stratified by PTH at screening (300-450, >450-600, >600 pg/mL) and by the use of active vitamin D at enrolment. Treatment duration was 12 months, with primary efficacy endpoint (mean PTH reduction ≥ 30% from baseline) assessed at 6 months.
RESULTS: The mean [standard deviation (SD)] haemodialysis vintage at enrolment was 7.2 (2.7) months; 53% of subjects were not receiving active vitamin D at enrolment. There was a significant difference in the achievement of the primary endpoint (≥ 30% PTH reduction at 6 months) between cinacalcet-treated subjects and controls in both the entire cohort (63 versus 38%; n = 304; P < 0.0001) and the subgroup of subjects not receiving active vitamin D at enrolment (70 versus 44%; n = 161; P < 0.01). Hypocalcaemia and gastrointestinal adverse events were more commonly observed in cinacalcet-treated subjects.

BACKGROUND: Statin therapy significantly reduces the risk for thrombotic events. Whether or not these benefits are attributable to reduction in plaque lipid content remains to be properly documented in human obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD).
METHODS: We randomized 87 patients with multivessel CAD undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention and at least 1 other severely obstructive (fractional flow reserve [FFR] ≤0.8) nontarget lesion (NTL) to intensive (rosuvastatin 40 mg daily) or standard-of-care lipid-lowering therapy. NTLs were evaluated at baseline and after 7 weeks of therapy with FFR, near-infrared spectroscopy, and intravascular ultrasound. The primary endpoint was the change in lipid-core burden index at the 4-mm maximal segment (LCBI4mm max), wherever this occurred within the lesion.
RESULTS: Upon follow-up, median reduction (95% confidence interval) in LCBI4mm max was significantly greater in the intensive versus standard group (-149.1 [-210.9 to -42.9] vs. 2.4 [-36.1 to 44.7]; p = 0.01). Results remained consistent after adjustment for baseline differences in LCBI between groups and use of change in LCBI across the entire lesion as the dependent outcome.

Both experiments confirm that individuals with Down syndrome show poorer verbal short-term memory performance than controls. However, they rule out rehearsal as an explanation of these deficits because the evidence suggests that neither individuals with Down syndrome nor matched controls are engaging in spontaneous subvocal rehearsal.

As part of the overall study design, building on prior randomized control trials that utilized a run-in period prior to the trial, our study team designed an optimization period to test the home visit and study procedures under real-world conditions.
METHODS: For this optimization project, there were 3 process improvement goals: to improve the referral process to the home visit, to optimize the home visit content, and to define and operationalize measures of patient- and family-centered outcomes to be used in the subsequent randomized control trial. During the optimization period, a multidisciplinary study team met weekly to review family and stakeholder feedback about the iterative modifications made to the home visit process, content, and outcome measures.
RESULTS: Optimization home visits were completed with 301 families across a variety of discharge diagnoses. The outcomes planned for the clinical trial were tested and refined. Feedback from families and stakeholders indicated that the content changes made to the home visits resulted in increased family knowledge of warning signs to monitor postdischarge. Thirty-one percent of families reported that they altered the care of their child after the home visit.

DESIGN: Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study.
PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-eight patients completed the study, 35 patients in the placebo group and 33 patients in the CF101 group.
INTERVENTION: Patients were treated orally with either 1 mg CF101 pills or matching vehicle-filled placebo pills, given twice daily for 12 weeks, followed by a 2-week posttreatment observation.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: An improvement of more than 25% over baseline at week 12 in one of the following parameters: (1) tear break-up time (BUT); (2) superficial punctate keratitis assessed by fluorescein staining results; and (3) Schirmer tear test 1 results. Clinical laboratory safety tests, ophthalmic examinations, intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements, electrocardiographic evaluations, vital sign measurements, and monitoring of adverse events.
RESULTS: A statistically significant increase in the proportion of patients who achieved more than 25% improvement in the corneal staining and in the clearance of corneal staining was noted between the CF101-treated group and the placebo group. Treatment with CF101 resulted in a statistically significant improvement in the mean change from baseline at week 12 of the corneal staining, BUT, and tear meniscus (TM) height in the CF101-treated group.

This study was conducted to determine whether daily high-dose vitamin K1 supplementation safely reduces bone loss, bone turnover, and fractures.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: This single-center study was designed as a 2-y randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, extended for earlier participants for up to an additional 2 y because of interest in long-term safety and fractures. A total of 440 postmenopausal women with osteopenia were randomized to either 5 mg of vitamin K1 or placebo daily. Primary outcomes were changes in BMD at the lumbar spine and total hip at 2 y. Secondary outcomes included changes in BMD at other sites and other time points, bone turnover markers, height, fractures, adverse effects, and health-related quality of life. This study has a power of 90% to detect 3% differences in BMD between the two groups. The women in this study were vitamin D replete, with a mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 77 nmol/l at baseline. Over 2 y, BMD decreased by -1.28% and -1.22% (p = 0.84) (difference of -0.06%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.67% to 0.54%) at the lumbar spine and -0.69% and -0.88% (p = 0.51) (difference of 0.19%; 95% CI -0.37% to 0.75%) at the total hip in the vitamin K and placebo groups, respectively. There were no significant differences in changes in BMD at any site between the two groups over the 2- to 4-y period. Daily vitamin K1 supplementation increased serum vitamin K1 levels by 10-fold, and decreased the percentage of undercarboxylated osteocalcin and total osteocalcin levels (bone formation marker). However, C-telopeptide levels (bone resorption marker) were not significantly different between the two groups. Fewer women in the vitamin K group had clinical fractures (nine versus 20, p = 0.04) and fewer had cancers (three versus 12, p = 0.02). Vitamin K supplements were well-tolerated over the 4-y period. There were no significant differences in adverse effects or health-related quality of life between the two groups.

This study sought to establish whether ketamine given peri-operatively could reduce persistent post-surgical pain.
TRIAL DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial comparing low-dose intravenous ketamine and saline placebo.
METHODS: Seventy patients undergoing thoracotomy were randomized to receive either intravenous ketamine (0.1 mg kg
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in post-operative pain, except the ketamine group reported less pain at rest 48 hr after surgery (p = 0.03). The ketamine group requested significantly less morphine via PCA in the first 24 hr (p = 0.03). There were no differences in pain measures or opioid consumption at 6 weeks, 3, 6 or 12 months. Patients in the ketamine group were more lightheaded (p = 0.02) and experienced more vivid dreams (p = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine reduced opioid consumption compared to placebo after surgery, but we were unable to detect any differences in persistent post-surgical pain between the groups.

We compared patient-identified barriers/facilitators to retention in care and antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and evaluated how they mapped to ABM. Qualitative semi-structured interviews with 51 HIV-infected adults at HIV clinics in Philadelphia, PA, in 2013 were used to explore patients' experiences with HIV care and treatment. Interview data were analyzed for themes using a grounded theory approach. Among those interviewed, 53% were male and 88% were nonwhite; 49% were retained in care, 96% were on ART, and 57% were virally suppressed. Patients discussed 18 barriers/facilitators to retention in care and ART adherence: 11 common to both behaviors (stigma, mental illness, substance abuse, social support, reminder strategies, housing, insurance, symptoms, competing life activities, colocation of services, provider factors), 3 distinct to retention (transportation, clinic experiences, appointment scheduling), and 4 distinct to adherence (medication characteristics, pharmacy services, health literacy, health beliefs).

This analysis examined pooled efficacy data as reflected in cumulative pain scores from 10 randomized, double-blind liposome bupivacaine clinical studies in which the study drug was administered via local wound infiltration.
METHODS: A total of 823 patients were exposed to liposome bupivacaine in 10 local wound infiltration studies at doses ranging from 66 mg to 532 mg in five surgical settings; 446 patients received bupivacaine HCl (dose: 75-200 mg) and 190 received placebo. Efficacy measures were assessed through 72 hours after surgery.
RESULTS: Overall, 45% of patients were male and 19% were ≥65 years of age. In the analysis of cumulative pain intensity scores through 72 hours, liposome bupivacaine was associated with lower pain scores than the comparator in 16 of 19 treatment arms assessed, achieving statistically significant differences compared with bupivacaine HCl (P < 0.05) in five of 17 treatment arms. These results were supported by results of other efficacy measures, including time to first use of opioid rescue medication, proportion of patients avoiding opioid rescue medication, total postsurgical consumption of opioid rescue medication, and patient/care provider satisfaction with postoperative analgesia. Local infiltration of liposome bupivacaine resulted in significant systemic plasma levels of bupivacaine, which could persist for 96 hours; systemic plasma levels of bupivacaine following administration of liposome bupivacaine were not correlated with local efficacy.

We examined whether an intensive lifestyle intervention for weight loss would decrease cardiovascular morbidity and mortality among such patients.
METHODS: In 16 study centers in the United States, we randomly assigned 5145 overweight or obese patients with type 2 diabetes to participate in an intensive lifestyle intervention that promoted weight loss through decreased caloric intake and increased physical activity (intervention group) or to receive diabetes support and education (control group). The primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for angina during a maximum follow-up of 13.5 years.
RESULTS: The trial was stopped early on the basis of a futility analysis when the median follow-up was 9.6 years. Weight loss was greater in the intervention group than in the control group throughout the study (8.6% vs. 0.7% at 1 year; 6.0% vs. 3.5% at study end).

Furthermore, knee extension velocity also had increased, but remained lower than that of the control group. The changes in knee extension velocity took place during the first 6 months, after which a plateau was visible. Limitations A potential limitation of the study design was that the patients were not perfectly matched with the control subjects.

An injectable suspension of naltrexone for extended release (XR-NTX) was recently approved by the FDA for treatment of opioid dependence. XR-NTX treatment may require concurrent behavioral intervention to maximize adherence and effectiveness, thus we sought to evaluate employment-based reinforcement as a method of improving adherence to XR-NTX in opiate dependent adults.
METHODS: Opioid-dependent adults (n=38) were detoxified and inducted onto oral naltrexone, then randomly assigned to contingency or prescription conditions. Participants received up to six doses of XR-NTX at four-week intervals. All participants could earn vouchers for attendance and performance at a therapeutic workplace. Contingency participants were required to accept XR-NTX injections to access the workplace and earn vouchers. Prescription participants could earn vouchers independent of their acceptance of XR-NTX injections.
RESULTS: Contingency participants accepted significantly more naltrexone injections than prescription participants (87% versus 52%, p=.002), and were more likely to accept all injections (74% versus 26%, p=.004). Participants in the two conditions provided similar percentages of samples negative for opiates (72% versus 65%) and for cocaine (58% versus 54%). Opiate positivity was significantly more likely when samples were also cocaine positive, independent of naltrexone blockade (p=.002).
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term adherence to XR-NTX in unemployed opiate dependent adults is low under usual care conditions. Employment-based reinforcement can maintain adherence to XR-NTX.

DESIGN: Single-blind (interviewer), parallel, randomized, controlled trial (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01357564).
SETTING: Veteran's homes.
PARTICIPANTS: Veterans with dementia and their family caregivers (N = 160 dyads).
INTERVENTION: Dyads in TAP-VA underwent 8 sessions with occupational therapists to customize activities to the interests and abilities of the veterans and educate their caregivers about dementia and use of customized activity. Caregivers assigned to attention control received up to 8 telephone-based dementia education sessions with a research team member.
MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcomes included number of behaviors and frequency of their occurrence multiplied by severity of occurrence; secondary outcomes were functional dependence, pain, emotional well-being, caregiver burden (time spent caregiving, upset with behaviors) and affect at 4 (primary endpoint) and 8 months.
RESULTS: Of 160 dyads (n = 76 TAP-VA; n = 84 control), 111 completed 4-month interviews (n = 51 TAP-VA; n = 60 control), and 103 completed 8-month interviews (n = 50 TAP-VA; n = 53 control).

TAP-VA provides caregivers with the requisite knowledge and skills to use activities. Caregivers are instructed in specific skills such as ways to simplify activities, the environment and their communication, and how to help the Veteran initiate and follow a sequence. The overall goal is to provide predictability, familiarity, and structure in the daily life of the Veteran and establish a level of environmental stimulation appropriate to that person's abilities.","The ATN Serves 3 purposes: 1) creates clinical equipoise, ensuring that ethical treatment is provided to all study participants; 2) controls for the one-on-one attention to caregivers in the intervention group to rule out potential effects of professional contact; and 3) serves as a retention tool.

Initial studies have yielded promising results, suggesting that a larger randomized clinical trial is warranted.
OBJECTIVE: To compare visual acuity (VA) improvement in children with amblyopia treated with a binocular iPad game vs part-time patching.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A multicenter, noninferiority randomized clinical trial was conducted in community and institutional practices from September 16, 2014, to August 28, 2015. Participants included 385 children aged 5 years to younger than 13 years with amblyopia (20/40 to 20/200, mean 20/63) resulting from strabismus, anisometropia, or both. Participants were randomly assigned to either 16 weeks of a binocular iPad game prescribed for 1 hour a day (190 participants; binocular group) or patching of the fellow eye prescribed for 2 hours a day (195 participants; patching group). Study follow-up visits were scheduled at 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks. A modified intent-to-treat analysis was performed on participants who completed the 16-week trial.
INTERVENTIONS: Binocular iPad game or patching of the fellow eye.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Change in amblyopic-eye VA from baseline to 16 weeks.
RESULTS: Of the 385 participants, 187 were female (48.6%); mean (SD) age was 8.5 (1.9) years. At 16 weeks, mean amblyopic-eye VA improved 1.05 lines (2-sided 95% CI, 0.85-1.24 lines) in the binocular group and 1.35 lines (2-sided 95% CI, 1.17-1.54 lines) in the patching group, with an adjusted treatment group difference of 0.31 lines favoring patching (upper limit of the 1-sided 95% CI, 0.53 lines). This upper limit exceeded the prespecified noninferiority limit of 0.5 lines. Only 39 of the 176 participants (22.2%) randomized to the binocular game and with log file data available performed more than 75% of the prescribed treatment (median, 46%; interquartile range, 20%-72%). In younger participants (aged 5 to <7 years) without prior amblyopia treatment, amblyopic-eye VA improved by a mean (SD) of 2.5 (1.5) lines in the binocular group and 2.8 (0.8) lines in the patching group. Adverse effects (including diplopia) were uncommon and of similar frequency between groups.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In children aged 5 to younger than 13 years, amblyopic-eye VA improved with binocular game play and with patching, particularly in younger children (age 5 to <7 years) without prior amblyopia treatment. Although the primary noninferiority analysis was indeterminate, a post hoc analysis suggested that VA improvement with this particular binocular iPad treatment was not as good as with 2 hours of prescribed daily patching.

Yet surveys reveal physicians-in-training are uncomfortable managing obesity. One major barrier is the lack of residency education on obesity management. This study incorporates an obesity-specific didactic curriculum into an internal medicine (IM) residency programme and assesses its impact on residents' knowledge, attitudes, practice behaviours, and clinical outcomes in patients with obesity.
METHODS: The intervention consisted of four, 1 h, obesity-specific lectures in the University of Florida Resident Noon Conference. Lectures were taught by multidisciplinary experts and offered to 75 IM residents every 2 weeks from 5 November 2010 to 17 December 2010. Impact on IM residents' knowledge and attitudes was assessed by a pre- and post-intervention Obesity Awareness Questionnaire (OAQ). IM residents' clinical performance was assessed by chart reviews of 238 patients with body mass index >25 kg/m(2) in residents' clinics 4 months pre- and 6 months post-intervention for three clinical outcomes and seven practice behaviours on obesity management. Pre- and post-intervention outcomes were compared via paired t tests (quantitative data) or McNemar's test (binary data).
RESULTS: Mean lecture attendance was 25/75 residents (33%) per lecture. Survey response was 67/75 residents (89%) pre-OAQ and 63/75 residents (84%) post-OAQ. While most attitudes remained unchanged, IM residents gained significant confidence in exercise counselling, safety of bariatric surgery, and patients' weight loss potential; they were more likely to address obesity in the plan and referrals to bariatric surgery. Clinical outcomes and IM residents' knowledge demonstrated no improvement.
CONCLUSIONS: Our brief lecture-based curriculum has the potential to improve IM residents' attitudes and practice behaviours towards obesity.

Various studies that have used this task show socially anxious individuals exhibit selective attention for threat faces (Mogg & Bradley, 2002; Mogg, Philippot, & Bradley, 2004b; Pishyar, Harris, & Menzies, 2004). Selective attention for threat when measured with a probe detection task is interpreted as an attentional shift toward threat (""vigilance""). Yet, there is data that show socially anxious individuals may have difficulty in shifting their attention away from threat (""disengagement""; Amir, Elias, Klumpp, & Przeworski, 2003). A step toward clarifying the extent to which selective attention for threat comprises vigilance or disengagement effects is described by Koster, Crombez, Verschuere, and de Houwer (2004). We adapted their modified probe detection task to examine vigilance and disengagement effects for threat and happy faces in individuals with and without social anxiety. The results indicate that socially anxious individuals exhibit vigilance for threat faces, but not for happy faces, compared to individuals without social anxiety.

We report data for the longest efficacy evaluation to date of a prophylactic HPV vaccine. In total, 552 women (16-23 years) were enrolled in a randomised, placebo-controlled study of a quadrivalent HPV 6/11/16/18 L1 virus-like-particle vaccine with vaccination at months 0, 2, and 6. At regular intervals through 3 years, subjects underwent gynaecologic examination, cervicovaginal sampling for HPV DNA, serum anti-HPV testing, and Pap testing, with follow-up biopsy as indicated. A subset of 241 subjects underwent two further years of follow-up. At 5 years post enrollment, the combined incidence of HPV 6/11/16/18-related persistent infection or disease was reduced in vaccine-recipients by 96% (two cases vaccine versus 46 placebo). There were no cases of HPV 6/11/16/18-related precancerous cervical dysplasia or genital warts in vaccine recipients, and six cases in placebo recipients (efficacy = 100%; 95% CI:12-100%).

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: VAC therapy is widely used, but can be expensive and difficult to apply; it also fails in some patients.
METHODS: A randomized prospective study of 87 patients (N = 45 in the GSUC arm and N = 42 in the VAC arm) was undertaken between October 2006 and May 2008. The study comprised patients with acute wounds resulting from trauma, dehiscence, or surgery.
RESULTS: Demographics and wound characteristics were similar in both groups. There were significant reductions in wound surface area and volume in each group. In the GSUC group, the reductions in wound surface area and volume were 4.5%/day and 8.4%/day, respectively (P < 0.001 for both), and in the VAC group, this was 4.9%/day and 9.8%/day, respectively (P < 0.001 for both). The reductions in wound surface area and volume were similar in both groups (P = 0.60 and 0.19, respectively, for the group-by-time interaction). The estimated difference (VAC - GSUC) was 0.4% (95% confidence interval: -1.0, 1.7) for wound surface area and 1.4% (95% confidence interval: -0.7, 3.5) for volume. The mean cost per day for GSUC therapy was $4.22 versus $96.51 for VAC therapy (P < 0.01) and the average time required for a GSUC dressing change was 19 minutes versus 31 minutes for a VAC dressing change (P < 0.01). The sum of pain intensity differences was 0.50 in the GSUC group compared with 1.73 for the VAC group (P = 0.02).

We aimed to examine associations of quantitative gastrointestinal and psychological traits with obesity, and to validate the ability of these traits to predict responses of obese individuals to pharmacotherapy.
METHODS: In a prospective study, we measured gastric emptying of solids and liquids, fasting and postprandial gastric volume, satiation by nutrient drink test (volume to fullness and maximal tolerated volume), satiety after an ad libitum buffet meal, gastrointestinal hormones, and psychological traits in 328 normal-weight, overweight, or obese adults. We also analyzed data from 181 previously studied adults to assess associations betwecen a subset of traits with body mass index and waist circumference. Latent dimensions associated with overweight or obesity were appraised by principal component analyses. We performed a proof of concept, placebo-controlled trial of extended-release phentermine and topiramate in 24 patients to validate associations between quantitative traits and response to weight-loss therapy.
RESULTS: In the prospective study, obesity was associated with fasting gastric volume (P = .03), accelerated gastric emptying (P < .001 for solids and P = .011 for liquids), lower postprandial levels of peptide tyrosine tyrosine (P = .003), and higher postprandial levels of glucagon-like peptide 1 (P < .001). In a combined analysis of data from all studies, obesity was associated with higher volume to fullness (n = 509; P = .038) and satiety with abnormal waist circumference (n = 271; P = .016). Principal component analysis identified latent dimensions that accounted for approximately 81% of the variation among overweight and obese subjects, including satiety or satiation (21%), gastric motility (14%), psychological factors (13%), and gastric sensorimotor factors (11%). The combination of phentermine and topiramate caused significant weight loss, slowed gastric emptying, and decreased calorie intake; weight loss in response to phentermine and topiramate was significantly associated with calorie intake at the prior satiety test.
CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative traits are associated with high body mass index; they can distinguish obesity phenotypes and, in a proof of concept clinical trial, predicted response to pharmacotherapy for obesity.

No large scale U.S. studies have investigated the association between food insecurity and severity of HIV disease or the mechanism of this possible association. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of food insecurity on HIV disease outcomes in a large cohort of HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral medications.
DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional study.
PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Participants were HIV-infected patients enrolled in the Veterans Aging Cohort Study between 2002-2008 who were receiving antiretroviral medications.
MAIN MEASUREMENTS: Participants reporting ""concern about having enough food for you or your family in the past 30 days"" were defined as food insecure. Using multivariable logistic regression, we explored the association between food insecurity and both low CD4 counts (<200 cells/μL) and unsuppressed HIV-1 RNA (>500 copies/mL). We then performed mediation analysis to examine whether antiretroviral adherence or body mass index mediates the observed associations.
KEY RESULTS: Among 2353 HIV-infected participants receiving antiretroviral medications, 24% reported food insecurity. In adjusted analyses, food insecure participants were more likely to have an unsuppressed HIV-1 RNA (AOR 1.37, 95% CI 1.09, 1.73) compared to food secure participants. Mediation analysis revealed that neither antiretroviral medication adherence nor body mass index contributes to the association between food insecurity and unsuppressed HIV-1 RNA. Food insecurity was not independently associated with low CD4 counts.

Their results, however, may not be generalizable to real-world populations. While glucocorticoids (GCs) remain a mainstay of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment, it is unclear whether the results of GC-RCTs are generalizable to current real-world RA patients.
METHODS: MEDLINE was searched for RCTs and, as comparators, cohort studies (CSs) in RA evaluating systemic GCs. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed for descriptive baseline characteristics (including general demographics, comorbidities, and disease activity) that have been shown to be able to modify the benefit-risk-ratio of various RA therapeutics. These meta-analyses were stratified by study type (RCT and CS). Stratified estimates were subsequently compared. Further sensitivity analyses were performed stratifying by disease duration.
RESULTS: 56 RCTs (7053 participants) and 10 CSs (14,688 participants) were included. 12 characteristics were reported frequently enough to allow for comparative analysis. In 10/12 characteristics (83%), RCT estimates did not appear to differ from CS estimates. However, RCT participants were younger (-4.7 years [95% CI -7.2 to -2.1]; p < 0.001) and had higher erythrocyte sedimentation rates (11.8 mm/h [5.7 to 17.8]; p < 0.001) than CS participants. Comorbidities could not be assessed due to insufficient reporting.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that evidence from GC trials in RA is of acceptable generalizability to current real-world patients - especially compared to findings from biologic agents in RA. However, RCT participants were younger than real-world patients, potentially limiting the generalizability of trial results to elderly patients.

METHODS: We conducted a randomized double-blinded study in a tertiary academic center including 30 patients with a Parsonnet score>or=15 scheduled for a high-risk cardiac surgery. The patients were randomized to receive either IV NTG (initial dose of 0.05 microg.kg(-1).min(-1), followed by 0.1 microg.kg(-1).min(-1)) or placebo after anesthetic induction until the end of CPB. The primary outcome was a decrease of 10% in NIRS values during CPB.
RESULTS: Despite the absence of between-group difference in the mean cerebral oxygen saturation during CPB, there was a significant decrease in NIRS values during CPB in the placebo group, whereas mean NIRS values were maintained in the IV NTG group (-16.7% vs 2.3% in the NTG, P=0.019). Major hemodynamic variables were similar at corresponding time periods in both groups, while patients in the IV NTG group had higher CK-MB values and experienced greater blood loss during the first 24 hr postoperatively.

Angiotensin II receptor blockade by systemic administration of the AT(1) receptor antagonists has been proposed as a new treatment possibility for anxiety disorders. For better understanding of the related mechanisms, in this study we evaluated effects of bilateral intraamygdaloid injections of 2 (LOS 2) and 4 (LOS 4) μg of losartan (LOS), a selective AT(1) receptor antagonist, on the behavior of the not stressed and acutely stressed rats in an elevated ""plus"" maze. Under non-stress conditions, LOS 4 increased time spent in the open arms (p < 0.01), number of extreme open arm arrivals (p < 0.05), time per entry (p < 0.01), and the number of total arm entries (p < 0.05) showing thus considerable anxiolytic activity. The open arm extreme arrivals were increased by LOS 4 in both not stressed (p < 0.05) and stressed (p < 0.05) rats. When no stressed and stressed LOS 4 animals were compared, time per entry and the number of closed arm entries (p < 0.05, both) were decreased in the latter group. Moreover, the LOS 4 stressed rats had significantly increased open/closed arm quotient (p < 0.05) as compared to the both control and LOS 4 non-stress group (p < 0.05, both).

METHODS: We randomly assigned 9361 persons with a systolic blood pressure of 130 mm Hg or higher and an increased cardiovascular risk, but without diabetes, to a systolic blood-pressure target of less than 120 mm Hg (intensive treatment) or a target of less than 140 mm Hg (standard treatment). The primary composite outcome was myocardial infarction, other acute coronary syndromes, stroke, heart failure, or death from cardiovascular causes.
RESULTS: At 1 year, the mean systolic blood pressure was 121.4 mm Hg in the intensive-treatment group and 136.2 mm Hg in the standard-treatment group. The intervention was stopped early after a median follow-up of 3.26 years owing to a significantly lower rate of the primary composite outcome in the intensive-treatment group than in the standard-treatment group (1.65% per year vs. 2.19% per year; hazard ratio with intensive treatment, 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64 to 0.89; P<0.001). All-cause mortality was also significantly lower in the intensive-treatment group (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.90; P=0.003). Rates of serious adverse events of hypotension, syncope, electrolyte abnormalities, and acute kidney injury or failure, but not of injurious falls, were higher in the intensive-treatment group than in the standard-treatment group.
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients at high risk for cardiovascular events but without diabetes, targeting a systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg, as compared with less than 140 mm Hg, resulted in lower rates of fatal and nonfatal major cardiovascular events and death from any cause, although significantly higher rates of some adverse events were observed in the intensive-treatment group.

METHODS: Biopsy and blood DNA profiling was performed retrospectively for the year 2 scheduled biopsies and prospectively for the year 4 scheduled biopsies. Toward the end of year 2, multiple changes were made to improve sample handling and chain of custody.
RESULTS: Of the 6,458 year 2 and 4,777 year 4 biopsies, 26 biopsies reflecting 13 sample handling errors at year 2 (0.4%) and one biopsy reflecting one sample handling error at year 4 (0.02%) were confirmed to be mismatched to the patient for whom they were originally submitted.

DESIGN: Randomized, open-label, assessor-blind, parallel groups, multicenter, noninferiority trial.
SETTING: Twenty-five infertility centers in seven countries.
PATIENT(S): Seven hundred forty-nine women.
INTERVENTION(S): Controlled ovarian stimulation with hphMG or rFSH in a GnRH antagonist cycle with compulsory single-blastocyst transfer on day 5 in one fresh or subsequent frozen blastocyst replacement in natural cycles initiated within 1 year of each patient's start of treatment.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Ongoing pregnancy (primary end point) and live birth rates, as well as pharmacodynamic parameters.
RESULT(S): The ongoing pregnancy rate after a fresh cycle was 30% with hphMG versus 27% with rFSH for the per-protocol (PP) population and 29% versus 27% for the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Noninferiority of hphMG compared to rFSH was established.

Dietary modification and variety of medications can be used to attenuate the severity of sHPT. However, it is unknown whether any of these approaches can reduce the high risks of death and cardiovascular disease in patients with end-stage renal disease.
METHODS: The Evaluation of Cinacalcet HCl Therapy to Lower Cardiovascular Events (EVOLVE) trial was designed to test the hypothesis that treatment with the calcimimetic agent cinacalcet compared with placebo (on a background of conventional therapy including phosphate binders +/- vitamin D sterols) reduces time to death or non-fatal cardiovascular events (specifically myocardial infarction, unstable angina, heart failure and peripheral arterial disease events) among patients on hemodialysis with sHPT. This report describes baseline characteristics of enrolled subjects with a focus on regional variation.
RESULTS: There were 3883 subjects randomized from 22 countries, including the USA, Canada, Australia, three Latin American nations, Russia and 15 European nations.

The present study quantified net joint torques of the lower limbs and trunk in the sagittal and frontal planes following multi-directional surface translations. Twenty-one healthy subjects stood with feet on separate force plates mounted on a moveable platform, translated unexpectedly in one of 12 directions. Peak net torque magnitudes and latencies following perturbation onset were determined as were the relative contributions of each joint to total torque production. Magnitude of net torque generated by each leg varied by perturbation direction, with the largest individual joint magnitude elicited in directions of limb loading. Relative contributions of individual joint torques to the total response were dependent upon perturbation direction. Results suggest that a redistribution of the relative contributions of hip/trunk versus ankle strategies occurs dependent on perturbation direction, with a significant contribution by the knee joint in response to forward perturbations. Direction-specific redistribution of proximal versus distal strategies appears to depend upon the biomechanical constraints imposed by a given perturbation direction. Thus, it appears that sagittal and frontal plane posture-righting responses may not be uniquely controlled, and may instead be governed similarly, with modulation of relative torque contributions among joints when necessary, given direction-specific anatomical constraints.",2,PRIMARY,Change From Baseline to 11 Weeks in Oswestry Disability Scale (0-100%),Disability; Scale 0-100% Lower score is considered better/improved Negative value indicates improvement,Stabilization,Strengthening and Conditioning,"Stabilization

Stabilization exercise protocol: The stabilization exercise protocol consists of exercises focused on improving the ability of trunk muscles to stabilize the spine, beginning with training to isolate the deeper abdominal muscles as well as deep dorsal trunk muscles. Then patients were progressed to exercises that added leverage of the limbs while maintaining the co-contraction of the deeper abdominal muscles and deep dorsal trunk muscles while breathing normally. Various positions (e.g., supine and quadruped positions) were used to challenge the patients based on their tolerance. Finally, patients were progressed to exercises in more functional positions that included tasks/activities that were reported as challenging and/or painful; patients performed the tasks at the speed demanded by the particular task.

Similar to other chronic diseases, HIV requires lifetime changes in physical health, psychological functioning, social relations, and adoption of disease-specific regimens. The shift from acute to chronic illness requires a self-management model in which patients assume an active and informed role in healthcare decision making to change behaviors and social relations to optimize health and proactively address predictable challenges of chronic diseases generally and HIV specifically. This article reviews literature on chronic disease self-management to identify factors common across chronic diseases, highlight HIV-specific challenges, and review recent developments in self-management interventions for people living with HIV (PLH) and other chronic diseases. An integrated framework of common elements or tasks in chronic disease self-management is presented that outlines 14 elements in three broad categories: physical health; psychological functioning; and social relationships. Common elements for physical health include: a framework for understanding illness and wellness; health promoting behaviors; treatment adherence; self-monitoring of physical status; accessing appropriate treatment and services; and preventing transmission. Elements related to psychological functioning include: self-efficacy and empowerment; cognitive skills; reducing negative emotional states; and managing identity shifts. Social relationship elements include: collaborative relationships with healthcare providers; social support; disclosure and stigma management; and positive social and family relationships. There is a global need to scale up chronic disease self-management services, including for HIV, but there are significant challenges related to healthcare system and provider capacities, and stigma is a significant barrier to HIV-identified service utilization. Recognizing that self-management of HIV has more in common with all chronic diseases than differences suggests that the design and delivery of HIV support services can be incorporated into combined or integrated prevention and wellness services.",2,PRIMARY,Mean Change in Knowledge and Awareness About Vaccine-Preventable Diseases,"Knowledge and awareness about the target vaccine-preventable diseases was assessed at each timepoint using the VEPSC Knowledge Instrument, a 3-section, 22-item instrument categorical response instrument.

METHODS: Equal numbers of knee pain positive and negative respondents to a survey of registrants aged more than 55 years at a general practice were invited to attend for knee radiographs and quadriceps femoris isometric strength estimations. Disability was measured using the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire.
RESULTS: Complete data were available on 70 men (mean age 72.7 years) and 89 women (mean age 68.1 years); 44% reported knee pain, 48% had radiographic features of osteoarthritis, and 32% reported some degree of disability.

Treatment duration was event-driven, and interim analyses were planned and conducted after approximately 120 and 200 progression-free survival events, respectively, occurred. We compared treatment groups with the stratified log-rank test. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01769196.
FINDINGS: Patients with IPF were recruited between Jan 31, 2013, and June 1, 2015. The intention-to-treat population included 544 randomly assigned patients (272 patients in both groups), and the safety population included 543 randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study medication. The study was terminated when the second interim analysis met the prespecified futility stopping criteria in the intention-to-treat population. We noted no difference in progression-free survival between simtuzumab and placebo in the intention-to-treat population (median progression free survival times of 12·6 months and 15·4 months for simtuzumab and placebo, respectively; stratified HR 1·13, 95% CI 0·88-1·45; p=0·329) and in patients with baseline sLOXL2 in the 50th percentile or higher (median progression-free survival 11·7 months and 14·3 months for simtuzumab and placebo, respectively; stratified HR 1·03, 95% CI 0·74-1·43; p=0·851), or in the 75th percentile or higher (median progression-free survival 11·6 months and 16·9 months for simtuzumab and placebo, respectively; stratified HR 1·20, 95% CI 0·72-2·00; p=0·475). The incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events was similar between treatment groups. The most common adverse events in both the simtuzumab and placebo groups were dyspnoea, cough, upper respiratory tract infection, and worsening of IPF; and the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were worsening of IPF, dyspnoea, and pneumonia.
INTERPRETATION: Simtuzumab did not improve progression-free survival in a well-defined population of patients with IPF. Our data do not support the use of simtuzumab for patients with IPF.

More complex regimens were related to decreased adherence, but were often successfully mitigated by regimen aids. Social and psychological factors reflecting emotional adjustment to HIV/AIDS and provider support were related to adherence. Access to institutional resources was associated with better adherence. Personal attributes showed a mixed relationship; gender was not consistently related to adherence, but younger age, minority status, and a history of substance abuse were often related to non-adherence.

Behavioral economics has stimulated renewed interest in economic-based, population-level health interventions to address this issue. Despite widespread implementation of financial incentive-based public health and workplace wellness policies, the effects of financial incentives on exercise initiation and maintenance in adults remain unclear.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic search of 15 electronic databases for RCTs reporting the impact of financial incentives on exercise-related behaviors and outcomes was conducted in June 2012. A meta-analysis of exercise session attendance among included studies was conducted in April 2013. A qualitative analysis was conducted in February 2013 and structured along eight features of financial incentive design.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Eleven studies were included (N=1453; ages 18-85 years and 50% female). Pooled results favored the incentive condition (z=3.81, p<0.0001). Incentives also exhibited significant, positive effects on exercise in eight of the 11 included studies. One study determined that incentives can sustain exercise for longer periods (>1 year), and two studies found exercise adherence persisted after the incentive was withdrawn. Promising incentive design feature attributes were noted. Assured, or ""sure thing,"" incentives and objective behavioral assessment in particular appear to moderate incentive effectiveness. Previously sedentary adults responded favorably to incentives 100% of the time (n=4).
CONCLUSIONS: The effect estimate from the meta-analysis suggests that financial incentives increase exercise session attendance for interventions up to 6 months in duration. Similarly, a simple count of positive (n=8) and null (n=3) effect studies suggests that financial incentives can increase exercise adherence in adults in the short term (<6 months).",2,PRIMARY,Changes in Diastolic Blood Pressure From Baseline to the End of Intervention (December 2015),Changes in diastolic blood pressure from baseline to end of study.

To analyze the mechanisms of catecholamine-induced NK cell trafficking, normal healthy male human subjects and splenectomized individuals were infused with either adrenaline (0.10 microgram/kg/min), noradrenaline (0.15 microgram/kg/min), or NaCl i.v. for 20 min. Lymphocyte subsets (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+) transiently increased after administration of both catecholamines, with most pronounced increases (up to 600%) in NK cell numbers (CD16+ or CD56+) after infusion of adrenaline. These changes in NK cell numbers and function were accompanied neither by alterations in expression of adhesion molecules (CD11a), CD11b, CD31, CD43, CD44, CD62L) on NK cells nor by changes in plasma concentrations of soluble (s) adhesion molecules (sVCAM-1, sICAM-1, sE-selectin). Comparable increases in lymphocyte subsets were observed in splenectomized subjects, suggesting lymphocyte recruitment from other sources than the spleen. Furthermore, catecholamine-induced increases in lymphocyte subsets could be inhibited by pretreatment with the nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol, but not by the beta1-selective antagonist bisoprolol.

METHODS AND RESULTS: In two randomized, double-blind studies (ODYSSEY FH I, n = 486; FH II, n = 249), patients were randomized 2 : 1 to alirocumab 75 mg or placebo every 2 weeks (Q2W). Alirocumab dose was increased at Week 12 to 150 mg Q2W if Week 8 LDL-C was ≥1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL). Primary endpoint (both studies) was percentage change in calculated LDL-C from baseline to Week 24. Mean LDL-C levels decreased from 3.7 mmol/L (144.7 mg/dL) at baseline to 1.8 mmol/L (71.3 mg/dL; -57.9% vs. placebo) at Week 24 in patients randomized to alirocumab in FH I and from 3.5 mmol/L (134.6 mg/dL) to 1.8 mmol/L (67.7 mg/dL; -51.4% vs. placebo) in FH II (P < 0.0001). These reductions were maintained through Week 78. LDL-C <1.8 mmol/L (regardless of cardiovascular risk) was achieved at Week 24 by 59.8 and 68.2% of alirocumab-treated patients in FH I and FH II, respectively. Adverse events resulted in discontinuation in 3.4% of alirocumab-treated patients in FH I (vs. 6.1% placebo) and 3.6% (vs. 1.2%) in FH II. Rate of injection site reactions in alirocumab-treated patients was 12.4% in FH I and 11.4% in FH II (vs. 11.0 and 7.4% with placebo).
CONCLUSION: In patients with HeFH and inadequate LDL-C control at baseline despite maximally tolerated statin ± other LLT, alirocumab treatment resulted in significant LDL-C lowering and greater achievement of LDL-C target levels and was well tolerated.

Low BMD in AN is a consequence of nutritional and hormonal alterations, including hypogonadism and low estradiol levels. Effective therapeutic strategies to improve BMD in adolescents with AN have not been identified. Specifically, high estrogen doses given as an oral contraceptive do not improve BMD. The impact of physiologic estrogen doses that mimic puberty on BMD has not been examined. We enrolled 110 girls with AN and 40 normal-weight controls 12 to 18 years of age of similar maturity.

This study evaluated the effects of a cholinesterase inhibitor on gastrointestinal and colonic transit and bowel function in diabetic patients with constipation.
DESIGN: After a 9-day baseline period, 30 patients (mean ± SEM age 50 ± 2 years) with diabetes mellitus (18 type 1, 12 type 2) and chronic constipation without defaecatory disorder were randomised to oral placebo or pyridostigmine, starting with 60 mg three times a day, increasing by 60 mg every third day up to the maximum tolerated dose or 120 mg three times a day; this dose was maintained for 7 days.

METHODS: This phase 3, parallel-group, double-blind, randomised, non-inferiority trial was undertaken in seven sites in Africa and three sites in southeast Asia. In a double-dummy design, patients aged 3-60 years with uncomplicated P falciparum malaria were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive pyronaridine-artesunate once a day or artemether-lumefantrine twice a day, orally for 3 days, plus respective placebo. Randomisation was done by computer-generated randomisation sequence in blocks of nine by study centre. Intervention tablets contained 180 mg pyronaridine and 60 mg artesunate; control tablets contained 20 mg artemether and 120 mg lumefantrine. Both treatments were given according to bodyweight. The primary efficacy outcome was PCR-corrected adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) rate at day 28 in the per-protocol population. Non-inferiority was shown if the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the difference between groups was greater than -5%. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00422084.
FINDINGS: 1272 patients were randomly assigned to treatment (pyronaridine-artesunate, n=849; artemether-lumefantrine, n=423). The per-protocol population consisted of 784 patients in the pyronaridine-artesunate group and 386 patients in the artemether-lumefantrine group. PCR-corrected ACPR rate at day 28 was 99.5% (780 patients; 95% CI 98.7-99.9) in the pyronaridine-artesunate group and 99.2% (383 patients; 95% CI 97.7-99.8) in the artemether-lumefantrine group (treatment difference 0.3%, 95% CI -0.7 to 1.8; p=0.578). There were 509 (60.0%) adverse events in 849 patients assigned to pyronaridine-artesunate and 241 (57.0%) in 423 patients assigned to artemether-lumefantrine. The most frequent drug-related adverse event was eosinophilia (pyronaridine-artesunate, 53 events [6.2%]; artemether-lumefantrine 24 events [5.7%]). 21 (2.5%) patients in the pyronaridine-artesunate group and seven (1.7%) in the artemether-lumefantrine group discontinued study drugs or were withdrawn from the study. Mild and transient increases in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase concentrations were seen in the pyronaridine-artesunate group but not in the artemether-lumefantrine group.
INTERPRETATION: Efficacy of pyronaridine-artesunate was non-inferior to that of artemether-lumefantrine for treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria. Pyronaridine-artesunate should be considered for inclusion in malaria treatment programmes.

ODYSSEY HIGH FH (NCT01617655) assessed the efficacy and safety of alirocumab, a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 monoclonal antibody, versus placebo in patients with heFH and LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dl despite maximally tolerated statin ± other LLT.
METHODS: Patients were randomized to subcutaneous alirocumab 150 mg or placebo every 2 weeks (Q2W) for 78 weeks. The primary endpoint was percent change in LDL-C from baseline to week 24.
RESULTS: Mean baseline LDL-C levels were 196.3 mg/dl in the alirocumab (n = 71) and 201.0 mg/dl in the placebo groups (n = 35). Significant mean (standard error [SE]) reductions in LDL-C from baseline to week 24 were observed with alirocumab (-45.7 [3.5] %) versus placebo (-6.6 [4.9] %), a difference of -39.1 (6.0) % (P < 0.0001). Absolute mean (SE) LDL-C levels were reduced from baseline by 90.8 (6.7) mg/dl with alirocumab at week 24, with reductions maintained to week 78. Treatment-emergent adverse events were generally comparable between groups. Injection-site reactions were more frequent in the alirocumab group (8.3 %) versus placebo (5.7 %); most were mild in severity and did not result in study medication discontinuation.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with heFH and very high LDL-C baseline levels despite maximally tolerated statin ± other LLT, alirocumab 150 mg Q2W demonstrated significant reductions in LDL-C levels with 41 % of patients achieving predefined LDL-C goals.

Using only subgroups of nonvertebral fractures for trial outcomes may underestimate the benefits and cost-effectiveness of treatments. The objectives of this study were to determine (1) the effect of antiresorptive treatment on various nonvertebral fracture outcomes, (2) whether risk reduction from antiresorptive treatment is greater for nonvertebral fractures that have stronger associations with low BMD, and (3) sample size estimates for clinical trials of osteoporosis treatments. Study-level data were combined from five randomized fracture-prevention trials of antiresorptive agents that reduce the risk of nonvertebral fracture in postmenopausal women: alendronate, clodronate, denosumab, lasofoxifene, and zoledronic acid. Pooled effect estimates were calculated with random-effects models. The five trials included 30,118 women; 2997 women had at least one nonvertebral fracture. There was no significant heterogeneity between treatments for any outcome (all p > 0.10). Antiresorptive treatment had similar effects on all fractures (summary hazard ratio [HR] = 0.76, 95% CI 0.70-0.81), high-trauma fractures (HR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.57-0.96), low-trauma fractures (HR = 0.77, (95% CI 0.71-0.83), nonvertebral six (ie, hip, pelvis, leg, wrist, humerus, and clavicle) fractures (HR = 0.73, 95% CI 0.66-0.80), other than nonvertebral six fractures (HR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.70-0.87), and all fractures other than finger, face, and toe (HR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.70-0.81). Risk reduction was not greater for fractures with stronger associations with low BMD (p = 0.77). A trial of all nonvertebral fractures would require fewer participants (n = 2641 per arm) than one of a subgroup of six fractures (n = 3289), for example.

We aimed to examine associations of quantitative gastrointestinal and psychological traits with obesity, and to validate the ability of these traits to predict responses of obese individuals to pharmacotherapy.
METHODS: In a prospective study, we measured gastric emptying of solids and liquids, fasting and postprandial gastric volume, satiation by nutrient drink test (volume to fullness and maximal tolerated volume), satiety after an ad libitum buffet meal, gastrointestinal hormones, and psychological traits in 328 normal-weight, overweight, or obese adults. We also analyzed data from 181 previously studied adults to assess associations betwecen a subset of traits with body mass index and waist circumference. Latent dimensions associated with overweight or obesity were appraised by principal component analyses. We performed a proof of concept, placebo-controlled trial of extended-release phentermine and topiramate in 24 patients to validate associations between quantitative traits and response to weight-loss therapy.
RESULTS: In the prospective study, obesity was associated with fasting gastric volume (P = .03), accelerated gastric emptying (P < .001 for solids and P = .011 for liquids), lower postprandial levels of peptide tyrosine tyrosine (P = .003), and higher postprandial levels of glucagon-like peptide 1 (P < .001). In a combined analysis of data from all studies, obesity was associated with higher volume to fullness (n = 509; P = .038) and satiety with abnormal waist circumference (n = 271; P = .016). Principal component analysis identified latent dimensions that accounted for approximately 81% of the variation among overweight and obese subjects, including satiety or satiation (21%), gastric motility (14%), psychological factors (13%), and gastric sensorimotor factors (11%). The combination of phentermine and topiramate caused significant weight loss, slowed gastric emptying, and decreased calorie intake; weight loss in response to phentermine and topiramate was significantly associated with calorie intake at the prior satiety test.

One hundred thirty-eight Black and mixed-race mother-father dyads participated. Coparent dyads were randomly assigned to either a treatment as usual (TAU) group, receiving referrals and navigation support to existing community services (control), or to TAU plus invitation to a series of six dyadic Focused Coparenting Consultation (FCC) sessions led by a male-female mentor team (intervention). Seventy-one percent of those prenatally assessed were later reassessed at 3 months postpartum. Both mothers and fathers contributed reports of coparenting, father engagement, physical and psychological intimate partner violence (IPV), and depressive symptoms. Intent-to-treat analyses indicated: (a) some evidence that mothers in the intervention group reported more positive coparenting communication at 3 months postpartum than did control group mothers; (b) mothers in the intervention group reported significantly more time spent by fathers with the child than did control group mothers; (c) parents in the intervention group had significant reductions in psychological IPV compared to parents in the control group; and (d) both mothers and fathers showed reductions in self-reported depression over time, with no differential impact of group.

The allergen challenge chamber (ACC) has been developed as a pharmacodynamic assessment tool to control the environmental allergens and to avoid all problems associated with unpredictable pollen seasons.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the onset of action and efficacy of 300-IR (index of reactivity) SLIT tablets by using an ACC.
METHODS: Patients with grass pollen-induced rhinoconjunctivitis were randomized into the active or placebo groups. A standardized allergen challenge with grass pollen and symptom evaluation every 15 minutes was performed at baseline, 1 week, and 1, 2, and 4 months of treatment. The primary end point was the average rhinoconjunctivitis total symptom score (ARTSS).

Six months after the end of interferon treatment,21034680,"Prophylactic treatment with escitalopram of pegylated interferon alfa-2a-induced depression in hepatitis C: a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.","BACKGROUND: Depression is one of the main reasons for treatment withdrawal and failure in chronic hepatitis C patients treated with interferon. Antidepressants are useful for its treatment, but whether they can also be used for prevention has yet to be established.
METHOD: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of escitalopram for preventing interferon alfa-2a-induced depression, we conducted an investigator-initiated multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 133 chronic hepatitis C patients without baseline mental disorders who were randomly assigned to receive escitalopram or placebo during the first 12 weeks of treatment. Primary efficacy outcomes were the development of DSM-IV major depression and scores on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Primary safety end points were biochemical and virological responses. Patients were recruited between March 2005 and July 2006.
RESULTS: Rates of major depression were low (5.4%) and did not differ between placebo (3.2%) and escitalopram (7.6%). MADRS and HADS scores significantly increased during treatment (P < .001 and P = .028, respectively), but there were no differences between treatment groups. Sustained virological response was achieved by 69.2% of patients, 70.4% in the placebo group and 67.9% in the escitalopram group.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings do not support the use of an antidepressant to prevent interferon-induced depression during the first 12 weeks of treatment in chronic hepatitis C patients at low psychiatric risk. Future studies should be directed to subpopulations of patients at high psychiatric risk.

We aimed to test whether lowering the heart rate with ivabradine reduces cardiovascular death and morbidity in patients with coronary artery disease and left-ventricular systolic dysfunction.
METHODS: Between December, 2004, and December, 2006, we screened 12 473 patients at 781 centres in 33 countries. We enrolled 10 917 eligible patients who had coronary artery disease and a left-ventricular ejection fraction of less than 40% in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial. 5479 patients received 5 mg ivabradine, with the intention of increasing to the target dose of 7.5 mg twice a day, and 5438 received matched placebo in addition to appropriate cardiovascular medication. The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular death, admission to hospital for acute myocardial infarction, and admission to hospital for new onset or worsening heart failure. We analysed patients by intention to treat. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00143507.
FINDINGS: Mean heart rate at baseline was 71.6 (SD 9.9) beats per minute (bpm). Median follow-up was 19 months (IQR 16-24). Ivabradine reduced heart rate by 6 bpm (SE 0.2) at 12 months, corrected for placebo. Most (87%) patients were receiving beta blockers in addition to study drugs, and no safety concerns were identified. Ivabradine did not affect the primary composite endpoint (hazard ratio 1.00, 95% CI 0.91-1.1, p=0.94). 1233 (22.5%) patients in the ivabradine group had serious adverse events, compared with 1239 (22.8%) controls (p=0.70). In a prespecified subgroup of patients with heart rate of 70 bpm or greater, ivabradine treatment did not affect the primary composite outcome (hazard ratio 0.91, 95% CI 0.81-1.04, p=0.17), cardiovascular death, or admission to hospital for new-onset or worsening heart failure. However, it did reduce secondary endpoints: admission to hospital for fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction (0.64, 95% CI 0.49-0.84, p=0.001) and coronary revascularisation (0.70, 95% CI 0.52-0.93, p=0.016).

Acceptance and commitment therapy, a promising intervention for cancer-related suffering, has rarely been applied to dyads coping with advanced cancer.
AIM: To examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of acceptance and commitment therapy for patient-caregiver dyads coping with advanced gastrointestinal cancer. Primary outcomes were patient fatigue interference and caregiver burden.
DESIGN: In this pilot trial, dyads were randomized to six weekly sessions of telephone-delivered acceptance and commitment therapy or education/support, an attention control. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and at 2 weeks and 3 months post-intervention.
SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Forty patients with stage III-IV gastrointestinal cancer and fatigue interference and family caregivers with burden or distress were recruited from two oncology clinics and randomized.
RESULTS: The eligibility screening rate (54%) and retention rate (81% at 2 weeks post-intervention) demonstrated feasibility. At 2 weeks post-intervention, acceptance and commitment therapy participants reported high intervention helpfulness (mean = 4.25/5.00). Group differences in outcomes were not statistically significant. However, when examining within-group change, acceptance and commitment therapy patients showed moderate decline in fatigue interference at both follow-ups, whereas education/support patients did not show improvement at either follow-up. Acceptance and commitment therapy caregivers showed medium decline in burden at 2 weeks that was not sustained at 3 months, whereas education/support caregivers showed little change in burden.
CONCLUSIONS: Acceptance and commitment therapy showed strong feasibility, acceptability, and promise and warrants further testing.

Different pharmacological agents are currently used in several combinations to control the inflammatory process. Recently, antibodies against the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha appeared to be very effective in treating patients with Crohn's disease. However, due to the fact that the pathogen causing IBD is still unknown, no causative treatment is currently available that is able to make the disease disappear. Recently, the hygiene hypothesis of the development of immunological diseases was proposed, stating that raising children in extremely hygienic environments with less exposure to parasite infections may negatively affect the development of the immune system, predisposing them to immunologic diseases such as IBD. This hypothesis is supported by experimental data showing that helminthic parasites protect against T helper (TH) type 1 cell-mediated gastrointestinal inflammations like Crohn's disease. Both TH-2 cells and regulatory T cells may be involved in this immunomodulatory mechanism.

Abnormal anatomical conditions may make the procedure difficult or impossible. The aim of this study was to investigate whether pre-puncture ultrasound examination of the spinal anatomy might be beneficial in expected cases of difficult epidural anaesthesia.
METHODS: We used digital ultrasound equipment with a 5-MHz transducer to assess the anatomy of the ES and the posterior parts of the spinal column. We examined 72 parturients with abnormal anatomical conditions who were scheduled for epidural anaesthesia. The women were randomised into two equal groups. In all patients, the standard loss of resistance technique was used. In the ultrasound group, an ultrasound examination of the appropriate spinal region was conducted prior to epidural puncture. ES depth seen on the ultrasound images was compared to the ES depth measured by the needle. We compared the number of puncture attempts with the standard method (control group) to the number of attempts under ultrasound guidance.

Despite many positive studies and comprehensive reviews, the method is not widely accepted as a combination to radiotherapy. Modulated electrohyperthermia (mEHT; capacitive, electric field modulated, 13.56 MHz) has been used in clinical practice for almost 2 decades in Germany, Austria and Hungary. This in vivo study in nude mice xenograft tumors compares mEHT with ""classic"" radiative hyperthermia (radHT).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Nude mice were xenografted with HT29 human colorectal carcinoma cells. 28 mice in four groups with seven animals each and two tumors per animal (totally 56 tumors) were included in the present study: group 1 as untreated control; group 2 treated with radHT at 42 degrees C; group 3 treated with mEHT at identical 42 degrees C; group 4 treated with mEHT at 38 degrees C (by intensively cooling down the tumor). 24 h after treatment, animals were sacrificed and the tumor cross sections studied by precise morphological methods for the respective relative amount of ""dead"" tumor cells.
RESULTS: The effect of mEHT established a double effect as a synergy between the purely thermal (temperature-dependent) and nonthermal (not directly temperature-dependent) effects. The solely thermal enhancement ratio (TER) of cell killing was shown to be 2.9. The field enhancement ratio (FER) at a constant temperature of 42 degrees C was measured as 3.2.

Week 12,22701099,Dapagliflozin: an evidence-based review of its potential in the treatment of type-2 diabetes.,"Dapagliflozin is a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor that lowers plasma glucose by decreasing its renal reabsorption. The resulting excretion of glucose in the urine (glucosuria) has transformed what was once solely regarded as an adverse facet of diabetes into a potential novel therapeutic strategy. Glucosuria leads to weight loss, due to a reduction in calories, which is thought to rehabilitate insulin sensitivity, at least partially. By acting independently of insulin action or secretion, dapagliflozin appears to avert or minimize two key barriers to optimal glycemic control: hypoglycemia and weight gain. From the clinical studies conducted thus far in patients with type 2 diabetes, dapagliflozin significantly decreases HbA(1c) (by ~0.5%-1%, from a baseline of 8%-9%), as well as body weight (~2-3 kg), without increased risk of hypoglycemia. Dapagliflozin thus represents a paradigm shift in the treatment of diabetes.

We previously showed that HDL(3) of subjects with coronary artery disease is enriched in apolipoprotein E and that the lipoprotein carries a distinct protein cargo. This observation suggests that altered protein composition might affect the antiatherogenic and antiinflammatory properties of HDL. We hypothesized that an intervention that increases HDL levels-combined statin and niacin therapy-might reverse these changes.
METHODS AND RESULTS: HDL(3) isolated from 6 coronary artery disease subjects before and 1 year after combination therapy was analyzed by liquid chromatography-Fourier transform-mass spectrometry. Alterations in protein composition were detected by spectral counting and confirmed with extracted ion chromatograms. We found that combination therapy decreased the abundance of apolipoprotein E in HDL(3) while increasing the abundance of other macrophage proteins implicated in reverse cholesterol transport. Treatment-induced decreases in apolipoprotein E levels of HDL(3) were validated biochemically in a second group of 18 coronary artery disease subjects. Interestingly, the changes in HDL(3) proteome with niacin/statin treatment resulted in a protein composition that more closely resembled that of HDL(3) in healthy control subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: Combined statin and niacin therapy partially reverses the changes in the protein composition seen in HDL(3) in coronary artery disease subjects.

The aim of the present study was to compare genome-wide gene expression and biological functions of human GC and CC. Individual GC and CC were derived from 37 women undergoing IVF procedures. Gene expression analysis was performed using microarrays, followed by a meta-analysis. Results were validated using quantitative real-time PCR. There were 6029 differentially expressed genes (q < 10-4); of which 650 genes had a log2 FC ≥ 2. After the meta-analysis there were 3156 genes differentially expressed. Among these there were genes that have previously not been reported in human somatic follicular cells, like prokineticin 2 (PROK2), higher expressed in GC, and pregnancy up-regulated nonubiquitous CaM kinase (PNCK), higher expressed in CC.

The aim of this investigation was to assess and quantify the severity of neuromuscular blockade in patients with signs or symptoms of critical respiratory events (CREs) in the PACU.
METHODS: We collected data over a 1-yr period. PACU nurses identified patients with evidence of a predefined CRE during the first 15 min of PACU admission. Train-of-four (TOF) ratios were immediately quantified in these patients using acceleromyography (cases). TOF data were also collected in a control group that consisted of patients undergoing a general anesthetic during the same period who were matched with the cases by age, sex, and surgical procedure.
RESULTS: A total of 7459 patients received a general anesthetic during the 1-yr period, of whom 61 developed a CRE. Forty-two of these cases were matched with controls and constituted the study group for statistical analysis. The most common CREs among matched cases were severe hypoxemia (22 of 42 patients; 52.4%) and upper airway obstruction (15 of 42 patients; 35.7%). There were no significant differences between the cases and matched controls in any measured preoperative or intraoperative variables. Mean (+/-sd) TOF ratios were 0.62 (+/-0.20) in the cases, with 73.8% of the cases having TOF ratios <0.70. In contrast, TOF values in the controls were 0.98 (+/-0.07) (a difference of -0.36 with a 95% confidence interval of -0.43 to -0.30, P < 0.0001), and no control patients were observed to have TOF values <0.70 (the 95% confidence interval of the difference was 59%-85%, P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: A high incidence of severe residual blockade was observed in patients with CREs, which was absent in control patients without CREs.

METHODS: One-hundred twenty women were randomly assigned to receive either 5 mL of intrauterine 2% lidocaine or saline and either 550 mg of naproxen sodium or a similar-appearing placebo tablet. Subsequently, each woman completed a 10-cm visual analog scale for subjective pain experience and a physician scored visible signs of the women's distress during the procedure using a 3-point observer scale.
RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between the 4 groups in age, vaginal parity, history of chronic pelvic pain, menopausal status, tenaculum use, previous endometrial biopsy, or difficulty in passing the cervical os. The mean pain scores of the women in the naproxen only (5.8 +/- 2.2) and lidocaine only (5.9 +/- 2.2) groups were not significantly different compared with placebo group (7.1 +/- 2.0). However, the mean pain score in the lidocaine plus naproxen group (4.6 +/- 1.8) compared with the placebo group showed significant reduction in pain (P <.05). Pain rated by the physician was significantly lower in the lidocaine plus naproxen group compared with other groups, and a significant correlation was noted between the visual analog pain score and the patients' distress recorded by the physician (r =.791, P <.001).

Amongst others, they not only have a profound impact on affected individuals through their symptomatology, but also regarding cognition, brain structure and function. Cognitive impairment influences patients' quality of life as well as their ability to work and being employed. While exercise therapy has been implemented in the treatment of psychiatric conditions since the days of Kraepelin and Bleuler, the underlying mechanisms have never been systematically studied. Since the early 1990s, studies emerged examining the effect of physical exercise in animal models, revealing stimulation of neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and neurotransmission. Based on that body of work, clinical studies have been carried out in both healthy humans and in patient populations. These studies differ with regard to homogenous study samples, sample size, type and duration of exercise, outcome variables and measurement techniques.

SUMMARY ANSWER: The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were comparable between treatment groups and the safety profile of both treatment regimens was favourable.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Although meta-analyses of clinical trials have suggested some beneficial effect on reproductive outcomes with r-hLH supplementation in patients with POR, the definitions of POR were heterogeneous and limit the comparability across studies.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Phase III, single-blind, active-comparator, randomized, parallel-group clinical trial. Patients were followed for a single ART cycle. A total of 939 women were randomized (1:1) to receive either r-hFSH/r-hLH or r-hFSH. Randomization, stratified by study site and participant age, was conducted via an interactive voice response system.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Women classified as having POR, based on criteria incorporating the ESHRE Bologna criteria, were down-regulated with a long GnRH agonist protocol and following successful down-regulation were randomized (1:1) to COS with r-hFSH/r-hLH or r-hFSH alone. The primary efficacy endpoint was the number of oocytes retrieved following COS. Safety endpoints included the incidence of adverse events, including ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Post hoc analyses investigated safety outcomes and correlations between live birth and baseline characteristics (age and number of oocytes retrieved in previous ART treatment cycles or serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH)). The significance of the treatment effect was tested by generalized linear models (Poisson regression for counts and logistic regression for binary endpoints) adjusting for age and country.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Of 949 subjects achieving down-regulation, 939 were randomized to r-hFSH/r-hLH (n = 477) or r-hFSH (n = 462) and received treatment. Efficacy assessment: In the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, the mean (SD) number of oocytes retrieved (primary endpoint) was 3.3 (2.71) in the r-hFSH/r-hLH group compared with 3.6 (2.82) in the r-hFSH group (between-group difference not statistically significant). The observed difference between treatment groups (r-hFSH/r-hLH and r-hFSH, respectively) for efficacy outcomes decreased over the course of pregnancy (biochemical pregnancy rate: 17.3% versus 23.9%; clinical pregnancy rate: 14.1% versus 16.8%; ongoing pregnancy rate: 11.0% versus 12.4%; and live birth rate: 10.6% versus 11.7%). An interaction (identified post hoc) between baseline characteristics related to POR and treatment effect was noted for live birth, with r-hFSH/r-hLH associated with a higher live birth rate for patients with moderate or severe POR, whereas r-hFSH was associated with a higher live birth rate for those with mild POR. A post hoc logistic regression analysis indicated that the incidence of total pregnancy outcome failure was lower in the r-hFSH/r-hLH group (6.7%) compared with the r-hFSH group (12.4%) with an odds ratio of 0.52 (95% CI 0.33, 0.82; P = 0.005). Safety assessment: The overall proportion of patients with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurring during or after r-hFSH/r-hLH or r-hFSH use (stimulation or post-stimulation phase) was 19.9% and 26.8%, respectively. There was no consistent pattern of TEAEs associated with either treatment.
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Despite using inclusion criteria for POR incorporating the ESHRE Bologna criteria, further investigation is needed to determine the impact of the heterogeneity of POR in the Bologna patient population. The observed correlation between baseline clinical characteristics related to POR and live birth rate, as well as the observed differences between groups regarding total pregnancy outcome failure were from post hoc analyses, and the study was not powered for these endpoints. In addition, the attrition rate for pregnancy outcomes in this trial may not reflect general medical practice. Furthermore, as the patient population was predominantly White these results might not be applicable to other ethnicities.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: In the population of women with POR investigated in this study, although the number of oocytes retrieved was similar following stimulation with either a fixed-ratio combination of r-hFSH/r-hLH or r-hFSH monotherapy, post hoc analyses showed that there was a lower rate of total pregnancy outcome failure in patients receiving r-hFSH/r-hLH, in addition to a higher live birth rate in patients with moderate and severe POR. These findings are clinically relevant and require additional investigation. The benefit:risk balance of treatment with either r-hFSH/r-hLH or r-hFSH remains positive.

RESULTS: Randomization HbA1c and fasting glucose (FG) were 8.3% (67 mmol/mol) and 7.1 mmol/L for exenatide and 8.2% (66 mmol/mol) and 7.1 mmol/L for lispro. At 30 weeks postrandomization, mean HbA1c changes were noninferior for exenatide compared with lispro (-1.13 and -1.10%, respectively); treatment differences were -0.04 (95% CI -0.18, 0.11) in per-protocol (n = 510) and -0.03 (95% CI -0.16, 0.11) in intent-to-treat (n = 627) populations. FG was lower with exenatide than lispro (6.5 vs. 7.2 mmol/L; P = 0.002). Weight decreased with exenatide and increased with lispro (-2.5 vs. +2.1 kg; P < 0.001). More patients reported treatment satisfaction and better quality of life with exenatide than lispro, although a larger proportion of patients with exenatide experienced treatment-emergent adverse events. Exenatide resulted in fewer nonnocturnal hypoglycemic episodes but more gastrointestinal adverse events than lispro.
CONCLUSIONS: Adding exenatide to titrated glargine with metformin resulted in similar glycemic control as adding lispro and was well tolerated.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of a needling device for treatment of acne scars.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We performed a single-center, rater-blinded, balanced (1:1), split-face, placebo-controlled, parallel-group randomized clinical trial at an urban academic institution. The study took place from November 30, 2009, through July 27, 2010. Twenty healthy adults (age range, 20-65 years) with acne scars on both sides of the face were enrolled. Fifteen individuals completed the study, and no enrolled participants were withdrawn for adverse effects.
INTERVENTIONS: For each participant, one side of the face was randomized for needling. Three needling treatments were performed at 2-week intervals.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Two blinded dermatologists separately rated participants' acne scars based on standard digital photographs obtained at baseline and at the 3-month and 6-month follow-up visits on the quantitative global scarring grading system.
RESULTS: Mean scar scores were significantly lower in the treatment group compared with baseline at 6 months (mean difference, 3.4; 95% CI, 0.2-6.5; P = .03) and nominally but not significantly lower compared with baseline at 3 months (mean difference, 2.4; 95% CI, -0.01 to 4.8; P = .052). In the control group, mean scar scores did not vary significantly from baseline at 3 months (mean difference, 1.0; 95% CI, -1.4 to 3.4; P = .96) and at 6 months (mean difference, 0.4; 95% CI, -2.3 to 3.5; P > .99). The needling procedure was not particularly painful, with a mean pain rating of 1.08 of 10. Participants perceived a 41% mean improvement in overall scar appearance on the treated side. No adverse events were reported.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: After 3 needling treatments, there was improvement in the appearance of acne scars over time compared with the control group, with minimal pain reported.

As with any health care intervention, such claims require confirmation in clinical trials.
OBJECTIVES: To review controlled trials assessing the effects of computerized clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) and to identify study characteristics predicting benefit.
DATA SOURCES: We updated our earlier reviews by searching the MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Inspec, and ISI databases and consulting reference lists through September 2004. Authors of 64 primary studies confirmed data or provided additional information.
STUDY SELECTION: We included randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials that evaluated the effect of a CDSS compared with care provided without a CDSS on practitioner performance or patient outcomes.
DATA EXTRACTION: Teams of 2 reviewers independently abstracted data on methods, setting, CDSS and patient characteristics, and outcomes.
DATA SYNTHESIS: One hundred studies met our inclusion criteria. The number and methodologic quality of studies improved over time. The CDSS improved practitioner performance in 62 (64%) of the 97 studies assessing this outcome, including 4 (40%) of 10 diagnostic systems, 16 (76%) of 21 reminder systems, 23 (62%) of 37 disease management systems, and 19 (66%) of 29 drug-dosing or prescribing systems. Fifty-two trials assessed 1 or more patient outcomes, of which 7 trials (13%) reported improvements. Improved practitioner performance was associated with CDSSs that automatically prompted users compared with requiring users to activate the system (success in 73% of trials vs 47%; P = .02) and studies in which the authors also developed the CDSS software compared with studies in which the authors were not the developers (74% success vs 28%; respectively, P = .001).

We found that simvastatin (80mg o.d. for eight days) induced a rapid and significant reduction in proteinuria levels in three systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. A similar kind of therapy had a marked beneficial effect in a patient with Wegener's granulomatosis and a patient with erythema nodosum. On the other hand, five patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who received atorvastatin for eight days (20mg/day) showed reduction in C-reactive protein levels and a clinical improvement that was classified as an ACR20 response. Prior to the administration of statins, all these patients had received aggressive conventional therapy with no satisfactory response. A significant reduction in spontaneous apoptosis of peripheral blood lymphocytes and expression of CD69 and HLA-DR was observed in SLE patients after simvastatin therapy. These results prompted us to perform a pilot short-time comparative (simvastatin versus chloroquine) open clinical trial in 15 patients with RA who were receiving methotrexate as a single disease modifying antirheumatic drug with no satisfactory response. Most patients (9/10) who received simvastatin (40mg/day) showed an ACR50 or better response after eight weeks, whereas such a response was not observed in any patient (0/5) treated with chloroquine.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with 1-3 spine metastasis with a Numerical Rating Pain Scale (NRPS) score ≥5 received 16 Gy single fraction SRS. The primary endpoint was SRS feasibility: image guidance radiation therapy (IGRT) targeting accuracy ≤2 mm, target volume coverage >90% of prescription dose, maintaining spinal cord dose constraints (10 Gy to ≤10% of the cord volume from 5-6 mm above to 5-6 mm below the target or absolute spinal cord volume <0.35 cc) and other normal tissue dose constraints. A feasibility success rate <70% was considered unacceptable for continuation of the phase 3 component. Based on the 1-sample exact binomial test with α = 0.10 (1-sided), 41 patients were required. Acute toxicity was assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0.
RESULTS: Sixty-five institutions were credentialed with spine phantom dosimetry and IGRT compliance. Forty-six patients were accrued, and 44 were eligible. There were 4 cervical, 21 thoracic, and 19 lumbar sites. Median NRPS was 7 at presentation. Final pretreatment rapid review was approved in 100%. Accuracy of image guided SRS targeting was in compliance with the protocol in 95%. The target coverage and spinal cord dose constraint were in accordance with the protocol requirements in 100% and 97%. Overall compliance for other normal tissue constraints was per protocol in 74%. There were no cases of grade 4-5 acute treatment-related toxicity.
CONCLUSIONS: The phase 2 results demonstrate the feasibility and accurate use of SRS to treat spinal metastases, with rigorous quality control, in a cooperative group setting.

We evaluated the relationship between prenatal vitamin C and E (C/E) supplementation and perinatal outcomes by maternal self-reported smoking status focusing on outcomes known to be impacted by maternal smoking.
DESIGN/SETTING/POPULATION: A secondary analysis of a multi-centre trial of vitamin C/E supplementation starting at 9-16 weeks in low-risk nulliparous women with singleton gestations.
METHODS: We examined the effect of vitamin C/E by smoking status at randomisation using the Breslow-Day test for interaction.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The trial's primary outcomes were PE and a composite outcome of pregnancy-associated hypertension (PAH) with serious adverse outcomes. Perinatal outcomes included preterm birth and abruption.
RESULTS: There were no differences in baseline characteristics within subgroups (smokers versus nonsmokers) by vitamin supplementation status. The effect of prenatal vitamin C/E on the risk of PE (P = 0.66) or PAH composite outcome (P = 0.86) did not differ by smoking status.

The extent of IH after stopping routine caffeine treatment and the potential for reducing IH with extended caffeine treatment are unknown.
OBJECTIVES: To determine (1) the frequency of IH in premature infants after discontinuation of routine caffeine treatment and (2) whether extending caffeine treatment to 40 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA) reduces IH.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A prospective randomized clinical study was conducted at 16 neonatal intensive care units in the United States, with an 18-month enrollment period. Preterm infants (<32 weeks' gestation) previously treated with caffeine were randomized to extended caffeine treatment or usual care (controls) at a PMA of at least 34 weeks but less than 37 weeks.

INTERVENTION: Continued treatment with caffeine.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Number of IH events and seconds with less than 90% hemoglobin oxygen saturation (Sao2) per hour of recording.
RESULTS: Our analysis included 95 preterm infants. In control infants, the mean (SD) time at less than 90% Sao2 at 35 and 36 weeks' PMA was 106.3 (89.0) and 100.1 (114.6) s/h, respectively.

This study investigated whether cigarette demand predicted response to contingent monetary rewards for abstinence among individuals with substance use disorders. It also sought to replicate evidence for greater price sensitivity at whole-dollar pack price transitions (ie, left-digit effects).
METHODS: Participants (N = 338) were individuals in residential substance use disorder treatment who participated in a randomized controlled trial that compared contingent vouchers to noncontingent vouchers for smoking abstinence. Baseline demand indices were used to predict number of abstinent days during the 14-day voucher period (after the reduction lead-in) and at 1 and 3 months afterward.
RESULTS: Demand indices correlated with measures of smoking and nicotine dependence. As measured by elasticity, intensity and O max, higher demand significantly predicted fewer abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings during voucher period for individuals in the noncontingent vouchers condition. Breakpoint exhibited a trend-level association with abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings. Demand indices did not predict abstinence in the contingent vouchers group, and did not predict abstinence at 1- and 3-month follow-ups. Left-digit price transitions were associated with significantly greater reductions in consumption.
CONCLUSIONS: The association of cigarette demand with smoking behavior only in the group for whom abstinence was not incentivized indicates that CPT assesses the value of smoking more than the value of money per se and that vouchers counteract the effects of the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes. Results provide initial short-term evidence of predictive validity for the CPT indices.
IMPLICATIONS: This study provides the first evidence of the validity of the CPT for predicting early response to brief advice for smoking cessation plus nicotine replacement in smokers with substance dependence. However, demand for cigarettes did not predict voucher-based treatment response, indicating that incentives serve as a powerful motivator not to smoke that acts in opposition to the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes and that the indices reflect the value of smoking more than the value of money per se.",0,PRIMARY,Average Number of Cigarettes Per Day,No Description Available,Contingency Management (CM),Noncontingent Reinforcement (NR),"Condition provides contingent monetary reinforcement for smoking reductions (first 5 days) then for smoking abstinence (subsequent 14 days).

In addition to lipid-lowering abilities, statins exhibit multiple anti-inflammatory effects. The objectives of this study were to determine whether treatment of patients with RA with lovastatin decreased CRP or reduced disease activity.
METHODS: We conducted a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled 12 week trial of lovastatin vs placebo in 64 RA patients with mild clinical disease activity but an elevated CRP. The primary efficacy end point was the reduction in mean log CRP. Secondary end points included disease activity, RF and anti-CCP antibody titres. Mechanistic end points included levels of serum cytokines. Safety was assessed; hepatic and muscle toxicities were of particular interest.
RESULTS: Baseline features were similar between groups. No significant difference in mean log CRP reduction between the two groups was observed, and disease activity did not change from baseline in either treatment group. Mechanistic analyses did not reveal significant changes in any biomarkers. A post hoc analysis of subjects not using biologic therapy demonstrated a significantly greater proportion achieving ⩾20% reduction in CRP from baseline in the lovastatin group compared with placebo (P-value = 0.007). No difference was observed in subjects receiving biologics. Lovastatin was well tolerated with no serious safety concerns.
CONCLUSION: This study showed no anti-inflammatory or clinical effects on RA disease activity after 12 weeks of treatment with lovastatin. Lovastatin had a modest effect on CRP in subjects not using biologics, suggesting statins may be anti-inflammatory in selected patients.

Greater collagen deposition has been proposed as a mechanism for the treatment of scars.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of IPL and MTS on collagen deposition.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-four imprinting control region mice were divided into three groups: untreated controls, treatment with IPL, and treatment with MTS. A single pass of IPL 10.5 J/cm(2) and five passes (total 15 strokes) of MTS were performed three times every 2 weeks. Four weeks after the last treatment, skin thickness measurements using a caliper, microscopic examination, Western blot analysis for type I collagen, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for total collagen content were performed.
RESULTS: Measured using calipers, MTS, resulted in greater skin thickness than IPL that paralleled the dermal thickness of the biopsied specimens. MTS also increased expression levels of type I collagen and total collagen content more than IPL. IPL effects were superior to control.

Whether antiandrogen therapy with radiation therapy will further improve cancer control and prolong overall survival is unknown.
METHODS: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted from 1998 through 2003, we assigned 760 eligible patients who had undergone prostatectomy with a lymphadenectomy and had disease, as assessed on pathological testing, with a tumor stage of T2 (confined to the prostate but with a positive surgical margin) or T3 (with histologic extension beyond the prostatic capsule), no nodal involvement, and a detectable PSA level of 0.2 to 4.0 ng per milliliter to undergo radiation therapy and receive either antiandrogen therapy (24 months of bicalutamide at a dose of 150 mg daily) or daily placebo tablets during and after radiation therapy. The primary end point was the rate of overall survival.
RESULTS: The median follow-up among the surviving patients was 13 years. The actuarial rate of overall survival at 12 years was 76.3% in the bicalutamide group, as compared with 71.3% in the placebo group (hazard ratio for death, 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.59 to 0.99; P=0.04). The 12-year incidence of death from prostate cancer, as assessed by means of central review, was 5.8% in the bicalutamide group, as compared with 13.4% in the placebo group (P<0.001). The cumulative incidence of metastatic prostate cancer at 12 years was 14.5% in the bicalutamide group, as compared with 23.0% in the placebo group (P=0.005). The incidence of late adverse events associated with radiation therapy was similar in the two groups. Gynecomastia was recorded in 69.7% of the patients in the bicalutamide group, as compared with 10.9% of those in the placebo group (P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The addition of 24 months of antiandrogen therapy with daily bicalutamide to salvage radiation therapy resulted in significantly higher rates of long-term overall survival and lower incidences of metastatic prostate cancer and death from prostate cancer than radiation therapy plus placebo.

OBJECTIVE: To compare effects of exenatide and insulin glargine on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus that is suboptimally controlled with metformin and a sulfonylurea.
DESIGN: 26-week multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled trial.
SETTING: 82 outpatient study centers in 13 countries.
PATIENTS: 551 patients with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycemic control (defined as hemoglobin A1c level ranging from 7.0% to 10.0%) despite combination metformin and sulfonylurea therapy.
INTERVENTION: Exenatide, 10 microg twice daily, or insulin glargine, 1 daily dose titrated to maintain fasting blood glucose levels of less than 5.6 mmol/L (<100 mg/dL).
MEASUREMENTS: Hemoglobin A1c level, fasting plasma glucose level, body weight, 7-point self-monitored blood glucose, standardized test-meal challenge, safety, and tolerability.
RESULTS: Baseline mean hemoglobin A1c level was 8.2% for patients receiving exenatide and 8.3% for those receiving insulin glargine. At week 26, both exenatide and insulin glargine reduced hemoglobin A1c levels by 1.11% (difference, 0.017 percentage point [95% CI, -0.123 to 0.157 percentage point]). Exenatide reduced postprandial glucose excursions more than insulin glargine, while insulin glargine reduced fasting glucose concentrations more than exenatide. Body weight decreased 2.3 kg with exenatide and increased 1.8 kg with insulin glargine (difference, -4.1 kg [CI, -4.6 to -3.5 kg]). Rates of symptomatic hypoglycemia were similar, but nocturnal hypoglycemia occurred less frequently with exenatide (0.9 event/patient-year versus 2.4 events/patient-year; difference, -1.6 events/patient-year [CI, -2.3 to -0.9 event/patient year]). Gastrointestinal symptoms were more common in the exenatide group than in the insulin glargine group, including nausea (57.1% vs. 8.6%), vomiting (17.4% vs. 3.7%) and diarrhea (8.5% vs. 3.0%).
LIMITATIONS: The trial was open-label and did not assess clinical complications related to diabetes. Of the 551 participants, 19.4% of those receiving exenatide and 9.7% of those receiving insulin glargine withdrew from the study. Only 21.6% of the insulin glargine group and 8.6% of the exenatide group achieved the target level for fasting plasma glucose of less than 5.6 mmol/L (<100 mg/dL).

Evidence suggests that group medical visits are effective for treating chronic pain; similarly, a number of studies demonstrate the effectiveness of certain evidence-based complementary therapies in managing pain.
OBJECTIVES: The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of the integrative medical group visit (IMGV) care model in an inner-city racially diverse outpatient clinic. IMGV combines patient-centered, non-pharmacologic strategies and principles of mindfulness-based stress-reduction with a group medical visit to reduce pain and associated symptoms.
METHODS: We surveyed patients pre and post an 8-session IMGV program to evaluate changes in pain in the last week (0-10 point scale) and comorbid symptoms including depression (Patient Health Questionaire-8 [PHQ-8]), perceived stress, and sleep quality. We also recorded referrals to the program, patients screened for eligibility, total enrollment, loss to follow-up, and attendance.
RESULTS: Seventy patients joined IMGV, and of these, 65 (93%) enrolled in the study. Over the course of 12 months, 7 groups met (median 9 patients/group; range 8-13 participants). Mean difference in pain level for all patients between baseline and 8 weeks was 0.7 (SD=2.0, P=.005). Mean difference in PHQ-8 depression score for patients with baseline score ≥5 was 2.6 (SD=4.6, P<.001). Statistically significant improvements were also seen in sleep quality and perceived stress.

The 'Trier Social Stress Test' (TSST) mainly consists of an anticipation period (10 min) and a test period (10 min) in which the subjects have to deliver a free speech and perform mental arithmetic in front of an audience. In six independent studies this protocol has been found to induce considerable changes in the concentration of ACTH, cortisol (serum and saliva), GH, prolactin as well as significant increases in heart rate. As for salivary cortisol levels, the TSST reliably led to 2- to 4-fold elevations above baseline with similar peak cortisol concentrations. Studies are summarized in which TSST-induced cortisol increases elucidated some of the multiple variables contributing to the interindividual variation in adrenocortical stress responses. The results suggest that gender, genetics and nicotine consumption can influence the individual's stress responsiveness to psychological stress while personality traits showed no correlation with cortisol responses to TSST stimulation. From these data we conclude that the TSST can serve as a tool for psychobiological research.",2,PRIMARY,Acute Stress Measured by Nervousness,"Tension and nervousness were self-assessed by the participants on a 0 to 100 millimeter (mm) Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) before and after a stress test.

We evaluated whether involving primary care providers (PCPs) in a visit-independent population management IT application led to more effective cancer screening.
METHODS: We conducted a cluster-randomized trial involving 18 primary care practice sites and 169 PCPs from June 15, 2011, to June 14, 2012. Participants included adults eligible for breast, cervical, and/or colorectal cancer screening. In practices randomized to the intervention group, PCPs reviewed real-time rosters of their patients overdue for screening and provided individualized contact (via a letter, practice delegate, or patient navigator) or deferred screening (temporarily or permanently). In practices randomized to the comparison group, overdue patients were automatically sent reminder letters and transferred to practice delegate lists for follow-up. Intervention patients without PCP action within 8 weeks defaulted to the automated control version. The primary outcome was adjusted average cancer screening completion rates over 1-year follow-up, accounting for clustering by physician or practice.
RESULTS: Baseline cancer screening rates (80.8% vs 80.3%) were similar among patients in the intervention (n = 51,071) and comparison group (n = 52,799). Most intervention providers used the IT application (88 of 101, 87%) and users reviewed 7984 patients overdue for at least 1 cancer screening (73% sent reminder letter, 6% referred directly to a practice delegate or patient navigator, and 21% deferred screening). In addition, 6128 letters were automatically sent to patients in the intervention group (total of 12,002 letters vs 16,378 letters in comparison practices; P < .001). Adjusted average cancer screening rates did not differ among intervention and comparison practices for all cancers combined (81.6% vs 81.4%; P = .84) nor breast (82.7% vs 82.7%; P = .96), cervical (84.1% vs 84.7%; P = .60), or colorectal cancer (77.8% vs 76.2%; P = .33).
CONCLUSIONS: Involving PCPs in a visit-independent population management IT application resulted in similar cancer screening rates compared with an automated reminder system, but fewer patients were sent reminder letters.

This pilot study sought to explore the feasibility of improving socioeconomic inclusion outcomes by bolstering identity capital (sense of purpose and control, self-efficacy and self-esteem) among young people who had experienced homelessness.
METHODS: Nineteen individuals (aged 18-26) who had transitioned out of homelessness within the past three years participated in a six-week, six-session program focused on building identity capital. The study employed a mixed method prospective cohort hybrid design with an intervention group (Group One) and a delayed intervention comparison group (Group Two). Participants were interviewed every three months until nine months post-intervention.
RESULTS: None of the youth who began the intervention dropped out of the program, with the exception of one participant who moved across the country and was unable to continue.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants were community dwelling women with urge predominant incontinence. Using a randomized clinical trial design women were randomized to 8 weeks (4 visits) of drug therapy alone (32) or drug therapy plus behavioral training (32). Drug therapy was individually titrated, extended release oxybutynin with proactive management of side effects. Behavioral training included pelvic floor muscle training and urge suppression techniques. The primary outcome measure was reduction in frequency of incontinence episodes on bladder diary at 8 weeks (with followup at 6 and 12 months). Secondary outcomes included patient satisfaction, global perception of improvement, Urogenital Distress Inventory and Incontinence Impact Questionnaire.
RESULTS: In intent to treat analysis frequency of incontinence was reduced a mean of 88.5% in the drug alone group and 78.3% in the combined therapy group (p = 0.16). Outcomes were not significantly different between the groups in the analysis of completers (91.5% vs 86.2%, p = 0.34), or in either analysis at 6 or 12 months.

Patients (n = 56) were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to ETC-1002 60 mg daily or placebo. The ETC-1002 dose was increased at 2-week intervals to 120 mg, 180 mg, and 240 mg. The primary end point was the percentage change from baseline to week 8 in calculated LDL-C.
RESULTS: ETC-1002 reduced LDL-C 28.7% more than placebo (95% confidence interval, -35.4 to -22.1; P < .0001). ETC-1002 significantly reduced non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol did not change with ETC-1002 treatment. Sixty-two percent of patients receiving ETC-1002 and none in the placebo group achieved the 2004 National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III LDL-C goal (P < .0001). Muscle-related adverse events occurred with similar frequency in the placebo and ETC-1002 treatment groups, causing no discontinuations in ETC-1002-treated patients.
CONCLUSIONS: ETC-1002 appears to be effective at reducing LDL-C and was well tolerated in patients with statin-associated muscle complaints. Longer and larger studies are required to confirm the absence of muscle side effects.",1,PRIMARY,Percent Change From Baseline to Week 8 in Calculated Low-Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol (LDL-C),Percent change from Baseline was calculated as the (\[post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value\] divided by the Baseline value) x 100.

However, the relationship of this neuromotor impairment to recurrent pain episodes is unknown. To assess coordination while minimizing the confounding influences of pain we characterized automatic postural responses to multi-directional support surface translations in individuals with a history of LBP who were not in an active episode of their pain. Twenty subjects with and 21 subjects without non-specific LBP stood on a platform that was translated unexpectedly in 12 directions. Net joint torques of the ankles, knees, hips, and trunk in the frontal and sagittal planes as well as surface electromyographs of 12 lower leg and trunk muscles were compared across perturbation directions to determine if individuals with LBP responded using a trunk stiffening strategy. Individuals with LBP demonstrated reduced peak trunk torques, and enhanced activation of the trunk and ankle muscle responses following perturbations. These results suggest that individuals with LBP use a strategy of trunk stiffening achieved through co-activation of trunk musculature, aided by enhanced distal responses, to respond to unexpected support surface perturbations. Notably, these neuromotor alterations persisted between active pain periods and could represent either movement patterns that have developed in response to pain or could reflect underlying impairments that may contribute to recurrent episodes of LBP.",2,PRIMARY,Change From Baseline to 11 Weeks in Numeric Pain Rating Scale (0-10 Points),Current Pain Scale 0-10 Lower score is better/improved; Negative value indicates improvement,Stabilization,Strengthening and Conditioning,"Stabilization exercise protocol: The stabilization exercise protocol consists of exercises focused on improving the ability of trunk muscles to stabilize the spine, beginning with training to isolate the deeper abdominal muscles as well as deep dorsal trunk muscles. Then patients were progressed to exercises that added leverage of the limbs while maintaining the co-contraction of the deeper abdominal muscles and deep dorsal trunk muscles while breathing normally. Various positions (e.g., supine and quadruped positions) were used to challenge the patients based on their tolerance. Finally, patients were progressed to exercises in more functional positions that included tasks/activities that were reported as challenging and/or painful; patients performed the tasks at the speed demanded by the particular task. Maintenance of the co-contraction of deep trunk muscles was emphasized during these functional activities.","Strength and conditioning exercise protocol: This protocol contained trunk strengthening and endurance exercises. It consisted of 3 phases: 1) initial strengthening of trunk flexors/extensors in single plane movements, 2) trunk and lower-extremity stretching as well as progression of trunk-strengthening exercises to include multi-planar trunk movements. Aerobic exercises were progressed as tolerated and patient education about body biomechanics were reinforced, and 3) trunk-strengthening exercises under dynamic conditions (e.g., unstable support surface and in multi-planar trunk movements). During the 10 week protocol, exercises became more challenging, and each subject had to complete at least the first phase before moving onto the next phase in order to be included in post-testing analyses.

In rats, high-frequency electrical mPFC stimulation has been shown to improve extinction by means of a reduction of amygdala activity. However, so far it is unclear whether stimulation of homologues regions in humans might have similar beneficial effects. Healthy volunteers received one session of either active or sham repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) covering the mPFC while undergoing a 2-day fear conditioning and extinction paradigm. Repetitive TMS was applied offline after fear acquisition in which one of two faces (CS+ but not CS-) was associated with an aversive scream (UCS). Immediate extinction learning (day 1) and extinction recall (day 2) were conducted without UCS delivery. Conditioned responses (CR) were assessed in a multimodal approach using fear-potentiated startle (FPS), skin conductance responses (SCR), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), and self-report scales. Consistent with the hypothesis of a modulated processing of conditioned fear after high-frequency rTMS, the active group showed a reduced CS+/CS- discrimination during extinction learning as evident in FPS as well as in SCR and arousal ratings. FPS responses to CS+ further showed a linear decrement throughout both extinction sessions. This study describes the first experimental approach of influencing conditioned fear by using rTMS and can thus be a basis for future studies investigating a complementation of mPFC stimulation to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).",2,PRIMARY,"Behavioral Approach Test, Change in Steps Completed",The difference between the number of steps completed during the pre- and post-treatment behavioral approach tests.,"Active iTBS, Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex (vmPFC)","Control iTBS, Vertex","Stimulation intensity of 100% of the individual resting motor threshold in bursts of three pulses at a frequency of 50 Hz every 200 ms on top of a 5Hz carrier wave.

We sought to demonstrate that maca root may be an effective treatment for antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction (AISD) in women. Method. We conducted a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of maca root (3.0 g/day) in 45 female outpatients (mean age of 41.5 ± 12.5 years) with SSRI/SNRI-induced sexual dysfunction whose depression remitted. Endpoints were improvement in sexual functioning as per the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX) and the Massachusetts General Hospital Sexual Function Questionnaire (MGH-SFQ). Results. 45 of 57 consented females were randomized, and 42 (30 premenopausal and 12 postmenopausal women) were eligible for a modified intent-to-treat analysis based on having had at least one postmedication visit. Remission rates by the end of treatment were higher for the maca than the placebo group, based on attainment of an ASEX total score ≤ 10 (9.5% for maca versus 4.8% for placebo), attaining an MGH-SFQ score ≤ 12 (30.0% for maca versus 20.0% for placebo) and reaching an MGH-SFQ score ≤ 8 (9.5% for maca versus 5.0% for placebo).

One strategy to prolong disease control and survival in patients with OC is maintenance therapy after achieving a complete response. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase II study to assess the efficacy and safety of maintenance therapy with sorafenib in the treatment of OC is presented.
METHODS: Patients with epithelial OC or primary peritoneal cancer in complete remission were randomized to sorafenib 400mg BID or matching placebo. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).
RESULTS: Of 246 randomized patients, 93% had OC; baseline characteristics were balanced between treatment arms. There was no significant difference between sorafenib and placebo arms for PFS (median 12.7 vs 15.7 months; hazard ratio 1.09; 95% CI 0.72-1.63), although there was a notable imbalance in early censoring. The most common ≥ grade 3 adverse events (AEs) were hand-foot skin reaction (39.0% vs 0.8%) and rash (14.6% vs 0%). More patients receiving sorafenib versus placebo required dose reductions (67.5% vs 30.1%), resulting in a lower than planned median daily dose (median 584.6 vs 800.0mg). Treatment with sorafenib was of shorter duration (median 17.6 vs 51.9 weeks) with more frequent discontinuations due to AEs (37.4% vs 6.5%).

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether combined vasopressin-epinephrine during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and corticosteroid supplementation during and after CPR improve survival to hospital discharge with a Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) score of 1 or 2 in vasopressor-requiring, in-hospital cardiac arrest.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial performed from September 1, 2008, to October 1, 2010, in 3 Greek tertiary care centers (2400 beds) with 268 consecutive patients with cardiac arrest requiring epinephrine according to resuscitation guidelines (from 364 patients assessed for eligibility).
INTERVENTIONS: Patients received either vasopressin (20 IU/CPR cycle) plus epinephrine (1 mg/CPR cycle; cycle duration approximately 3 minutes) (VSE group, n = 130) or saline placebo plus epinephrine (1 mg/CPR cycle; cycle duration approximately 3 minutes) (control group, n = 138) for the first 5 CPR cycles after randomization, followed by additional epinephrine if needed. During the first CPR cycle after randomization, patients in the VSE group received methylprednisolone (40 mg) and patients in the control group received saline placebo. Shock after resuscitation was treated with stress-dose hydrocortisone (300 mg daily for 7 days maximum and gradual taper) (VSE group, n = 76) or saline placebo (control group, n = 73).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) for 20 minutes or longer and survival to hospital discharge with a CPC score of 1 or 2.
RESULTS: Follow-up was completed in all resuscitated patients. Patients in the VSE group vs patients in the control group had higher probability for ROSC of 20 minutes or longer (109/130 [83.9%] vs 91/138 [65.9%]; odds ratio [OR], 2.98; 95% CI, 1.39-6.40; P = .005) and survival to hospital discharge with CPC score of 1 or 2 (18/130 [13.9%] vs 7/138 [5.1%]; OR, 3.28; 95% CI, 1.17-9.20; P = .02). Patients in the VSE group with postresuscitation shock vs corresponding patients in the control group had higher probability for survival to hospital discharge with CPC scores of 1 or 2 (16/76 [21.1%] vs 6/73 [8.2%]; OR, 3.74; 95% CI, 1.20-11.62; P = .02), improved hemodynamics and central venous oxygen saturation, and less organ dysfunction. Adverse event rates were similar in the 2 groups.
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with cardiac arrest requiring vasopressors, combined vasopressin-epinephrine and methylprednisolone during CPR and stress-dose hydrocortisone in postresuscitation shock, compared with epinephrine/saline placebo, resulted in improved survival to hospital discharge with favorable neurological status.

Options for cervical preparation include osmotic dilators and pharmacologic agents. Many formulations and regimens are available, and recommendations from professional organizations vary for the use of preparatory techniques in women of different ages, parity or gestational age of the pregnancy.
OBJECTIVES: To determine whether cervical preparation is necessary in the first trimester, and if so, which preparatory agent is preferred.
SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched Cochrane, Popline, Embase, Medline and Lilacs databases for randomised controlled trials investigating the use of cervical preparatory techniques prior to first trimester surgical abortion. In addition, we hand-searched key references and contacted authors to locate unpublished studies or studies not identified in the database searches.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials investigating any pharmacologic or mechanical method of cervical preparation, with the exception of nitric oxide donors (the subject of another Cochrane review), administered prior to first trimester surgical abortion were included. Outcome measures must have included the amount of cervical dilation achieved, the procedure duration or difficulty, side-effects, patient satisfaction or adverse events to be included in this review.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Trials under consideration were evaluated by considering whether inclusion criteria were met as well as methodologic quality. Fifty-one studies were included, resulting in 24 different cervical preparation comparisons. Results are reported as odds ratios (OR) for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences for continuous data.
MAIN RESULTS: When compared to placebo, misoprostol (400-600 microg given vaginally or sublingually), gemeprost, mifepristone (200 or 600 mg), prostaglandin E and F(2alpha) (2.5 mg administered intracervically) demonstrated larger cervical preparation effects. When misoprostol was compared to gemeprost, misoprostol was more effective in preparing the cervix and was associated with fewer gastrointestinal side-effects. For vaginal administration, administration 2 hours prior was less effective than administration 3 hours prior to the abortion. Compared to oral misoprostol administration, the vaginal route was associated with significantly greater initial cervical dilation and lower rates of side-effects; however, sublingual administration 2-3 hours prior to the procedure demonstrated cervical effects superior to vaginal administration.When misoprostol (600 microg oral or 800 microg vaginal) was compared to mifepristone (200 mg administered 24 hours prior to procedure), misoprostol had inferior cervical preparatory effects. Compared to day-prior laminaria tents, 200 or 400 microg vaginal misoprostol showed no differences in the need for further mechanical dilation or length of the procedure; similarly, the osmotic dilators Lamicel and Dilapan showed no differences in cervical ripening when compared to gemeprost, although gemeprost had cervical effects which were superior to laminaria tents. Older prostaglandin regimens (sulprostone, prostaglandin E(2) andF(2alpha)) were associated with high rates of gastrointestinal side-effects and unplanned pregnancy expulsions. Few studies reported women's satisfaction with cervical preparatory techniques.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Modern methods of cervical ripening are generally safe, although efficacy and side-effects between methods vary. Reports of adverse events such as cervical laceration or uterine perforation are uncommon overall in this body of evidence and no published study has investigated whether cervical preparation impacts these rare outcomes. Cervical preparation decreases the length of the abortion procedure; this may become increasingly important with increasing gestational age, as mechanical dilation at later gestational ages takes longer and becomes more difficult. These data do not suggest a gestational age where the benefits of cervical dilation outweigh the side-effects, including pain, that women experience with cervical ripening procedures or the prolongation of the time interval before procedure completion. Mifepristone 200 mg, osmotic dilators and misoprostol, 400microg administered either vaginally or sublingually, are the most effective methods of cervical preparation.",2,PRIMARY,Number of Participants Who Required Cervix Dilation at Initiation of the Manual Vacuum Aspiration,this outcome identifies patients that had to have a mechanical dilator for opening the cervix to perform appropriate Manual Vacuum Aspiration,Misoprostol 200 µg,Misoprostol 400 µg,"Misoprostol 200 µg 6 hours before intrauterine suction

METHODS: In a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study, 319 patients were randomized (1:1) to 12-week treatment with sitagliptin 50 mg once daily or voglibose 0.2 mg thrice daily before meals. The primary analysis assessed whether sitagliptin was non-inferior to voglibose in lowering HbA1c.
RESULTS: After 12 weeks, sitagliptin was non-inferior to voglibose for HbA1c-lowering efficacy. Furthermore, sitagliptin was superior to voglibose, providing significantly greater reductions in HbA1c from baseline [least squares mean changes in HbA1c [95% confidence intervals (CI)] = -0.7% (-0.8 to -0.6) and -0.3% (-0.4 to -0.2), respectively; between-group difference = -0.4% (-0.5 to -0.3), p < 0.001]. Sitagliptin was also superior to voglibose on other key efficacy endpoints, including change from baseline in 2-h postmeal glucose (-2.8 mmol/l vs. -1.8 mmol/l, p < 0.001) and fasting plasma glucose (-1.1 mmol/l vs. -0.5 mmol/l, p < 0.001).

Although glucosamine is increasingly used by patients with chronic LBP, little is known about its effect in this setting.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of glucosamine in patients with chronic LBP and degenerative lumbar OA.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted at Oslo University Hospital Outpatient Clinic, Oslo, Norway, with 250 patients older than 25 years of age with chronic LBP (>6 months) and degenerative lumbar OA.
INTERVENTIONS: Daily intake of 1500 mg of oral glucosamine (n = 125) or placebo (n = 125) for 6 months, with assessment of effect after the 6-month intervention period and at 1 year (6 months postintervention).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was pain-related disability measured with the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ). Secondary outcomes were numerical scores from pain-rating scales of patients at rest and during activity, and the quality-of-life EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) instrument. Data collection occurred during the intervention period at baseline, 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months, and again 6 months following the intervention at 1 year. Group differences were analyzed using linear mixed models analysis.
RESULTS: At baseline, mean RMDQ scores were 9.2 (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.4-10.0) for glucosamine and 9.7 (95% CI, 8.9-10.5) for the placebo group (P = .37). At 6 months, the mean RMDQ score was the same for the glucosamine and placebo groups (5.0; 95% CI, 4.2-5.8). At 1 year, the mean RMDQ scores were 4.8 (95% CI, 3.9-5.6) for glucosamine and 5.5 (95% CI, 4.7-6.4) for the placebo group. No statistically significant difference in change between groups was found when assessed after the 6-month intervention period and at 1 year: RMDQ (P = .72), LBP at rest (P = .91), LBP during activity (P = .97), and quality-of-life EQ-5D (P = .20). Mild adverse events were reported in 40 patients in the glucosamine group and 46 in the placebo group (P = .48).
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with chronic LBP and degenerative lumbar OA, 6-month treatment with oral glucosamine compared with placebo did not result in reduced pain-related disability after the 6-month intervention and after 1-year follow-up.

METHODS: Adult patients initiating ART in a public clinic in Cape Town, South Africa, were randomized to treatment-supporter DOT-ART or self-administered ART. DOT-ART patients and supporters received baseline and follow-up training and monitoring. The primary endpoints were the proportions of patients with HIV viral load less than 400 copies/ml and change in CD4 cell counts at 12 and 24 months.
RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy-four patients enrolled (137 in each arm) and baseline characteristics were similar for both arms. The study was stopped early for futility by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board. In an intention-to-treat analysis, the proportions of patients with viral load less than 400 copies/ml at 12 months were 72.8% in the DOT-ART arm and 68.4% in the Self-ART arm (P = 0.42). DOT-ART patients had greater median CD4 cell count (cells/microl) increases at 6 months [148 (IQR 84-222) vs. 111 (IQR 44-196) P = 0.02] but similar results at all other time-points. Survival was significantly better in the DOT-ART arm (9 deaths, 6.6%) than in the Self-ART arm (20 deaths, 14.6%; log-rank P = 0.02). In Cox regression analysis, mortality was independently associated with study arm [DOT vs. self-ART; HR 0.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17-0.86].
CONCLUSION: DOT-ART showed no effect on virologic outcomes but was associated with greater CD4 cell count increases at 6-month follow-up.

Heating instead of burning tobacco reduces, or eliminates, the formation of harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHC) that are found in cigarette smoke. The Carbon-Heated Tobacco Product (CHTP), a heat-not-burn tobacco product, mimics the cigarette smoking ritual. This randomized, open-label, two-arm, parallel-group, short-term confinement study tested the hypothesis that the geometric means of the BoExp levels for subjects switching to CHTP 1.0 for 5 days are lower relative to those continuing to smoke cigarettes. Biomarkers of exposure (BoExp), including nicotine, urinary excretion of mutagenic constituents (Ames test), and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 activity, were measured in blood and/or 24-h urine samples during ad libitum product use. Nicotine exposure remained at similar levels in individuals using CHTP as in those continuing to smoke cigarettes. Switching to CHTP resulted in marked decreases in all other urinary BoExp (56-97%), carboxyhemoglobin (59%), urinary mutagenic constituents, and CYP1A2 activity compared with continued cigarette smoking.

An expected average of 10 minutes after the technique..,18211995,Ultrasonographic control of the puncture level for lumbar neuraxial block in obstetric anaesthesia.,"BACKGROUND: Errors in the judgement of puncture level during neuraxial anaesthesia can lead to significant complications. The aim of this study was to assess, in obstetric anaesthesia, the accuracy of clinical determination of the lumbar spinal interspace level, using surface ultrasound imaging as control.
METHODS: At the anaesthesia follow-up visit, women who had received lumbar neuraxial anaesthesia during labour were prospectively included. The intervertebral level of needle insertion, located by the needle scar position, was identified by ultrasonography and compared with the clinical level reported on the chart by the anaesthetist who performed the block.
RESULTS: Ninety-nine women were studied. The clinical puncture level was accurate in 36.4% of patients. Ultrasound examination showed the puncture level to be more cephalad than the level noted in the anaesthetic record in almost 50% of patients. In 15% of patients, the puncture level was more caudad than the anaesthetist had assessed. Factors including type of anaesthesia, indication, time period, level of anaesthetic experience, BMI, and spinal pathology did not seem to influence the frequency of errors.
CONCLUSIONS: The observed differences between clinical and ultrasonic identification of spinal puncture level highlight the potential for serious complications associated with the performance of neuraxial blocks above the spinous process of L3 in the parturient. With the increase in popularity of techniques involving puncture of the dura mater for labour anaesthesia, we feel that awareness of this risk is important.",2,PRIMARY,Number of Attempts Required.,How many times did the operator withdraw the needle and repeated the puncture.,Ultrasound,Landmarks,Detection of the puncture site by ultrasound scan of the lumbar spine.: Neuraxial anesthesia will be performed to the patients after detection of the puncture site by ultrasound scan of the spine.

OBJECTIVES: We sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 300 index of reactivity (IR) 5-grass pollen sublingual tablet in US adults.
METHODS: Adults with grass pollen allergy and Rhinoconjunctivitis Total Symptom Scores of 12 or greater (scale, 0-18) during the previous grass pollen season were randomized in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to receive 300IR 5-grass pollen sublingual tablet or placebo starting 4 months before and continuing through the pollen season. The primary efficacy end point was the daily Combined Score (CS; scale, 0-3), which integrates symptoms and rescue medication use.
RESULTS: Four hundred seventy-three participants were randomized. The mean daily CS over the pollen period was significantly lower in the active treatment group versus the placebo group (least-squares mean difference: -0.13; 95% CI, -0.19 to -0.06; P = .0003; relative reduction: 28.2%; 95% CI, 13.0% to 43.4%).

The 9vHPV vaccine has the potential to prevent 90% of cervical cancers, HPV-related anal, vaginal and vulval cancers and anogenital warts. We compared the immunogenicity and safety of the 9vHPV vaccine versus the qHPV vaccine in 16-26-year-old men.
METHODS: Participants (N=500) were randomised to receive 9vHPV or qHPV vaccines on day 1, month 2 and month 6. Serology testing was performed on day 1 and month 7. HPV type-specific antibody titres (anti-HPV 6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58) were determined by competitive Luminex immunoassay and expressed as geometric mean titres and seroconversion rates.

RESULTS: The HPV 6/11/16/18 immune responses elicited by the 9vHPV vaccine were comparable with those elicited by the qHPV vaccine. All participants receiving the 9vHPV vaccine seroconverted for HPV 31/33/45/52/58. The 9vHPV and qHPV vaccines showed comparable safety profiles.
CONCLUSIONS: In addition to immune responses to HPV 31/33/45/52/58, a three-dose regimen of the 9vHPV vaccine elicited a similar immune response to HPV 6/11/16/18 when compared with the qHPV vaccine in men aged 16-26years.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the predictive value for the presence of CP, of some simple, economic malnutrition (MN) parameters that in a previous study showed an acceptable degree of correlation with the CP, and to estimate the economic savings derived from preventing, complications through diagnosis and early treatment of malnutrition. The sample consisted of all patients that over a one year period occupied a randomly selected 4-bed hospital surgical ward of a Comunidad Valenciana hospital. The clinical evolution and analytical and anthropometrical nutritional parameters were evaluated both at admission and upon discharge from hospital. The increase in expenses, due to presumably preventable CP secondary to MN is calculated from the number of Patient Attention Units generated (UMA's). Nutritional parameters showing a statistically significant correlation with CP are: serum albumin (AS); total lymphocytes (LT); tricipital fat skinfold (PGT); medial arm circumference (CB) and the ideal weight percentage (% PI). For all of them the confidence intervals of relative (RR) and attributable (RA) risks of CP when the patients show abnormal values in one or several of the nutritional parameters mentioned were calculated. The sensitivity, specificity and efficacy of each diagnostic test were estimated, as well as the positive (VP+) and negative (VP-) predictive values or conditional probabilities of suffering the disease in accordance with the positive or negative result of the diagnostic test. The length of stay in the hospital (EH) is directly related to MN, and this disorder increases remarkably the risk of suffering CP. AS and LT are the best values for predicting CP. When both are normal there is a 99% probability of not suffering CP and when both are low there is a 90% probability of developing CP, in particular nosocomial pneumonia (NEU). The EH resulting from the NEU suffered by the entire group of sample patients was 132 days, of which 112 correspond to patients having a low AS value upon admittance. Since the efficacy of AS determination is 93.5%, 105.7 days of EH secondary to predictable NEU could have been avoided, and this represents more than 8% of total yearly expenses of the General Surgical Unit studied. As and LT determination is simple, cheap and automated and allows detection of patients with a high risk of suffering MH. When surgery is elective it is possible to improve the patient's nutritional status prior to the operation and thus avoid many CP.

We asked whether interventions targeting clinical inertia can improve outcomes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A controlled trial over a 3-year period was conducted in a municipal hospital primary care clinic in a large academic medical center. We studied all patients (4,138) with type 2 diabetes who were seen in continuity clinics by 345 internal medicine residents and were randomized to be control subjects or to receive one of three interventions. Instead of consultative advice, the interventions were hard copy computerized reminders that provided patient-specific recommendations for management at the time of each patient's visit, individual face-to-face feedback on performance for 5 min every 2 weeks, or both.
RESULTS: Over an average patient follow-up of 15 months within the intervention site, improvements in and final HbA1c (A1C) with feedback + reminders (deltaA1C 0.6%, final A1C 7.46%) were significantly better than control (deltaA1C 0.2%, final A1C 7.84%, P < 0.02); changes were smaller with feedback only and reminders only (P = NS vs. control). Trends were similar but not significant with systolic blood pressure (sBP) and LDL cholesterol. Multivariable analysis showed that the feedback intervention independently facilitated attainment of American Diabetes Association goals for both A1C and sBP. Over a 2-year period, overall glycemic control improved in the intervention site but did not change in other primary care sites (final A1C 7.5 vs. 8.2%, P < 0.001).

We assessed the prognostic value of CTCs for overall survival (OS) and disease response in S0421, a phase III trial of docetaxel plus prednisone with or without atrasentan.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: CTCs were enumerated at baseline (day 0) and before cycle two (day 21) using CellSearch. Baseline counts and changes in counts from day 0 to 21 were evaluated for association with OS, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and RECIST response using Cox regression as well as receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves, integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) analysis, and regression trees.
RESULTS: Median day-0 CTC count was five cells per 7.5 mL, and CTCs < versus ≥ five per 7.5 mL were significantly associated with baseline PSA, bone pain, liver disease, hemoglobin, alkaline phosphatase, and subsequent PSA and RECIST response. Median OS was 26 months for < five versus 13 months for ≥ five CTCs per 7.5 mL at day 0 (hazard ratio [HR], 2.74 [adjusting for covariates]). ROC curves had higher areas under the curve for day-0 CTCs than for PSA, and IDI analysis showed that adding day-0 CTCs to baseline PSA and other covariates increased predictive accuracy for survival by 8% to 10%. Regression trees yielded new prognostic subgroups, and rising CTC count from day 0 to 21 was associated with shorter OS (HR, 2.55).
CONCLUSION: These data validate the prognostic utility of CTC enumeration in a large docetaxel-based prospective cohort. Baseline CTC counts were prognostic, and rising CTCs at 3 weeks heralded significantly worse OS, potentially serving as an early metric to help redirect and optimize therapy in this clinical setting.",0,PRIMARY,Compare Progression-free Survival Between a Control or Standard Therapy Arm of Docetaxel + Placebo + Prednisone With Docetaxel + Atrasentan + Prednisone in Patients With Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer.,"Measured from date of registration to date of first observation of progressive disease, or death due to any cause.

This single-center, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized (1:1) clinical trial was designed to assess the effect on patient outcome of vitamin D supplementation in neurocritical care patients with hypovitaminosis D.
METHODS: From October 2016 until April 2018, emergently admitted neurocritical care patients with vitamin D deficiency (≤ 20 ng/ml) were randomized to receive vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, 540,000 IU) (n = 134) or placebo (n = 133). Hospital length of stay (LOS) was the primary outcome; secondary outcomes included intensive care unit (ICU) LOS, repeat vitamin D levels, patient complications, and patient disposition. Exploratory analysis evaluated specific subgroups of patients by LOS, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, and Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II).
RESULTS: Two-hundred seventy-four patients were randomized (intent-to-treat) and 267 were administered treatment within 48 hours of admission (as-treated; 61.2% of planned recruitment) and monitored. The mean age of as-treated patients was 54.0 ± 17.2 years (56.9% male, 77.2% white). After interim analysis suggested a low conditional power for outcome difference (predictive power 0.12), the trial was halted. For as-treated patients, no significant difference in hospital LOS (10.4 ± 14.5 days vs 9.1 ± 7.9 days, p = 0.4; mean difference 1.3, 95% CI -1.5 to 4.1) or ICU LOS (5.8 ± 7.5 days vs 5.4 ± 6.4 days, p = 0.4; mean difference 0.4, 95% CI -1.3 to 2.1) was seen between vitamin D3 and placebo groups, respectively.

Pharmacological blockade of TLR4 signaling in vivo potentiated acute intrathecal morphine analgesia, attenuated development of analgesic tolerance, hyperalgesia, and opioid withdrawal behaviors. TLR4 opposition to opioid actions was supported by morphine treatment of TLR4 knockout mice, which revealed a significant threefold leftward shift in the analgesia dose response function, versus wildtype mice. A range of structurally diverse clinically-employed opioid analgesics was found to be capable of activating TLR4 signaling in vitro. Selectivity in the response was identified since morphine-3-glucuronide, a morphine metabolite with no opioid receptor activity, displayed significant TLR4 activity, whilst the opioid receptor active metabolite, morphine-6-glucuronide, was devoid of such properties. In silico docking simulations revealed ligands bound preferentially to the LPS binding pocket of MD-2 rather than TLR4. An in silico to in vitro prediction model was built and tested with substantial accuracy. These data provide evidence that select opioids may non-stereoselectively influence TLR4 signaling and have behavioral consequences resulting, in part, via TLR4 signaling.",2,PRIMARY,Mean of the Change in Morphine Dosage (in mg) Required to Achieve 25% Reduction in Thermal Evoked Pain Responses Relative to Baseline (Pre-intervention) Placebo Condition Responses,"At a laboratory testing day pre and post intervention each participant received morphine sulphate (0.3mg/kg in 20ml saline vehicle initially, followed by 3 incremental doses of 0.02 mg/kg each with testing for thermal evoked pain response.

Toward Your Goals is superior to Arm 2: Receiving Enhanced Usual Care in terms of Weight Change (kg) 6 Months,25134692,Technology-assisted weight loss interventions in primary care: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for and treating obesity. However, there are many barriers to successfully treating obesity in primary care (PC). Technology-assisted weight loss interventions offer novel ways of improving treatment, but trials are overwhelmingly conducted outside of PC and may not translate well into this setting. We conducted a systematic review of technology-assisted weight loss interventions specifically tested in PC settings.
METHODS: We searched the literature from January 2000 to March 2014.
INCLUSION CRITERIA: (1) Randomized controlled trial; (2) trials that utilized the Internet, personal computer, and/or mobile device; and (3) occurred in an ambulatory PC setting. We applied the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care (EPOC) and Delphi criteria to assess bias and the Pragmatic-Explanatory Continuum Indicator Summary (PRECIS) criteria to assess pragmatism (whether trials occurred in the real world versus under ideal circumstances). Given heterogeneity, results were not pooled quantitatively.
RESULTS: Sixteen trials met inclusion criteria. Twelve (75 %) interventions achieved weight loss (range: 0.08 kg - 5.4 kg) compared to controls, while 5-45 % of patients lost at least 5 % of baseline weight. Trial duration and attrition ranged from 3-36 months and 6-80 %, respectively. Ten (63 %) studies reported results after at least 1 year of follow-up. Interventions used various forms of personnel, technology modalities, and behavior change elements; trials most frequently utilized medical doctors (MDs) (44 %), web-based applications (63 %), and self-monitoring (81 %), respectively. Interventions that included clinician-guiding software or feedback from personnel appeared to promote more weight loss than fully automated interventions. Only two (13 %) studies used publically available technologies. Many studies had fair pragmatism scores (mean: 2.8/4), despite occurring in primary care.
DISCUSSION: Compared to usual care, technology-assisted interventions in the PC setting help patients achieve weight loss, offering evidence-based options to PC providers. However, best practices remain undetermined. Despite occurring in PC, studies often fall short in utilizing pragmatic methodology and rarely provide publically available technology. Longitudinal, pragmatic, interdisciplinary, and open-source interventions are needed.",2,PRIMARY,Weight Change (kg),"Change in weight from baseline to 6-months.

Time points of measurement: 72 hours after ROSC.,25238742,Admission interleukin-6 is associated with post resuscitation organ dysfunction and predicts long-term neurological outcome after out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation.,"AIM OF THE STUDY: To study plasma concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and S-100B during intensive care after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest from ventricular fibrillation (OHCA-VF), and their associations with the duration of ischemia, organ dysfunction and long-term neurological outcome.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 12-month prospective observational multicentre study was conducted in 21 Finnish intensive care units in 2011. IL-6, hs-CRP and S-100B were measured at 0-6 h, 24 h, 48 h and 96 h after ICU admission. Associations with the time to return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores divided into tertiles and 12-month cerebral performance category (CPC) were tested.
RESULTS: Of 186 OHCA-VF patients included in the study, 110 (59.1%) patients survived with good neurological outcome (CPC 1-2) 12 months after cardiac arrest. Admission plasma concentrations of IL-6 but not hs-CRP were higher with prolonged time to ROSC (p<0.001, 0.203, respectively), in patients with subsequent higher SOFA scores (p<0.001, 0.069) and poor long-term neurological outcome (CPC 3-5) (p<0.001, 0.315). S-100B concentrations over time were higher in patients with CPC of 3-5 (p<0.001). The area under the curve for prediction of poor 12-month outcome for admission levels was 0.711 IL-6, 0.663 for S-100B and 0.534 for hs-CRP. With multivariate logistic regression analysis only admission IL-6 (p=0.046, OR 1.006, 95% CI 1.000-1.011/ng/L) was an independent predictor of poor neurological outcome.
CONCLUSION: Admission high IL-6, but not hs-CRP or S-100B, is associated with extra-cerebral organ dysfunction and along with age and time to ROSC are independent predictors for 12-month poor neurologic outcome (CPC 3-5).",2,PRIMARY,Early Postresuscitation Arterial Blood Pressure (mmHg) Measured Through Institution of Invasive Intra-arterial Pressure Monitoring.,"Results on postresuscitation, mean arterial blood pressure (mmHg) are provided for the fifth, pre-specified time point of measurement, i.e. at 72 hours after ROSC.",Steroids Group,Control Group,"Intervention: Stress-dose Steroids.

Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients exposed to conditions of chronic stress show activation of a conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA) gene expression profile, which in turn is associated with increased relapse and decreased disease-free survival. We conducted a randomized controlled phase 2 biomarker trial testing the impact of the nonselective β-antagonist propranolol on CTRA-related gene expression of 25 individuals receiving an autologous HCT for multiple myeloma. Propranolol was administered for 1 week prior to and 4 weeks following HCT. Blood was collected at baseline, day -2, and day +28. Intention-to-treat analyses controlling for demographic characteristics, high-risk disease (International Myeloma Working Group risk score), and tumor stage tested effects on a 53-gene CTRA indicator profile and measures of CTRA-related cellular processes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Twelve participants were randomized to the intervention and 13 to the control. Relative to the control group, propranolol-treated patients showed greater decreases from baseline to HCT day -2 and day +28 for both CTRA gene expression (P = .017) and bioinformatic measures of CD16- classical monocyte activation (P = .005). Propranolol-treated patients also showed relative upregulation of CD34+ cell-associated gene transcripts (P = .011) and relative downregulation of myeloid progenitor-containing CD33+ cell-associated gene transcripts (P = .001). Ancillary analyses identified nonsignificant trends toward accelerated engraftment and reduced posttransplant infections in propranolol-treated patients.

Seventy-one percent of those prenatally assessed were later reassessed at 3 months postpartum. Both mothers and fathers contributed reports of coparenting, father engagement, physical and psychological intimate partner violence (IPV), and depressive symptoms. Intent-to-treat analyses indicated: (a) some evidence that mothers in the intervention group reported more positive coparenting communication at 3 months postpartum than did control group mothers; (b) mothers in the intervention group reported significantly more time spent by fathers with the child than did control group mothers; (c) parents in the intervention group had significant reductions in psychological IPV compared to parents in the control group; and (d) both mothers and fathers showed reductions in self-reported depression over time, with no differential impact of group.

We aimed to examine associations of quantitative gastrointestinal and psychological traits with obesity, and to validate the ability of these traits to predict responses of obese individuals to pharmacotherapy.
METHODS: In a prospective study, we measured gastric emptying of solids and liquids, fasting and postprandial gastric volume, satiation by nutrient drink test (volume to fullness and maximal tolerated volume), satiety after an ad libitum buffet meal, gastrointestinal hormones, and psychological traits in 328 normal-weight, overweight, or obese adults. We also analyzed data from 181 previously studied adults to assess associations betwecen a subset of traits with body mass index and waist circumference. Latent dimensions associated with overweight or obesity were appraised by principal component analyses. We performed a proof of concept, placebo-controlled trial of extended-release phentermine and topiramate in 24 patients to validate associations between quantitative traits and response to weight-loss therapy.
RESULTS: In the prospective study, obesity was associated with fasting gastric volume (P = .03), accelerated gastric emptying (P < .001 for solids and P = .011 for liquids), lower postprandial levels of peptide tyrosine tyrosine (P = .003), and higher postprandial levels of glucagon-like peptide 1 (P < .001). In a combined analysis of data from all studies, obesity was associated with higher volume to fullness (n = 509; P = .038) and satiety with abnormal waist circumference (n = 271; P = .016). Principal component analysis identified latent dimensions that accounted for approximately 81% of the variation among overweight and obese subjects, including satiety or satiation (21%), gastric motility (14%), psychological factors (13%), and gastric sensorimotor factors (11%). The combination of phentermine and topiramate caused significant weight loss, slowed gastric emptying, and decreased calorie intake; weight loss in response to phentermine and topiramate was significantly associated with calorie intake at the prior satiety test.

The adverse events are preceded by acute worsening of oral glucose tolerance (oGTT) along with reduced plasma free fatty acids (FFA) and leptin in animal models. It is unclear whether the same acute effects occur in humans.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial was conducted to examine the potential metabolic effects of olanzapine in healthy volunteers. Participants included male (8) and female (7) subjects [18-30 years old, BMI 18.5-25]. Subjects received placebo or olanzapine (10 mg/day) for three days prior to oGTT testing. Primary endpoints included measurement of plasma leptin, oral glucose tolerance, and plasma free fatty acids (FFA). Secondary metabolic endpoints included: triglycerides, total cholesterol, high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, heart rate, blood pressure, body weight and BMI. Olanzapine increased glucose Area Under the Curve (AUC) by 42% (2808±474 vs. 3984±444 mg/dl·min; P = 0.0105) during an oGTT. Fasting plasma leptin and triglycerides were elevated 24% (Leptin: 6.8±1.3 vs. 8.4±1.7 ng/ml; P = 0.0203) and 22% (Triglycerides: 88.9±10.1 vs. 108.2±11.6 mg/dl; P = 0.0170), whereas FFA and HDL declined by 32% (FFA: 0.38±0.06 vs. 0.26±0.04 mM; P = 0.0166) and 11% (54.2±4.7 vs. 48.9±4.3 mg/dl; P = 0.0184), respectively after olanzapine. Other measures were unchanged.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Olanzapine exerts some but not all of the early endocrine/metabolic changes observed in rodent models of the metabolic side effects, and this suggest that antipsychotic effects are not limited to perturbations in glucose metabolism alone. Future prospective clinical studies should focus on identifying which reliable metabolic alterations might be useful as potential screening tools in assessing patient susceptibility to weight gain and diabetes caused by atypical antipsychotics.

The stressor leads to a physiological response of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) and the autonomous nervous system (ANS). Common biomarkers are cortisol levels and heart rate. In addition to the physiological stress response, the TSST also triggers a psychological response such as an increase in perceived stress, anxiety and emotional insecurity. Whereas HPA and ANS measures can easily be obtained for the TSST period itself, psychological measures are usually determined prior to (baseline) and after the TSST. This may exclude information of the stressful event itself. In the present study, we assessed perceived stress, anxiety and emotional insecurity before, during and after the TSST using visual analogue scales. In addition, cortisol levels and heart rates were assessed. Data of 260 healthy non-smoking males aged 16-60 yrs were used for analyses. Our results show that stress perception, anxiety and emotional insecurity were significantly higher during the TSST as compared to post-TSST ratings. Furthermore, our results suggest a covariance of the psychological stress response during the TSST and the physiological stress responses (cortisol and heart rate) for stress perception though the explained variance was small. This observation was not found for pre- and post-TSST ratings suggesting that assessing psychological stress measures during the stressor itself present a more informative measure of the stress response.",2,PRIMARY,Acute Stress Measured by Tension,"Tension and nervousness were self-assessed by the participants on a 0 to 100 millimeter (mm) Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) before and after a stress test.

METHODS: We randomly assigned 2499 HIV-seronegative men or transgender women who have sex with men to receive a combination of two oral antiretroviral drugs, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC-TDF), or placebo once daily. All subjects received HIV testing, risk-reduction counseling, condoms, and management of sexually transmitted infections.
RESULTS: The study subjects were followed for 3324 person-years (median, 1.2 years; maximum, 2.8 years). Of these subjects, 10 were found to have been infected with HIV at enrollment, and 100 became infected during follow-up (36 in the FTC-TDF group and 64 in the placebo group), indicating a 44% reduction in the incidence of HIV (95% confidence interval, 15 to 63; P=0.005).

The underlying mechanism(s) may involve chronic low-grade systemic inflammation and immune cell activation. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (sitagliptin) improve glucose tolerance and may possess immunomodulatory effects because leukocyte CD26 cell surface receptors express dipeptidyl peptidase-4 activity.
OBJECTIVE: Sitagliptin will reduce inflammatory and immune cell activation markers known to be elevated in cART-treated HIV-infected (HIV+) adults with impaired glucose tolerance.
DESIGN: This was designed as a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of sitagliptin in HIV+ adults.
SETTING: The setting was an academic medical center.
PATIENTS: Patients were cART-treated HIV+ men and women (n = 36) with stable HIV disease and impaired glucose tolerance.
INTERVENTIONS: Interventions included sitagliptin 100 mg/d or placebo for 8 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: At baseline and week 8, plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and C-X-C motif chemokine 10 concentrations (ELISA), oral glucose tolerance, and abdominal sc adipose mRNA expression for M1 macrophage markers (monocyte chemotactic protein-1, EGF-like module-containing, mucin-like hormone receptor 1).
RESULTS: Sitagliptin reduced glucose area under the curve (P = .002) and improved oral glucose insulin sensitivity index (P = .04) more than placebo. Sitagliptin reduced plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and C-X-C motif chemokine 10 levels more than placebo (P < .009). Adipose tissue monocyte chemotactic protein-1 mRNA abundance declined significantly more (P = .01), and adipose EGF-like module-containing, mucin-like hormone receptor 1 mRNA expression tended to decline more (P = .19) in sitagliptin than placebo.

This trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of panitumumab plus fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) compared with FOLFIRI alone after failure of initial treatment for mCRC by tumor KRAS status.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with mCRC, one prior chemotherapy regimen for mCRC, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2, and available tumor tissue for biomarker testing were randomly assigned 1:1 to panitumumab 6.0 mg/kg plus FOLFIRI versus FOLFIRI every 2 weeks. The coprimary end points of PFS and overall survival (OS) were independently tested and prospectively analyzed by KRAS status.
RESULTS: From June 2006 to March 2008, 1,186 patients were randomly assigned 1:1 and received treatment. KRAS status was available for 91% of patients: 597 (55%) with wild-type (WT) KRAS tumors, and 486 (45%) with mutant (MT) KRAS tumors. In the WT KRAS subpopulation, when panitumumab was added to chemotherapy, a significant improvement in PFS was observed (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.90; P = .004); median PFS was 5.9 months for panitumumab-FOLFIRI versus 3.9 months for FOLFIRI. A nonsignificant trend toward increased OS was observed; median OS was 14.5 months versus 12.5 months, respectively (HR = 0.85, 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.04; P = .12); response rate was improved to 35% versus 10% with the addition of panitumumab. In patients with MT KRAS, there was no difference in efficacy. Adverse event rates were generally comparable across arms with the exception of known toxicities associated with anti-EGFR therapy.

METHODS: Two online surveys were disseminated to patients and health professionals, in their native language, through national patient organizations and national rheumatology medical societies, respectively. SurveyMonkey®, MediGuard.org and the Glucocorticoid Low-dose Outcome in RA Study (GLORIA) website were used to offer and deliver these surveys.
RESULTS: A total of 1221 RA patients with exposure to GCs, and 414 rheumatologists completed the surveys. Patients and rheumatologists reported high levels of agreement regarding the efficacy of low-dose GCs: at least 70% considered that they are very rapid and effective in the control of signs and symptoms of RA. However, half of the patients also reported having suffered serious adverse events with GCs, and 83% described concerns about safety. The majority of rheumatologists estimated that endocrine, ophthalmologic and cutaneous adverse events affect >4% of all patients treated with low-dose GCs for 2 years, based on a heat map.
CONCLUSIONS: RA patients with self-reported exposure to GCs express high levels of satisfaction with low-dose GCs efficacy, as do rheumatologists. However, both expressed excessive concerns regarding the safety of GCs (greatly exceeding the published evidence data), which may compromise the optimal use of this medication.

We examined the preliminary efficacy and safety of chamomile for improving subjective sleep and daytime symptoms in patients with chronic insomnia.
METHODS: We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial in 34 patients aged 18-65 years with DSM-IV primary insomnia for ≥ 6-months. Patients were randomized to 270 mg of chamomile twice daily or placebo for 28-days. The primary outcomes were sleep diary measures.

RESULTS: There were no significant differences between groups in changes in sleep diary measures, including total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency, sleep latency, wake after sleep onset (WASO), sleep quality, and number of awakenings. Chamomile did show modest advantage on daytime functioning, although these did not reach statistical significance. Effect sizes were generally small to moderate (Cohen's d ≤ 0.20 to < 0.60) with sleep latency, night time awakenings, and Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), having moderate effect sizes in favor of chamomile. However, TST demonstrated a moderate effect size in favor of placebo. There were no differences in adverse events reported by the chamomile group compared to placebo.

Although postoperative mediastinitis cannot be reliably predicted, a number of preoperative and intraoperative risk factors have been defined by previous work. The authors now present their cumulative experience with primary sternal fixation of high-risk patients as one preventative measure.
METHODS: A retrospective review from July of 2000 to October of 2006 was performed on 750 patients who had at least three established risk factors for postoperative mediastinitis and received primary titanium plate sternal fixation. Patients were followed for a minimum of 6 weeks and monitored for pain, instability, wound breakdown, and plate migration.
RESULTS: Rigid plate fixation was completed at the end of the primary cardiac surgical procedure in all 750 patients. Sternal dehiscence occurred in 18 patients (2.4 percent), necessitating reexploration. Four of these patients developed postoperative mediastinitis and had other significant comorbidities, such as ongoing inflammatory breast cancer or pneumonia, that were beyond the typical risk factors identified for developing mediastinitis. Successful sternal fixation was therefore accomplished in 732 patients (97.6 percent). Despite changes in instrumentation and technique, this approach was adopted by the cardiac surgical team consistently after an initial mentoring and training period by the plastic surgeons.
CONCLUSIONS: Primary sternal fixation is a simple and reliable method for prevention of postoperative mediastinitis development in high-risk patients. This technique, conceptualized by plastic surgeons, is now being implemented by cardiac surgeons in increasing numbers. This demonstrates the ability for plastic surgery to initiate a paradigm shift in other fields of medicine and to decrease the complications that primarily affect our practice.",2,PRIMARY,"Sternal Healing Score at 6 Month Post op, as Defined by a 6-point Scale to Evaluate Bone Healing","Parameters for scoring:

The Panitumumab Randomized Trial in Combination With Chemotherapy for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer to Determine Efficacy (PRIME) was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of panitumumab plus infusional fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX4) versus FOLFOX4 alone as initial treatment for mCRC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this multicenter, phase III trial, patients with no prior chemotherapy for mCRC, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2, and available tissue for biomarker testing were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive panitumumab-FOLFOX4 versus FOLFOX4. The primary end point was PFS; overall survival (OS) was a secondary end point. Results were prospectively analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis by tumor KRAS status.
RESULTS: KRAS results were available for 93% of the 1,183 patients randomly assigned. In the wild-type (WT) KRAS stratum, panitumumab-FOLFOX4 significantly improved PFS compared with FOLFOX4 (median PFS, 9.6 v 8.0 months, respectively; hazard ratio [HR], 0.80; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.97; P = .02).

METHODS: All heart-eligible donors managed at a single OPO underwent standardized fluid resuscitation. If not weaned off vasopressors, donors underwent echocardiography (within 12 hours of BD) and were randomized to T3 or T4 infusion for eight hours.
RESULTS: A total of 37 BD donors were randomized (16 T3 vs 21 T4).

We have previously shown that a single dose of ketamine, a glutamate N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, is associated with a rapid reduction in depressive symptom severity and SI in patients with treatment-resistant depression.
METHOD: We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of ketamine in patients with mood and anxiety spectrum disorders who presented with clinically significant SI (n = 24). Patients received a single infusion of ketamine or midazolam (as an active placebo) in addition to standard of care. SI measured using the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (BSI) 24 h post-treatment represented the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale--Suicidal Ideation (MADRS-SI) score at 24 h and additional measures beyond the 24-h time-point.
RESULTS: The intervention was well tolerated and no dropouts occurred during the primary 7-day assessment period. BSI score was not different between the treatment groups at 24 h (p = 0.32); however, a significant difference emerged at 48 h (p = 0.047). MADRS-SI score was lower in the ketamine group compared to midazolam group at 24 h (p = 0.05). The treatment effect was no longer significant at the end of the 7-day assessment period.

METHODS: Adult patients initiating ART in a public clinic in Cape Town, South Africa, were randomized to treatment-supporter DOT-ART or self-administered ART. DOT-ART patients and supporters received baseline and follow-up training and monitoring. The primary endpoints were the proportions of patients with HIV viral load less than 400 copies/ml and change in CD4 cell counts at 12 and 24 months.
RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy-four patients enrolled (137 in each arm) and baseline characteristics were similar for both arms. The study was stopped early for futility by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board. In an intention-to-treat analysis, the proportions of patients with viral load less than 400 copies/ml at 12 months were 72.8% in the DOT-ART arm and 68.4% in the Self-ART arm (P = 0.42). DOT-ART patients had greater median CD4 cell count (cells/microl) increases at 6 months [148 (IQR 84-222) vs. 111 (IQR 44-196) P = 0.02] but similar results at all other time-points.

METHODS: PuLsE (Open Prospective Randomized Long-term Effectiveness) was a prospective, randomized, parallel-group, open-label, and long-term effectiveness study (conducted at 28 sites in Europe and Canada). Adults with pharmacoresistant focal seizures (n = 112) received VNS + BMP or BMP (1:1 ratio). Medications and VNS parameters could be adjusted as clinically indicated for optimal seizure control while minimizing adverse effects. Primary endpoint was mean change from baseline HRQoL (using Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory-89 total score; QOLIE-89). Secondary endpoints included changes in seizure frequency, responder rate (≥50% decrease in seizure frequency), Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D), Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory-Epilepsy scale (NDDI-E), Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale (CGI-I), Adverse Event Profile (AEP), and antiepileptic drug (AED) load. The study was prematurely terminated due to recruitment difficulties prior to completing the planned enrollment of n = 362. Results for n = 96 who had baseline and at least one follow-up QOLIE-89 assessment (from months 3-12) were included in this analysis. Mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis of variance was performed on change from baseline for the primary and secondary endpoints.
RESULTS: Significant between-group differences in favor of VNS + BMP were observed regarding improvement in HRQoL, seizure frequency, and CGI-I score (respective p-values < 0.05, 0.03, and 0.01). More patients in the VNS + BMP group (43%) reported adverse events (AEs) versus BMP group (21%) (p = 0.01), a difference reflecting primarily mostly transient AEs related to VNS implantation or stimulation.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the efficacy and safety of timothy grass AIT treatment in North American children/adolescents with grass pollen-induced allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (ARC) with or without asthma.
METHODS: Three hundred forty-five subjects (5-17 years old) were randomized to once-daily grass AIT treatment (2,800 bioequivalent allergen units, 75,000 standardized quality tablet, approximately 15 μg of Phl p 5) or placebo approximately 16 weeks before the 2009 grass pollen season (GPS). Treatment continued through the GPS. Daily symptoms and allergy rescue medication use were recorded. The primary end point was the total combined score (TCS) of the daily symptom score (DSS) and daily medication score (DMS) for the entire GPS. DSS, DMS, Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire score, and Phl p 5-specific IgG4 and IgE-blocking factor levels were secondary end points. Safety was assessed through adverse events.
RESULTS: Eighty-nine percent of subjects were multisensitized. TCS, DSS, DMS, and Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire score versus placebo improved 26% (P = .001), 25% (P = .005), 81% (P = .006), and 18% (P = .04). Phl p 5-specific IgG4 and IgE-blocking factor levels were significantly higher at the peak and end of the GPS (P < .001). Treatment was well tolerated. Adverse events were generally mild and transient. Although no investigator-assessed systemic allergic reactions were reported, 1 grass AIT-treated subject experienced an event indicating a systemic reaction (lip angioedema, dysphagia, and cough).
CONCLUSIONS: Use of once-daily timothy grass AIT treatment effectively treats timothy grass (cross-reactive with Festucoideae grasses) pollen-induced ARC in North American children 5 years and older.

Therefore, we tested a peer-led hypertension self-management intervention delivered at regular meetings of community veterans' organizations.
METHODS: We randomized 58 organizational units (""posts"") of veterans' organizations in southeast Wisconsin to peer-led vs. professionally delivered self-management education. Volunteer peer leaders at peer-led posts delivered monthly presentations regarding hypertension self-management during regular post meetings. Volunteer post representatives at seminar posts encouraged post members to attend 3 didactic seminars delivered by health professionals at a time separate from the post meeting. Volunteers in both groups encouraged members to self-monitor using blood pressure cuffs, weight scales, and pedometers. Our primary outcome was change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) at 12 months.
RESULTS: We measured SBP in 404 participants at baseline and in 379 participants at 12 months. SBP decreased significantly (4.4mm Hg; P < 0.0001) overall; the decrease was similar in peer-led and seminar posts (3.5mm Hg vs. 5.4mm Hg; P = 0.24). Among participants with uncontrolled BP at baseline, SBP decreased by 10.1mm Hg from baseline to 12 months but was again similar in the 2 groups. This pattern was also seen at 6 months and with diastolic blood pressure.
CONCLUSIONS: Our peer-led educational intervention was not more effective than didactic seminars for SBP control. Although peer-led educational programs have had important impacts in a number of studies, we did not find our intervention superior to a similar intervention delivered by healthcare professionals.

Increasing adherence to follow-up care has been a priority in the ED to improve patient outcomes and reduce unnecessary future visits.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective randomized open, blinded end-point (PROBE) trial of 278 adult patients discharged from the ED and referred to a provider for follow-up care. Participants in the intervention arm received a self-scheduling text or phone message that automatically connected them to their referral provider to schedule a follow-up appointment and sent them appointment reminders. Those in the control arm received standard-of-care written instructions to contact listed referral providers. The primary outcome was time to appointment. The secondary outcome was time to return visit to the ED.
RESULTS: The automated reminders increased the cumulative incidence of keeping the referral appointment after ED discharge (p < 0.001, Gray's test). Of participants randomized to the automated phone intervention, 49.3% (n = 74) kept their follow-up appointment versus 23.4% (n = 30) in the control arm, with a hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) over the duration of the study period of 2.4 (1.6 to 3.7; p < 0.001).

Hp phenotype was determined in the study prediction cohort (n = 2,393) and a case-control cohort (703 cases, 1,406 controls). The primary outcome was severe PAH, or mild or severe PAH with elevated liver enzymes, elevated serum creatinine, thrombocytopenia, eclampsia, fetal growth restriction, medically indicated preterm birth or perinatal death. Preeclampsia was a secondary outcome. Odds ratios were estimated by logistic regression. Sampling weights were used to reduce bias from an overrepresentation of women with preeclampsia or the primary outcome. There was no relationship between Hp phenotype and the primary outcome or preeclampsia in Hispanic, white/other or black women. Vitamin supplementation did not reduce the risk of the primary outcome or preeclampsia in women of any phenotype. Supplementation increased preeclampsia risk (odds ratio 3.30; 95% confidence interval 1.61-6.82, p<0.01) in Hispanic Hp 2-2 women.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers an evidence-based behavioral weight management intervention called MOVE!, mostly delivered through in-person group sessions. Few eligible Veterans participate due to factors like distance and preferences, mirroring barriers in the general population. Practical alternatives to standard in-person programs are needed to improve access and engagement. A self-directed lifestyle intervention called D-ELITE-delivered through pre-recorded videos by DVD or online streaming-previously efficacious in a general primary care population, may provide such an alternative. This pragmatic clinical trial will evaluate whether D-ELITE improves weight and general health status among Veterans with obesity, relative to VA usual care. The yearlong intervention includes one orientation by phone, supplemental lifestyle coaching primarily via technology-based messages, 12 DVD or online streaming sessions over 3 months, and continued self-directed weight management for months 4-12. Participants use MyFitnessPal.com or paper booklets for self-monitoring weight, diet, and physical activity. Follow-up assessments at 12 and 24 months are administered by mail or phone. The study hypothesis is that compared with usual care, D-ELITE will lead to greater improvements in 12-month weight loss, per VA electronic health records, and general physical health status, assessed using the self-reported SF-12 physical composite score. We will also explore D-ELITE's effects on secondary biometric (e.g., HbA1c) and intermediate (e.g., diet) outcomes, reach, and budget impact.

Based on such data, a multicenter double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of lamotrigine on pain and other neuropathic symptoms due to chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN).
METHODS: Patients with symptomatic CIPN with symptom scores of either 1) >3 on a 0-10 Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) or 2) >1 on the 0-3 the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) neuropathy scale (ENS) were eligible (higher numbers corresponding to greater severity of symptoms in both scales). Patients were randomly assigned to receive lamotrigine (target dose of 300 mg/day) or placebo for 10 weeks. Endpoints were measured biweekly.
RESULTS: In all, 131 patients were enrolled. Both groups were well matched at baseline. Over the 10-week period of the trial, the average pain scores (NRS) for the lamotrigine and placebo arms declined in both arms, with no statistically significant difference noted between the changes in the 2 groups (0.3 and 0.5 unit reduction from baseline, respectively; P=.56). Similarly, decreases in the ENS with therapy were not statistically different (0.4 and 0.3, respectively; P=.3).

METHODS: We conducted a clinic-randomized trial conducted from October 2006 to May 2007 in Minnesota. Included were 11 clinics with 41 consenting primary care physicians and the physicians' 2,556 patients with diabetes. Patients were randomized either to receive or not to receive an electronic health record (EHR)-based clinical decision support system designed to improve care for those patients whose hemoglobin A(1c), blood pressure, or LDL cholesterol levels were higher than goal at any office visit. Analysis used general and generalized linear mixed models with repeated time measurements to accommodate the nested data structure.
RESULTS: The intervention group physicians used the EHR-based decision support system at 62.6% of all office visits made by adults with diabetes. The intervention group diabetes patients had significantly better hemoglobin A(1c) (intervention effect -0.26%; 95% confidence interval, -0.06% to -0.47%; P=.01), and better maintenance of systolic blood pressure control (80.2% vs 75.1%, P=.03) and borderline better maintenance of diastolic blood pressure control (85.6% vs 81.7%, P =.07), but not improved low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (P = .62) than patients of physicians randomized to the control arm of the study. Among intervention group physicians, 94% were satisfied or very satisfied with the intervention, and moderate use of the support system persisted for more than 1 year after feedback and incentives to encourage its use were discontinued.

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective data collected as part of a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial for the treatment of corticosteroid-responsive AIED with methotrexate.
SETTING: Tertiary referral centers.
PATIENTS: One hundred sixteen patients with rapidly progressive, bilateral sensorineural hearing loss.
INTERVENTION: All patients completed a 1-month course of prednisone (60 mg/d). In Phase 2, 67 patients with improvement in hearing underwent a monitored 18-week prednisone taper, resulting in 22 weeks of prednisone therapy at an average dose of 30 mg per day. Thirty-three patients were randomized to receive methotrexate in Phase 2. Thirty-four patients received prednisone and placebo.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Adverse events (AE) in patients treated with prednisone only.
RESULTS: Of 116 patients, 7 had to stop prednisone therapy during the 1-month challenge phase due to AE. Of 34 patients, 5 were unable to complete the full 22-week course of prednisone due to AE. The most common AE was hyperglycemia, which occurred in 17.6% of patients participating in Phase 2.

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of bronchoscopies performed over a 4-year period.
SETTING: A tertiary teaching hospital.
PATIENTS: One hundred seventy-seven patients with pulmonary nodules without endobronchial lesions who underwent bronchoscopy with brushing, washing, and transbronchial biopsy.
RESULTS: There were 151 malignant and 26 benign lesions. The diagnostic accuracy of bronchoscopy in malignant and benign lesions were 64% (97 of 151) and 35% (9 of 26), respectively. The yield of bronchoscopy was directly related to lesion size (p < 0.001, chi(2)). When lesions were grouped according to distance from the hilum, yields of bronchoscopy in central, intermediate, and peripherally located lesions were 82, 61, and 53%, respectively (p = 0.05, chi(2)). When we stratified distance from the hilum by lesion size, the difference in yield was not significant. However, lesions </= 2 cm had a diagnostic yield of 14% (2 of 14) when located in the peripheral third vs 31% (5 of 16) when located in the inner two thirds of the lung. There was a trend toward higher combined diagnostic yield in right middle and lingular lobes when compared to all other segments (p = 0.09, chi(2)).

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Participants (71 interns from Catharina Hospital Eindhoven, CHE, and 29 from University Medical Centre Groningen, UMCG) were randomized to carry out CUS in a patient after training on the UM (UM-trained, 50) or without training on UM (control, 50). The assessment of real-time performance consisted of scoring on a Global Rating Scale (GRS) by supervisors unaware of training status. Data were analysed using stepwise multiple linear regression. The effect size (ES) indication for correlations was used to interpret the magnitude of a standard regression coefficient (beta); an ES of 0.10, 0.30 and 0.50 were considered small, moderate and large, respectively. The study was approved by the Medical Review Ethics Committees of the participating hospitals.
RESULTS: Overall, the group that received training performed significantly better than the controls (P < or = 0.003, beta range 0.30-0.47). There was no effect of training for participants with a specific preference for a surgical speciality in two of five GRS scores. Participants from CHE obtained higher GRS 3 scores than those from UMCG. Significantly more UMCG trainees indicated having had stress than those from CHE (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that interns who had trained on UM outperformed controls for a CUS procedure in a patient.

We assessed the effects of lixisenatide, a glucagon-like peptide 1-receptor agonist, on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes who had had a recent acute coronary event.
METHODS: We randomly assigned patients with type 2 diabetes who had had a myocardial infarction or who had been hospitalized for unstable angina within the previous 180 days to receive lixisenatide or placebo in addition to locally determined standards of care. The trial was designed with adequate statistical power to assess whether lixisenatide was noninferior as well as superior to placebo, as defined by an upper boundary of the 95% confidence interval for the hazard ratio of less than 1.3 and 1.0, respectively, for the primary composite end point of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospitalization for unstable angina.
RESULTS: The 6068 patients who underwent randomization were followed for a median of 25 months. A primary end-point event occurred in 406 patients (13.4%) in the lixisenatide group and in 399 (13.2%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.89 to 1.17), which showed the noninferiority of lixisenatide to placebo (P<0.001) but did not show superiority (P=0.81). There were no significant between-group differences in the rate of hospitalization for heart failure (hazard ratio in the lixisenatide group, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.23) or the rate of death (hazard ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.13).

This study investigated whether cigarette demand predicted response to contingent monetary rewards for abstinence among individuals with substance use disorders. It also sought to replicate evidence for greater price sensitivity at whole-dollar pack price transitions (ie, left-digit effects).
METHODS: Participants (N = 338) were individuals in residential substance use disorder treatment who participated in a randomized controlled trial that compared contingent vouchers to noncontingent vouchers for smoking abstinence. Baseline demand indices were used to predict number of abstinent days during the 14-day voucher period (after the reduction lead-in) and at 1 and 3 months afterward.
RESULTS: Demand indices correlated with measures of smoking and nicotine dependence. As measured by elasticity, intensity and O max, higher demand significantly predicted fewer abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings during voucher period for individuals in the noncontingent vouchers condition. Breakpoint exhibited a trend-level association with abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings. Demand indices did not predict abstinence in the contingent vouchers group, and did not predict abstinence at 1- and 3-month follow-ups. Left-digit price transitions were associated with significantly greater reductions in consumption.
CONCLUSIONS: The association of cigarette demand with smoking behavior only in the group for whom abstinence was not incentivized indicates that CPT assesses the value of smoking more than the value of money per se and that vouchers counteract the effects of the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes. Results provide initial short-term evidence of predictive validity for the CPT indices.
IMPLICATIONS: This study provides the first evidence of the validity of the CPT for predicting early response to brief advice for smoking cessation plus nicotine replacement in smokers with substance dependence. However, demand for cigarettes did not predict voucher-based treatment response, indicating that incentives serve as a powerful motivator not to smoke that acts in opposition to the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes and that the indices reflect the value of smoking more than the value of money per se.",0,PRIMARY,Number of Participants With Relapse to Any Drug Use,No Description Available,Contingency Management (CM),Noncontingent Reinforcement (NR),"Condition provides contingent monetary reinforcement for smoking reductions (first 5 days) then for smoking abstinence (subsequent 14 days).

The purpose of this study was to analyze findings that were related to cases with a complicated/adverse neonatal outcome in the Swedish randomized controlled trial.
STUDY DESIGN: Of the 4966 term fetuses that were included in the trial, all 351 newborn infants who required special neonatal care were identified. Cases of perinatal death, neonatal encephalopathy, or metabolic acidosis at birth were reviewed.
RESULTS: Of the 29 fetuses with adverse/complicated neonatal outcome, 22 fetuses had cardiotocography and ST patterns that indicated a need for intervention, according to the cardiotocography plus ST clinical guidelines. The number of live-born with moderate or severe neonatal encephalopathy showed a significant decrease from 0.33% (8/2447 fetuses) in the cardiotocography-only group to 0.04% (1/2519 fetuses) in the cardiotocography plus ST group.

This updated efficacy and safety analysis from the phase 3 CANDOR study compared carfilzomib, daratumumab, and dexamethasone (KdD) with carfilzomib and dexamethasone (Kd) in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.
METHODS: In this updated analysis of the randomised, multicentre, open-label, phase 3 CANDOR study, patients (aged ≥18 years) with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, at least a partial response to between one and three previous therapies, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, were recruited from 102 medical centres globally and randomly assigned (2:1) by interactive voice or web response software to receive KdD or Kd. Participants were stratified by disease stage, previous proteasome inhibitor or anti-CD38 antibody exposure, and number of previous therapies. All patients received intravenous infusions of carfilzomib twice per week at 56 mg/m
FINDINGS: Between June 13, 2017, and June 25, 2018, 466 patients were enrolled, of whom 312 received KdD and 154 received Kd. At data cutoff (June 15, 2020), median follow-up was 27·8 months (IQR 25·6-29·5) for KdD and 27·0 months (13·2-28·6) for Kd. Median progression-free survival was 28·6 months (95% CI 22·7-not estimable [NE]) in the KdD group and 15·2 months (11·1-19·9) in the Kd group (hazard ratio 0·59 [95% CI 0·45-0·78], log-rank p<0·0001). Treatment-emergent adverse events in the safety population were consistent with the primary analysis. Grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 268 (87%) patients in the KdD group and 116 (76%) in the Kd group; most commonly thrombocytopenia (76 [25%] vs 25 [16%], respectively), hypertension (65 [21%] vs 23 [15%]), pneumonia (54 [18%] vs 14 [9%]), and anaemia (53 [17%] vs 23 [15%]). Serious adverse events occurred in 194 (63%) patients with KdD and 76 (50%) with Kd. Adverse events leading to death occurred in 27 (9%) patients in the KdD group and seven (5%) in the Kd group; most commonly septic shock (five [2%] vs one (1%]) and pneumonia (four [1%] vs none). No new treatment-related deaths have occurred since the primary analysis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) detectors were placed in four quadrants of the breast of a female-configured anthropomorphic phantom to determine radiation dose to the breast. Imaging was performed on a 16-MDCT scanner (LightSpeed, GE Healthcare) using current clinical protocols designed to assess pulmonary embolus (PE) (140 kVp, 380 mA, 0.8-sec rotation, 16 x 1.25 mm collimation), appendicitis (140 kVp, 340 mA, 0.5-sec rotation, 16 x 0.625 mm collimation), and renal calculus (140 kVp, 160 mA, 0.5-sec rotation, 16 x 0.625 mm collimation).
RESULTS: Radiation dose to the breast ranged from 4 to 6 cGy for the PE protocol and up to 1-2 cGy in the inferior aspect of the right breast and lateral aspect of the left breast for the appendicitis protocol. The renal calculus protocol yielded less than 150 microGy absorbed breast dose.

A follow-up trial is needed to confirm these promising results. The present study aims to investigate the effect of an occlusion stimulus on quadriceps atrophy after ACL reconstruction.
METHODS: A total of 24 subjects participated in the study. They were randomized into two groups. Starting the 2nd day after surgery, the occlusion group received an occlusion stimulus for 5 min, followed by removal of the occlusive pressure for 3 min. This was repeated five times in one training session, twice daily. During the period of occlusive stimulus, the subjects performed 20 low load exercises for the quadriceps. The control group followed the same exercise protocol, but without the occlusion stimulus. Changes in quadriceps anatomical cross section area (ACSA) were measured using axial magnetic resonance (MR) images at 40% and 50% of the length of the femur.
RESULTS: Both groups had a significant reduction of quadriceps ACSA from 2 days before surgery to 16 days after surgery. During the intervention period, the occlusion group lost 13.8% ± 1.1% (mean ± SEM) and the control group lost 13.1% ± 1.0% of their quadriceps ACSA, respectively. There was no significant difference between the occlusion and control groups with regards to atrophy of the quadriceps muscles.

STUDY DESIGN: Chronically instrumented, near-term fetal sheep received 1-minute total umbilical cord occlusion either every 5 minutes for 4 hours (1:5 group, n = 8), or every 2.5 minutes until blood pressure fell <20 mm Hg on 2 successive occlusions (1:2.5 group, n = 8).
RESULTS: Umbilical cord occlusion caused variable decelerations, with sustained hypertension in the 1:5 group and little change in acid-base status (pH = 7.34 +/- 0.07 after 4 hours). In contrast, the 1:2.5 group showed progressive hypotension and metabolic acidemia (pH 6.92 +/- 0.1 after the final occlusion). There was a marked increase in ST waveform height during occlusions; this increase was greater in the 1:2.5 group (P <.001), but there was overlap between the groups. ST waveform height between occlusions was significantly higher in the 1:2.5 group (P <.001) until negative and biphasic ST waveforms developed in these fetuses between occlusions in the final 30 minutes.

It is suggested that analysis of PISF may serve for detection of inflammation. The aim of this study is to analyze PISF interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), IL-10, osteoprotegerin (OPG), receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL) levels to determine whether the diagnostic value of PISF can be used to evaluate early changes around implants.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 47 dental implants either healthy/non-inflamed (n=20) (Group I), or gingivitis/inflamed (n=27) (Group II), were classified. Peri-implant status has been evaluated by clinical evaluation (plaque index, gingival index, probing depth and gingival bleeding time index) were recorded and PISF samples were also obtained. PISF IL-1β, IL-10, RANKL, and OPG levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Potential volumetric changes in PISF were also evaluated.
RESULTS: All clinical parameters and volume of PISF were higher in Group II and these differences were statistically significant except volume values. IL-1β, IL-10 and OPG levels in PISF were significantly higher in Group II. Although the PISF RANKL level in Group II was higher than the level of Group I, the difference between groups did not reach the statistically significant level.

We aimed to test the efficacy and safety of oral rivaroxaban for the prevention of venous thromboembolism after total knee arthroplasty.
METHODS: In a randomised, double-blind, phase III study, 3148 patients undergoing knee arthroplasty received either oral rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily, beginning 6-8 h after surgery, or subcutaneous enoxaparin 30 mg every 12 h, starting 12-24 h after surgery. Patients had mandatory bilateral venography between days 11 and 15. The primary efficacy outcome was the composite of any deep-vein thrombosis, non-fatal pulmonary embolism, or death from any cause up to day 17 after surgery. Efficacy was assessed as non-inferiority of rivaroxaban compared with enoxaparin in the per-protocol population (absolute non-inferiority limit -4%); if non-inferiority was shown, we assessed whether rivaroxaban had superior efficacy in the modified intention-to-treat population. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00362232.
FINDINGS: The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 67 (6.9%) of 965 patients given rivaroxaban and in 97 (10.1%) of 959 given enoxaparin (absolute risk reduction 3.19%, 95% CI 0.71-5.67; p=0.0118). Ten (0.7%) of 1526 patients given rivaroxaban and four (0.3%) of 1508 given enoxaparin had major bleeding (p=0.1096).
INTERPRETATION: Oral rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily for 10-14 days was significantly superior to subcutaneous enoxaparin 30 mg given every 12 h for the prevention of venous thromboembolism after total knee arthroplasty.

This is the first controlled investigation based on our review of the early use of a medication to prevent PTSD in children.
METHODS: Twenty-six children aged 6-20 were assessed in a 24-week double-blind placebo-controlled design. Each child received either flexibly dosed sertraline between 25-150 mg/day or placebo. At each reassessment, information was collected in compliance with the study medication, parental assessment of the child's symptomatology and functioning, and the child's self-report of symptomatology. The protocol was approved by the Human Studies Committees of Massachusetts General Hospital and Shriners Hospitals for Children.
RESULTS: The final sample was 17 subjects who received sertraline versus 9 placebo control subjects matched for age, severity of injury, and type of hospitalization. There was no significant difference in change from baseline with child-reported symptoms; however, the sertraline group demonstrated a greater decrease in parent-reported symptoms over 8 weeks (-4.1 vs. -0.5, p=0.005), over 12 weeks (-4.4 vs. -1.2, p=.008), and over 24 weeks (-4.0 vs. -0.2, p=0.017).

METHODS: We randomly assigned 2499 HIV-seronegative men or transgender women who have sex with men to receive a combination of two oral antiretroviral drugs, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC-TDF), or placebo once daily. All subjects received HIV testing, risk-reduction counseling, condoms, and management of sexually transmitted infections.
RESULTS: The study subjects were followed for 3324 person-years (median, 1.2 years; maximum, 2.8 years). Of these subjects, 10 were found to have been infected with HIV at enrollment, and 100 became infected during follow-up (36 in the FTC-TDF group and 64 in the placebo group), indicating a 44% reduction in the incidence of HIV (95% confidence interval, 15 to 63; P=0.005).

The main objectives of the present study were to determine which GT subtype is most affected in AD and to asses to what extent altered GT function is associated with abnormal amyloid precursor protein (APP) expression. While EAAT2-immunoreactivity (IR) was decreased in AD frontal cortex, EAAT1- and EAAT3-IR were unaffected; mRNA levels for all 3 GTs were not affected. Decreased EAAT2-IR was associated with decreased GT activity. EAAT2-IR inversely correlated with EAAT2 mRNA levels, suggesting that in AD, GT expression alterations occur due to disturbance at the post-transcriptional level. EAAT2-IR was inversely correlated with APP770 mRNA. In addition, GT activity directly correlated with APP695 mRNA and total APP protein levels, and inversely correlated with APP751/770 mRNA levels.

OBJECTIVE: We examined the effects of 2 treatment strategies on the progression of secondary hyperparathyroidism using measurements of the nonsuppressible component of calcium-regulated PTH secretion as an index of parathyroid mass.
DESIGN, SUBJECTS, AND INTERVENTION: In this randomized, open-label study, subjects managed with hemodialysis for >3 but <12 months before entering the trial (mean, 7.2 months) who had baseline plasma PTH levels >300 pg/mL received cinacalcet and low-dose vitamin D sterols (Cin-D, n = 153) or larger, varying doses of calcitriol, or other vitamin D analogs (Flex-D, n = 151). Study drug doses were adjusted periodically based on PTH and serum total calcium determinations.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The exploratory endpoint was calcium-regulated PTH release, assessed using a standardized PTH suppression test before and after 52 weeks of treatment and 4 weeks after withdrawing treatment. PTH and serum total calcium were measured before hemodialysis using high-calcium (3.5 mEq/L or 1.75 mmol/L) dialysate and after 150 and 180 minutes.
RESULTS: Mean (95% confidence interval) nonsuppressible calcium-regulated PTH release at baseline did not differ between Cin-D, 33.4% (25.9%, 40.9%), and Flex-D, 28.1% (23.2%, 32.9%).

The primary link between these two disciplinary approaches appears to be that the individualization process can be operationalized in terms of agency in identity formation. The relationship between agency and identity formation has been recognized by identity status researchers for some time, but primarily in terminology referring to the intrapsychic level; hence, in some respects, identity status researchers anticipated individualization theory. This link was empirically investigated in three studies of ethnically diverse samples. It was concluded, with a high degree of replication, that the identity statuses representing identity confusion (Diffusion) and identity synthesis (Achievement) appear to represent forms of default and developmental individualization, respectively.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of mometasone furoate nasal spray (NS) on nasal symptoms, nasal patency, sleep variables, quality of life, and daytime functioning in perennial AR (PAR) and concomitant RDS.
METHODS: In this double-blind 4-week study, 30 adults with PAR and moderate RDS were randomized 2:1 to receive mometasone furoate NS, 200 microg, or placebo each morning. The primary end point was the apnea-hypopnea index. Secondary outcome measures included changes in total nasal symptom score (TNSS), nighttime symptom score, daytime peak nasal inspiratory flow, nighttime flow limitation index, Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire-Standardized (RQLQ-S) score, Epworth Sleepiness Scale score, and Work Productivity and Activities Impairment-Allergy Specific (WPAI-AS) questionnaire score. Analysis of covariance was used for all efficacy end points.
RESULTS: The apnea-hypopnea index at study end was not statistically significantly different between groups.

METHODS: This is a randomized controlled trial performed at a single tertiary care hospital between March 2010 and November 2012. Women older than 18 years of age with a singleton pregnancy between 16 0/7 and 23 6/7 weeks of gestation undergoing an examination-indicated cerclage were eligible. Women were randomly assigned to receive either perioperative indomethacin and antibiotics or no perioperative prophylactic medications. The primary outcome was gestational latency after cerclage placement. Fifty women were required to be randomized to show, with 80% power, a 28-day improvement in latency assuming a latency without intervention of 50±35 days.
RESULTS: Fifty-three patients were enrolled with three lost to follow-up. A greater proportion of pregnancies were prolonged by at least 28 days among women who received indomethacin and perioperative antibiotics (24 [92.3%] compared with 15 [62.5%], P=.01). However, gestational age at delivery and neonatal outcomes were statistically similar between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Among women receiving an examination-indicated cerclage in the second trimester, gestation was significantly more likely to be prolonged by 28 days among women who received perioperative indomethacin and antibiotics.

METHODS: In a randomised, open-label study, 121 healthy women, 18-50 years of age, were randomly assigned to receive NOMAC/E2 (2.5 mg/1.5 mg) in a 24/4-day regimen (n=60) or LNG/EE (150 μg/30 μg) in a 21/7-day regimen (n=61) for six cycles. The primary outcome was the change from baseline to cycle 6 for all indices.
RESULTS: All parameters were similar at baseline between the two groups. Over six cycles, NOMAC/E2 had less effect on most haemostatic indices than LNG/EE. Lipids were essentially unchanged with NOMAC/E2, whereas with LNG/EE high-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides slightly increased. NOMAC/E2 induced negligible changes in glucose and insulin parameters, in contrast to LNG/EE. A much smaller increase in CRP was observed with NOMAC/E2 than with LNG/EE.

To support approval of omarigliptin in the United States, the clinical development program included a cardiovascular (CV) safety study. Subsequently, a business decision was made not to submit a marketing application for omarigliptin in the United States, and the CV safety study was terminated. Herein we report an analysis of data from that early-terminated study.
METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind study, 4202 patients with T2DM and established CV disease were assigned to either omarigliptin 25 mg q.w. or matching placebo in addition to their existing diabetes therapy. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to summarize the primary endpoint of time to first major adverse CV event (MACE, the composite of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke) and the analysis of first event of hospitalization for heart failure (hHF).
RESULTS: The median follow-up was approximately 96 weeks (range 1.1-178.6 weeks). The primary MACE outcome occurred in 114/2092 patients in the omarigliptin group (5.45%; 2.96/100 patient-years) and 114/2100 patients in the placebo group (5.43%; 2.97/100 patient-years), with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.00 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77, 1.29). The hHF outcome occurred in 20/2092 patients in the omarigliptin group (0.96%; 0.51/100 patient-years) and 33/2100 patients in the placebo group (1.57%; 0.85/100 patient-years), with an HR of 0.60 (95% CI 0.35, 1.05). After 142 weeks, the least-squares mean difference (omarigliptin vs. placebo) in glycated hemoglobin levels was -0.3% (95% CI -0.46, -0.14). The numbers of patients with adverse events, serious adverse events or discontinued from study medication due to adverse events were similar in the omarigliptin and placebo groups.
CONCLUSIONS: In this CV safety study of patients with T2DM and established CV disease, omarigliptin did not increase the risk of MACE or hHF and was generally well tolerated.

METHODS: 443 patients of the Veterans Health Administration diagnosed with a depressive disorder completed the Beck Depression Inventory, Interpersonal Support Evaluation List, and Beck Hopelessness Scale, from which we derived measures of burdensomeness, belongingness, and hopelessness consistent with the interpersonal theory of suicide. Measures of active and passive suicidal ideation were constructed from the Beck Suicide Scale and Beck Depression Inventory obtained at baseline and 3-months follow-up. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of passive and active suicidal ideation while adjusting for demographic characteristics and somatic-affective symptoms of depression (e.g., anhedonia, insomnia).
RESULTS: Burdensomeness and hopelessness were significantly associated with passive suicidal ideation at baseline and 3 months follow-up, but belongingness and the interaction between belongingness and burdensomeness were not significant predictors as proposed by the interpersonal theory of suicide. Somatic-affective depressive symptoms, but not any of the main effects predicted by the interpersonal theory of suicide or their interactions, were associated with active suicidal ideation at baseline. No factors were consistently associated with active suicidal ideation at 3 months follow-up.
LIMITATIONS: The measure of burdensomeness used in this study only partially represents the construct described by the interpersonal theory of suicide.
CONCLUSION: We found little support for the predictions of the interpersonal theory of suicide.

10604,NCT01075152,Earlier HIV Therapy is superior or other to Deferred HIV Therapy in terms of Mortality 26 weeks from study entry,24963568,Timing of antiretroviral therapy after diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis.,"BACKGROUND: Cryptococcal meningitis accounts for 20 to 25% of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related deaths in Africa. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is essential for survival; however, the question of when ART should be initiated after diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis remains unanswered.
METHODS: We assessed survival at 26 weeks among 177 human immunodeficiency virus-infected adults in Uganda and South Africa who had cryptococcal meningitis and had not previously received ART. We randomly assigned study participants to undergo either earlier ART initiation (1 to 2 weeks after diagnosis) or deferred ART initiation (5 weeks after diagnosis). Participants received amphotericin B (0.7 to 1.0 mg per kilogram of body weight per day) and fluconazole (800 mg per day) for 14 days, followed by consolidation therapy with fluconazole.
RESULTS: The 26-week mortality with earlier ART initiation was significantly higher than with deferred ART initiation (45% [40 of 88 patients] vs. 30% [27 of 89 patients]; hazard ratio for death, 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06 to 2.82; P=0.03). The excess deaths associated with earlier ART initiation occurred 2 to 5 weeks after diagnosis (P=0.007 for the comparison between groups); mortality was similar in the two groups thereafter. Among patients with few white cells in their cerebrospinal fluid (<5 per cubic millimeter) at randomization, mortality was particularly elevated with earlier ART as compared with deferred ART (hazard ratio, 3.87; 95% CI, 1.41 to 10.58; P=0.008). The incidence of recognized cryptococcal immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome did not differ significantly between the earlier-ART group and the deferred-ART group (20% and 13%, respectively; P=0.32). All other clinical, immunologic, virologic, and microbiologic outcomes, as well as adverse events, were similar between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Deferring ART for 5 weeks after the diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis was associated with significantly improved survival, as compared with initiating ART at 1 to 2 weeks, especially among patients with a paucity of white cells in cerebrospinal fluid.

This study aimed to determine the relationship among psychosocial factors, medical factors, and QoL in patients with ESRD undergoing hemodialysis (HD).
METHODS: In total, 55 male and 47 female patients were evaluated (mean age, 57.1 ± 12.0 years). The QoL was evaluated using the Korean version of World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale-Abbreviated Version. The psychosocial factors were evaluated using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and Zarit Burden Interview. The medical factors were assessed using laboratory examinations. Correlation and canonical correlation analyses were performed to investigate the association patterns.
RESULTS: The QoL was significantly correlated with the psychosocial factors, and to a lesser extent with the medical factors. The medical and psychosocial factors were also correlated. The canonical correlation analysis indicated a correlation between QoL and psychosocial factors (1st canonical correlation = 0.696, P < 0.001; 2nd canonical correlation = 0.421, P = 0.191), but not medical factors (1st canonical correlation = 0.478, P = 0.475; 2nd canonical correlation = 0.419, P = 0.751).

The authors explored the hypothesis that preoxygenation in the 25 degrees head-up position allows a greater safety margin for induction of anesthesia than the supine position.
METHODS: A randomized controlled trial measured oxygen saturation and the desaturation safety period after 3 min of preoxygenation in 42 consecutive (male:female 13:29) severely obese (body mass index > 40 kg/m) patients who were undergoing laparoscopic adjustable gastric band surgery and were randomly assigned to the supine position or the 25 degrees head-up position. Serial arterial blood gases were taken before and after preoxygenation and 90 s after induction. After induction, ventilation was delayed until blood oxygen saturation reached 92%, and this desaturation safety period was recorded.
RESULTS: The mean body mass indexes for the supine and 25 degrees head-up groups were 47.3 and 44.9 kg/m, respectively (P = 0.18). The group randomly assigned to the 25 degrees head-up position achieved higher preinduction oxygen tensions (442 +/- 104 vs. 360 +/- 99 mmHg; P = 0.012) and took longer to reach an oxygen saturation of 92% (201 +/- 55 vs. 155 +/- 69 s; P = 0.023). There was a strong positive correlation between the induction oxygen tension achieved and the time to reach an oxygen saturation of 92% (r = 0.51, P = 0.001). There were no adverse events associated with the study.
CONCLUSION: Preoxygenation in the 25 degrees head-up position achieves 23% higher oxygen tensions, allowing a clinically significant increase in the desaturation safety period--greater time for intubation and airway control.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence of various categories of ENT lesions and to determine whether preventive treatment with methylprednisolone (Mp) is useful in this indication. In a prospective trial, 236 patients who were undergoing anterior cervical spine surgery were separated into two groups, a control group (group I: 158 patients) and a group receiving 1 mg/kg of Mp intravenously at the end of the operation and 12 and 24 h later (group II: 78 patients). All 236 patients underwent nasofibroscopic examination by an ENT specialist the day before the operation and 24 and 36 h after the operation. The lesions observed during these examinations and reported symptoms such as uncomfortable sensation, odynophagia, or dysphagia were compared between the two groups (chi(2) or Mann-Whitney test) in terms of relative risk, with a confidence interval of 95%. Quantitative findings were compared using Student's t-test ( P<0.05). Demographic characteristics and duration of endotracheal intubation were comparable in the two groups. The ENT examination was considered abnormal in 30 patients of group I and 15 patients of group II preoperatively (NS). It was abnormal in 146 patients of group I (92%) and 46 patients of group II (59%) postoperatively. Altered vocal cord motility was noted in six patients of group I and two patients of group II. The relative risk was 1.6 (CI: 1.3-1.9). Postoperatively, 130 patients in group I and 56 of group II (NS) reported unwanted symptoms. The observed lesions were significantly more severe in group I ( P<0.001), involving primarily the pharyngeal wall, the arytenoids, and the vocal cords.

However, there is concern about potential sensory changes of the skin flaps after BABA, especially of the breast areas. This prospective study was undertaken to evaluate sensory changes in the skin flaps after BABA.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 19 women (mean age 36.9 ± 8.7; age range 21-51 years) who underwent BABA were enrolled. Skin flap sensory assessments were performed for each patient preoperatively and again at 1 and 3 months postoperatively. The Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test was used to evaluate the cutaneous light-pressure thresholds, a biothesiometer was used to evaluate the vibration thresholds, and an infrared thermometer was used to measure skin temperatures of the skin flaps.
RESULTS: There were changes in the sensations of the anterior chest areas over time, as determined by the Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test (1.5 vs 4.3 versus 1.4; P < 0.05) and the biothesiometer (26.8 vs 31.2 vs 22.3; P < 0.05). The sensations in the anterior chest areas normalized to preoperative levels at 3 months postoperatively. No significant differences were seen in the infrared thermometer test at any of the time points (36.2 vs 36.2 vs 36.3 °C; P = 0.9927).
CONCLUSIONS: While anterior chest area sensations were changed at 1 month postoperatively, the sensations normalized at 3 months after BABA.

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin in treatment-naive patients with type 2 diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a 24-week parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial. Patients with A1C 7.0-10% (n = 485) were randomly assigned to one of seven arms to receive once-daily placebo or 2.5, 5, or 10 mg dapagliflozin once daily in the morning (main cohort) or evening (exploratory cohort). Patients with A1C 10.1-12% (high-A1C exploratory cohort; n = 73) were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive blinded treatment with a morning dose of 5 or 10 mg/day dapagliflozin. The primary end point was change from baseline in A1C in the main cohort, statistically tested using an ANCOVA.
RESULTS: In the main cohort, mean A1C changes from baseline at week 24 were -0.23% with placebo and -0.58, -0.77 (P = 0.0005 vs. placebo), and -0.89% (P < 0.0001 vs. placebo) with 2.5, 5, and 10 mg dapagliflozin, respectively.

Although these naturally occurring peptides modulate pain, it is unknown whether endogenous opioids affect the perception of breathlessness associated with a specific respiratory challenge. The hypothesis is that intravenous administration of naloxone, used to block opioid signaling and inhibit neural pathways, will increase ratings of breathlessness during resistive load breathing (RLB) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
METHODS: Fourteen patients with COPD (age, 64 ± 9 years) inspired through resistances during practice sessions to identify an individualized target load that caused ratings of intensity and/or unpleasantness of breathlessness ≥ 50 mm on a 100 mm visual analog scale. At two intervention visits, serum beta-endorphins were measured, naloxone (10 mg/25 ml) or normal saline (25 ml) was administered intravenously, and patients rated the two dimensions of breathlessness each minute during RLB.
RESULTS: Patient ratings of intensity (p = 0.0004) and unpleasantness (p = 0.024) of breathlessness were higher with naloxone compared with normal saline. Eleven patients (79%) reported that it was easier to breathe during RLB with normal saline (p = 0.025). RLB led to significant increases in serum beta-endorphin immunoreactivity and decreases in inspiratory capacity. There were no significant differences in physiological responses between interventions.

BACKGROUND: Depression is common among HF patients. It is associated with increased hospitalization and mortality.
METHODS: The SADHART-CHF (Sertraline Against Depression and Heart Disease in Chronic Heart Failure) trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of sertraline 50 to 200 mg/day versus matching placebo for 12 weeks. All participants also received nurse-facilitated support. Eligible patients were age 45 years or older with HF (left ventricular ejection fraction < or =45%, New York Heart Association functional class II to IV) and clinical depression (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition criteria for current major depressive disorder). Those with significant cognitive impairment, psychosis, recent alcohol or drug dependence, bipolar or severe personality disorder, active suicidal ideation, and current antipsychotic or antidepressant medications were excluded. Primary end points were change in depression severity (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale total score) and composite cardiovascular status at 12 weeks.
RESULTS: A total of 469 patients were randomized (n = 234 sertraline, n = 235 placebo). The mean +/- SE change from baseline to 12 weeks in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale total score was -7.1 +/- 0.5 (sertraline) and -6.8 +/- 0.5 (placebo) (p < 0.001 from baseline, p = 0.89 between groups, mean change between groups -0.4; 95% confidence interval: -1.7 to 0.92).

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) uses an online weight management tool (MOVE!23) which is publicly available, but was not designed for use in non-VHA populations.
METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study to determine how interactions between the tool and other contextual elements impacted task performance when the target Latina users interacted with MOVE!23. We sought to identify and classify specific facilitators and barriers that might inform design changes to the tool and its context of use, and in turn promote usability. Six English-speaking, adult Latinas were recruited from an inner city primary care clinic and a nursing program at a local university in the United States to engage in a ""Think-Aloud"" protocol while using MOVE!23. Sessions were recorded, transcribed, and coded to identify interactions between four factors that contribute to usability (Tool, Task, User, Context).
RESULTS: Five themes influencing usability were identified: Technical Ability and Technology Preferences; Language Confusion and Ambiguity; Supportive Tool Design and Facilitator Guidance; Relevant Examples; and Personal Experience. Features of the tool, task, and other contextual factors failed to fully support participants at times, impeding task completion. Participants interacted with the tool more readily when its language was familiar and content was personally relevant. When faced with ambiguity and uncertainty, they relied on the tool's visual cues and examples, actively sought relevant personal experiences, and/or requested facilitator support.
CONCLUSIONS: The ability of our participants to successfully use the tool was influenced by the interaction of individual characteristics with those of the tool and other contextual factors. We identified both tool-specific and context-related changes that could overcome barriers to the use of MOVE!23 among Latinas.

It was hypothesized that vecuronium impairs carotid body chemoreceptor function during hypoxia.
METHOD: The effect of systemic administration of vecuronium on single chemoreceptor activity during hypoxia, as recorded from a single nerve fiber preparation of the carotid sinus nerve, was studied in seven mechanically ventilated New Zealand White rabbits during continuous thiopental anesthesia. During normoventilation, the isocapnic hypoxic chemosensitivity of the single carotid body chemoreceptor was measured at four levels of oxygenation; these measurements were repeated at six separate occasions: control recording before injection, after intravenous administrations of 0.1 mg and 0.5 mg of vecuronium, and then at three occasions during a 90-min recovery period. Chemoreceptor chemosensitivity during isocapnic hypoxia was expressed as a hyperbolic function: Chemoreceptor output (Hz) = a + b x PaO2(-1) (mmHg).
RESULTS: Chemosensitivity was reduced after both 0.1 mg and 0.5 mg vecuronium intravenous administration compared with control measurements; the hypoxic response curve was significantly depressed after both doses (P < 0.05). Notably, there was variation in the effect of vecuronium; some chemoreceptor preparations showed only minimal impairment, whereas some showed an almost abolished response to hypoxia. The chemosensitivity remained significantly depressed at 30 and 60 min but had recovered spontaneously at 90 min after 0.5 mg vecuronium.

STUDY DESIGN: A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of women 16 0/7 to 20 6/7 weeks gestation desiring D&E was used. Participants received synthetic osmotic cervical dilators (Dilapan-S®) at least 4 h prior to D&E and were randomized to 400mcg buccal misoprostol or placebo 3 h preoperatively, stratified by gestational age. The primary outcome was operative time with 36 participants needed to detect a 4-min difference (two-sided α=0.05, 80% power). Secondary outcomes included total procedure time, patient and provider acceptability, baseline cervical dilation and complications.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine women were enrolled (misoprostol n=14, placebo n=15) and mean operative time was similar between the groups (11.1 vs. 13.5 min, respectively, p=.17). Complications were nonsignificantly more common for participants ≥19 weeks compared to <19 weeks (22% vs. 9%, p=.62) and those who received placebo compared to misoprostol (27% vs. 7%, p=.33). Two serious adverse events in the placebo group prompted early study closure for safety and futility. Placebo participants had longer overall procedure times (24 vs. 18 min, p=.03) and less cramping preoperatively (p<.01) but similar results for other secondary outcomes compared to those receiving misoprostol. Women strongly preferred same-day cervical preparation (98%).
CONCLUSIONS: Adjunctive buccal misoprostol may not decrease operative times but may decrease complications when combined with synthetic osmotic dilators for cervical preparation for same-day D&E procedures.
IMPLICATIONS: Although the trial was halted early and underpowered to make conclusions about the primary outcome, complication frequency and type warrant caution for use of synthetic osmotic dilators alone for cervical preparation for same-day D&E at ≥19 weeks gestation.",0,PRIMARY,Operative Time,The primary outcome will be operative time.

Adherence to National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health-recommended tick bite prevention methods is poor. A factory-based method for permethrin impregnation of clothing that provides long-lasting insecticidal and repellent activity is commercially available, and studies are needed to assess the long-term effectiveness of this clothing under field conditions.
PURPOSE: To evaluate the protective effectiveness of long-lasting permethrin impregnated uniforms among a cohort of North Carolina outdoor workers.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A double-blind RCT was conducted between March 2011 and September 2012. Subjects included outdoor workers from North Carolina State Divisions of Forestry, Parks and Recreation, and Wildlife who worked in eastern or central North Carolina. A total of 159 volunteer subjects were randomized, and 127 and 101 subjects completed the first and second years of follow-up, respectively.
INTERVENTION: Uniforms of participants in the treatment group were factory-impregnated with long-lasting permethrin whereas control group uniforms received a sham treatment. Participants continued to engage in their usual tick bite prevention activities.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of work-related tick bites reported on weekly tick bite logs.
RESULTS: Study subjects reported 1,045 work-related tick bites over 5,251 person-weeks of follow-up. The mean number of reported tick bites in the year prior to enrollment was similar for both the treatment and control groups, but markedly different during the study period. In our analysis conducted in 2013, the effectiveness of long-lasting permethrin impregnated uniforms for the prevention of work-related tick bites was 0.82 (95% CI=0.66, 0.91) and 0.34 (95% CI=-0.67, 0.74) for the first and second years of follow-up.

Time points of measurement: 72 hours after ROSC.,25238742,Admission interleukin-6 is associated with post resuscitation organ dysfunction and predicts long-term neurological outcome after out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation.,"AIM OF THE STUDY: To study plasma concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and S-100B during intensive care after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest from ventricular fibrillation (OHCA-VF), and their associations with the duration of ischemia, organ dysfunction and long-term neurological outcome.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 12-month prospective observational multicentre study was conducted in 21 Finnish intensive care units in 2011. IL-6, hs-CRP and S-100B were measured at 0-6 h, 24 h, 48 h and 96 h after ICU admission. Associations with the time to return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores divided into tertiles and 12-month cerebral performance category (CPC) were tested.
RESULTS: Of 186 OHCA-VF patients included in the study, 110 (59.1%) patients survived with good neurological outcome (CPC 1-2) 12 months after cardiac arrest. Admission plasma concentrations of IL-6 but not hs-CRP were higher with prolonged time to ROSC (p<0.001, 0.203, respectively), in patients with subsequent higher SOFA scores (p<0.001, 0.069) and poor long-term neurological outcome (CPC 3-5) (p<0.001, 0.315). S-100B concentrations over time were higher in patients with CPC of 3-5 (p<0.001). The area under the curve for prediction of poor 12-month outcome for admission levels was 0.711 IL-6, 0.663 for S-100B and 0.534 for hs-CRP. With multivariate logistic regression analysis only admission IL-6 (p=0.046, OR 1.006, 95% CI 1.000-1.011/ng/L) was an independent predictor of poor neurological outcome.
CONCLUSION: Admission high IL-6, but not hs-CRP or S-100B, is associated with extra-cerebral organ dysfunction and along with age and time to ROSC are independent predictors for 12-month poor neurologic outcome (CPC 3-5).",2,PRIMARY,Early Postresuscitation Central Venous Oxygen Saturation (%) Measured in Blood Samples Obtained Through a Central Venous Catheter Port.,"Results on postresuscitation central venous oxygen saturation (%) are provided for the fifth, pre-specified time point of measurement, i.e., at 72 hours after ROSC.",Steroids Group,Control Group,"Intervention: Stress-dose Steroids.

We have developed a model to expose endothelial cells to well-characterized acoustic fields in vitro and investigate the physical and biological mechanisms involved. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) or bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were grown in tissue culture plates suspended in a temperature-controlled water bath and exposed to US. Exposure to 27 kHz continuous wave US at 0.25 W cm(-2) for 10 min increased HUVEC media NO by 102 +/- 19% (P < 0.05) and BAEC by 117 +/- 23% (P < 0.01). Endothelial cell NO synthase activity increased by 27 +/- 24% in HUVEC and by 32 +/- 16% in BAEC (P < 0.05 for each). The cell response was rapid with a significant increase in NO synthesis by 10 s and a maximum increase after exposure for 1 min. By 30 min post-exposure NO synthesis declined to baseline, indicating that the response was transient. Unexpectedly, pulsing at a 10% duty cycle resulted in a 46% increase in NO synthesis over the response seen with continuous wave US, resulting in an increase of 147 +/- 18%. Cells responded to very low intensity US, with a significant increase at 0.075 W cm(-2) (P < 0.01) and a maximum response at 0.125 W cm(-2). US caused minor reversible changes in cell morphology but did not alter proliferative capacity, indicating absence of injury.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility and efficacy of a fiberoptic probe containing novel polarization gating spectroscopy technology to identify patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAC) by the field effect theory.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort (pilot) study.
SETTING: Outpatient tertiary care center.

Combination therapy with narrow-band ultraviolet B (nbUVB) phototherapy may enhance treatment outcomes and accelerate the onset of clinical response.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of alefacept in combination with nbUVB phototherapy compared to alefacept alone in subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis.
METHODS: Ninety-eight adults with moderate to severe psoriasis were randomized to treatment with alefacept 15 mg intramuscularly (i.m.) once weekly for 12 weeks alone or in combination with three times weekly nbUVB treatments in this prospective, open-label, assessor-blinded, randomized, multicenter, parallel-group, 36-week study.
RESULTS: A statistically significantly greater proportion of subjects in the alefacept plus nbUVB arm achieved the primary endpoint of PASI 75 at week 16 compared to subjects in the alefacept alone arm (44.9% vs 22.5%, P=0.032).

Our aim was to establish ultrasonography for the prepuncture demonstration of the anatomic structures surrounding the thoracic EDS and to evaluate its precision and imaging quality.
METHODS: We examined 20 volunteers. In each participant, the extradural space and the neighboring anatomic landmarks in the intervertebral space Th 5-6 were identified using 2 imaging techniques: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasonography. We compared corresponding images regarding distance measurements and the visibility of anatomic landmarks.
RESULTS: The capacity of ultrasound imaging (US) to depict the thoracic EDS was limited. Due to the better overview, MR images were easier to interpret. However, US proved to be of better value than MRI in the depiction of the dura mater. All important landmarks for the puncture of the thoracic EDS could be identified with both techniques. The overall correlation was satisfactory. US depicted the different structures of the thoracic EDS with an acceptable precision (confidence interval, 4.6 to 8.7 mm).

Food allergy.,"Food allergy, defined as an adverse immune response to food proteins, affects as many as 6% of young children and 3% to 4% of adults. Food-induced allergic reactions are responsible for a variety of symptoms involving the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and respiratory tract and might be caused by IgE-mediated and non-IgE-mediated (cellular) mechanisms. Our understanding of how food allergy represents an abrogation of normal oral tolerance is evolving. Although any food can provoke a reaction, relatively few foods are responsible for the vast majority of significant food-induced allergic reactions: milk, egg, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish. A systematic approach to diagnosis includes a careful history, followed by laboratory studies, elimination diets, and often food challenges to confirm a diagnosis. Many food allergens have been characterized at a molecular level, which has increased our understanding of the immunopathogenesis of food allergy and might soon lead to novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.

Whether adding the Air Quality Index and recommendations to asthma action plans reduces exacerbations and improves control and quality of life in children with asthma is unknown.
METHODS: A pilot, unblinded, randomized clinical trial of 40 children with persistent asthma, stratified by age and randomized 1:1, recruited from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh, PA) was conducted. All participants received asthma action plans and Air Quality Index education. The intervention group received printed Air Quality Index information and showed the ability to use AirNow. Asthma exacerbations were assessed through a questionnaire, asthma control was assessed with the Asthma Control Test and Childhood Asthma Control Test, and quality of life was assessed with the Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire. After randomization (July-October 2020), participants were followed monthly for 6 months (exit January-March 2021). Outcome differences between groups were evaluated at the exit visit and over time (analysis was in 2021).
RESULTS: At randomization, there were no significant differences in age, sex, race, or asthma severity. At exit, more intervention participants checked the Air Quality Index (63% vs 15%) with no differences in the proportion of asthma exacerbations or mean Childhood Asthma Control Test or Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire scores. The mean change in Asthma Control Test score was higher in the intervention group (change in Asthma Control Test=2.00 vs 0.15 for the control), which was modified by time (β=1.85, CI=0.09, 3.61).

Currently licensed pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) confer protection against PD caused by most vaccine serotypes, but non-vaccine serotypes contribute to residual disease. V114 is a 15-valent PCV containing all 13 serotypes in Prevnar 13™ (PCV13) and additional serotypes 22F and 33F. This pivotal phase 3 study compared safety and immunogenicity of V114 and PCV13.
METHODS: 1720 healthy infants were randomized 1:1 to receive a 4-dose regimen of V114 or PCV13 concomitantly with other routine pediatric vaccines. Safety was evaluated after each dose as proportion of participants with adverse events (AEs). Serotype-specific anti-pneumococcal immunoglobulin G (IgG) was measured at 1-month post-dose 3 (PD3), pre-dose 4, and 1-month post-dose 4 (PD4). IgG response rates, geometric mean concentrations (GMCs), and opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) were compared between vaccination groups.
RESULTS: The proportion, maximum intensity, and duration of injection-site, systemic, and serious AEs were generally comparable between V114 and PCV13 groups. In comparison to PCV13, V114 met non-inferiority criteria for all 15 serotypes based on IgG response rates at PD3. V114 met non-inferiority criteria by IgG GMCs for all serotypes at PD3 and PD4, except for serotype 6A at PD3. V114-induced antibodies had bactericidal activity as assessed by OPA. Further, V114 met superiority criteria for shared serotype 3 and unique serotypes 22F and 33F compared to PCV13 by serotype-specific IgG GMCs at both PD3 and PD4. Immunogenicity of concomitantly administered routine pediatric vaccines was comparable in V114 and PCV13 groups.
CONCLUSIONS: In healthy infants, V114 displays acceptable safety and tolerability profiles and generates comparable immune responses to PCV13. V114 also met superiority criteria for serotypes 3, 22F, and 33F. These results support use of V114 for prevention of PD as part of routine infant vaccination schedules.

DESIGN: We conducted a longitudinal study of pooled data from 11 different studies of HIV-infected adults using ART. The main outcome was ART adherence (percent of prescribed doses taken) measured by electronic drug monitoring. We modeled and compared changes in adherence over time using repeated measures linear mixed effects models and generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs). Indicator variables were used to examine the impact of individual studies, and the variation across studies was evaluated using study-specific parameter estimates calculated by using interaction terms of study and time.
RESULTS: The mean age of the subjects was 41 years, 35% were female, most had high school education or less, and 46% were African American. In GAMMs, adherence declined over time. The GAMMs further suggested that the decline was nonlinear, and in both sets of models, there was considerable study-to-study variability in how adherence changed over time.
LIMITATIONS: Findings may not be generalizable to non-US populations or to patients not in clinical studies.

T-VEC was compared with GM-CSF in patients with unresected stage IIIB to IV melanoma in a randomized open-label phase III trial.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with injectable melanoma that was not surgically resectable were randomly assigned at a two-to-one ratio to intralesional T-VEC or subcutaneous GM-CSF. The primary end point was durable response rate (DRR; objective response lasting continuously ≥ 6 months) per independent assessment. Key secondary end points included overall survival (OS) and overall response rate.
RESULTS: Among 436 patients randomly assigned, DRR was significantly higher with T-VEC (16.3%; 95% CI, 12.1% to 20.5%) than GM-CSF (2.1%; 95% CI, 0% to 4.5%]; odds ratio, 8.9; P < .001). Overall response rate was also higher in the T-VEC arm (26.4%; 95% CI, 21.4% to 31.5% v 5.7%; 95% CI, 1.9% to 9.5%). Median OS was 23.3 months (95% CI, 19.5 to 29.6 months) with T-VEC and 18.9 months (95% CI, 16.0 to 23.7 months) with GM-CSF (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.62 to 1.00; P = .051). T-VEC efficacy was most pronounced in patients with stage IIIB, IIIC, or IVM1a disease and in patients with treatment-naive disease. The most common adverse events (AEs) with T-VEC were fatigue, chills, and pyrexia. The only grade 3 or 4 AE occurring in ≥ 2% of T-VEC-treated patients was cellulitis (2.1%). No fatal treatment-related AEs occurred.
CONCLUSION: T-VEC is the first oncolytic immunotherapy to demonstrate therapeutic benefit against melanoma in a phase III clinical trial. T-VEC was well tolerated and resulted in a higher DRR (P < .001) and longer median OS (P = .051), particularly in untreated patients or those with stage IIIB, IIIC, or IVM1a disease.

This pilot study sought to explore the feasibility of improving socioeconomic inclusion outcomes by bolstering identity capital (sense of purpose and control, self-efficacy and self-esteem) among young people who had experienced homelessness.
METHODS: Nineteen individuals (aged 18-26) who had transitioned out of homelessness within the past three years participated in a six-week, six-session program focused on building identity capital. The study employed a mixed method prospective cohort hybrid design with an intervention group (Group One) and a delayed intervention comparison group (Group Two). Participants were interviewed every three months until nine months post-intervention.
RESULTS: None of the youth who began the intervention dropped out of the program, with the exception of one participant who moved across the country and was unable to continue. Immediately after participating in the intervention, Group One had statistically significant improvements (p < .05) and large to very large effect sizes in self-esteem (d = 1.16) and physical community integration (d = 1.79) compared to changes in Group Two over the same period, which had not yet begun the intervention. In the pooled analysis, small to moderate effect sizes in hopelessness, physical community integration, and self-esteem were observed at all post-intervention time points. Notably, at six- and nine-months post-intervention, statistically significant improvements (p < .05) and moderate effect sizes in hopelessness (d = -0.73 and d = -0.60 respectively) and self-esteem (d = 0.71 and d = 0.53 respectively) were observed. Youth shared they appreciated the normalizing (vs. pathologizing) of strategies they needed to learn and spoke of the importance of framing new skills as something one needs ""to have a better life"" vs. ""to get better.""

METHODS: In a multicenter, randomized, open-label clinical trial, 43 patients with recurrent or refractory LN were treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide (CYC), and glucocorticoids followed by weekly belimumab infusions until week 48 (RCB group), or treated with rituximab and CYC but no belimumab infusions (RC group). Patients were followed up until week 96. Percentages of total and autoreactive B cell subsets in the patients' peripheral blood were analyzed by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: Treatment with belimumab did not increase the incidence of adverse events in patients with refractory LN. At week 48, a complete or partial renal response occurred in 11 (52%) of 21 patients receiving belimumab, compared to 9 (41%) of 22 patients in the RC group who did not receive belimumab (P = 0.452). Lack of improvement in or worsening of LN was the major reason for treatment failure. B cell depletion occurred in both groups, but the percentage of B cells remained lower in those receiving belimumab (geometric mean number of B cells at week 60, 53 cells/μl in the RCB group versus 11 cells/μl in the RC group; P = 0.0012). Percentages of total and autoreactive transitional B cells increased from baseline to week 48 in both groups. However, percentages of total and autoreactive naive B cells decreased from baseline to week 48 in the belimumab group compared to the no belimumab RC group (P = 0.0349), a finding that is consistent with the observed impaired maturation of naive B cells and enhanced censoring of autoreactive B cells.
CONCLUSION: The addition of belimumab to a treatment regimen with rituximab and CYC was safe in patients with refractory LN. This regimen diminished maturation of transitional to naive B cells during B cell reconstitution, and enhanced the negative selection of autoreactive B cells.

DESIGN: Randomized, open-label, assessor-blind, parallel groups, multicenter, noninferiority trial.
SETTING: Twenty-five infertility centers in seven countries.
PATIENT(S): Seven hundred forty-nine women.
INTERVENTION(S): Controlled ovarian stimulation with hphMG or rFSH in a GnRH antagonist cycle with compulsory single-blastocyst transfer on day 5 in one fresh or subsequent frozen blastocyst replacement in natural cycles initiated within 1 year of each patient's start of treatment.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Ongoing pregnancy (primary end point) and live birth rates, as well as pharmacodynamic parameters.
RESULT(S): The ongoing pregnancy rate after a fresh cycle was 30% with hphMG versus 27% with rFSH for the per-protocol (PP) population and 29% versus 27% for the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Noninferiority of hphMG compared to rFSH was established. Considering frozen cycles initiated within 1 year, the cumulative live birth rate for a single stimulation cycle was 40% and 38% for women treated with hphMG and rFSH, respectively (both PP and ITT). Significant differences in pharmacodynamic end points were found between the two gonadotropin preparations.

To address this question, we compared placebo analgesia induced through social observation (Group 1) with first-hand experience via a typical conditioning procedure (Group 2) and verbal suggestion alone (Group 3). In Group 1, subjects underwent painful stimuli and placebo treatment after they had observed a demonstrator (actually a simulator) showing analgesic effect when the painful stimuli were paired to a green light. In Group 2, subjects were conditioned according to previous studies, whereby a green light was associated to the surreptitious reduction of stimulus intensity, so as to make them believe that the treatment worked. In Group 3, subjects received painful stimuli and were verbally instructed to expect a benefit from a green light. Pain perception was assessed by means of a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) ranging from 0=no pain to 10=maximum imaginable pain. Empathy trait and heart rate were also measured. We found that observing the beneficial effects in the demonstrator induced substantial placebo analgesic responses, which were positively correlated with empathy scores.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A randomized controlled 3-month trial was conducted with two post-treatment assessments of 200 breast cancer survivors assigned to either 12 weeks of 90-minute twice per week hatha yoga classes or a wait-list control. The main outcome measures were lipopolysaccharide-stimulated production of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and scores on the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF), the vitality scale from the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form (SF-36), and the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale.
RESULTS: Immediately post-treatment, fatigue was not lower (P > .05) but vitality was higher (P = .01) in the yoga group compared with the control group. At 3 months post-treatment, fatigue was lower in the yoga group (P = .002), vitality was higher (P = .01), and IL-6 (P = .027), TNF-α (P = .027), and IL-1β (P = .037) were lower for yoga participants compared with the control group. Groups did not differ on depression at either time (P > .2). Planned secondary analyses showed that the frequency of yoga practice had stronger associations with fatigue at both post-treatment visits (P = .019; P < .001), as well as vitality (P = .016; P = .0045), but not depression (P > .05) than simple group assignment; more frequent practice produced larger changes. At 3 months post-treatment, increasing yoga practice also led to a decrease in IL-6 (P = .01) and IL-1β (P = .03) production but not in TNF-α production (P > .05).

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect on doctors and patients of facilitating patient access to visit notes over secure Internet portals.
DESIGN: Quasi-experimental trial of PCPs and patient volunteers in a year-long program that provided patients with electronic links to their doctors' notes.
SETTING: Primary care practices at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) in Massachusetts, Geisinger Health System (GHS) in Pennsylvania, and Harborview Medical Center (HMC) in Washington.
PARTICIPANTS: 105 PCPs and 13,564 of their patients who had at least 1 completed note available during the intervention period.
MEASUREMENTS: Portal use and electronic messaging by patients and surveys focusing on participants' perceptions of behaviors, benefits, and negative consequences.
RESULTS: 11,155 [corrected] of 13,564 patients with visit notes available opened at least 1 note (84% at BIDMC, 82% [corrected] at GHS, and 47% at HMC). Of 5219 [corrected] patients who opened at least 1 note and completed a postintervention survey, 77% to 59% [corrected] across the 3 sites reported that open notes helped them feel more in control of their care; 60% to 78% of those taking medications reported increased medication adherence; 26% to 36% had privacy concerns; 1% to 8% reported that the notes caused confusion, worry, or offense; and 20% to 42% reported sharing notes with others. The volume of electronic messages from patients did not change. After the intervention, few doctors reported longer visits (0% to 5%) or more time addressing patients' questions outside of visits (0% to 8%), with practice size having little effect; 3% to 36% of doctors reported changing documentation content; and 0% to 21% reported taking more time writing notes. Looking ahead, 59% to 62% of patients believed that they should be able to add comments to a doctor's note. One out of 3 patients believed that they should be able to approve the notes' contents, but 85% to 96% of doctors did not agree. At the end of the experimental period, 99% of patients wanted open notes to continue and no doctor elected to stop.
LIMITATIONS: Only 3 geographic areas were represented, and most participants were experienced in using portals. Doctors volunteering to participate and patients using portals and completing surveys may tend to offer favorable feedback, and the response rate of the patient surveys (41%) may further limit generalizability.
CONCLUSION: Patients accessed visit notes frequently, a large majority reported clinically relevant benefits and minimal concerns, and virtually all patients wanted the practice to continue. With doctors experiencing no more than a modest effect on their work lives, open notes seem worthy of widespread adoption.

This study assessed the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin monotherapy in Japanese T2DM patients with inadequate glycaemic control.
METHODS: Patients (n = 279) were randomized to receive dapagliflozin (1, 2.5, 5 or 10 mg/day) or placebo once daily for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at week 12. Secondary endpoints included change from baseline in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and proportion of patients achieving HbA1c <7.0% at week 12.
RESULTS: Significant reductions in HbA1c were seen with all dapagliflozin doses (-0.11 to -0.44%) versus placebo (+0.37%). Reductions were also observed in FPG with dapagliflozin (-0.87 to -1.77 mmol/l [-15.61 to -31.94 mg/dl]) versus placebo (+0.62 mmol/l [+11.17 mg/dl]). No significant difference in the proportion of patients achieving HbA1c levels <7.0% was noted with dapagliflozin versus placebo.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Treatment-naive patients or those receiving metformin, sulfonylurea, or thiazolidinedione entered a 10-week pioglitazone dose-optimization period with only pioglitazone. They were then randomized, along with patients previously receiving pioglitazone ≥30 mg, to 48 weeks of double-blind dapagliflozin 5 (n = 141) or 10 mg (n = 140) or placebo (n = 139) every day plus open-label pioglitazone. The primary objective compared HbA(1c) change from baseline with dapagliflozin plus pioglitazone versus placebo plus pioglitazone at week 24. Primary analysis was based on ANCOVA model using last observation carried forward; all remaining analyses used repeated-measures analysis.
RESULTS: At week 24, the mean reduction from baseline in HbA(1c) was -0.42% for placebo versus -0.82 and -0.97% for dapagliflozin 5 and 10 mg groups, respectively (P = 0.0007 and P < 0.0001 versus placebo).

We did a multicentre randomised controlled trial to test the hypothesis that intrapartum monitoring with cardiotocography combined with automatic ST-waveform analysis results in an improved perinatal outcome compared with cardiotocography alone.
METHODS: At three Swedish labour wards, 4966 women with term fetuses in the cephalic presentation entered the trial during labour after a clinical decision had been made to apply a fetal scalp electrode for internal cardiotocography. They were randomly assigned monitoring with cardiotocography plus ST analysis (CTG+ST group) or cardiotocography only (CTG group). The main outcome measure was rate of umbilical-artery metabolic acidosis (pH <7.05 and base deficit >12 mmol/L). Secondary outcomes included operative delivery for fetal distress. Results were first analysed according to intention to treat, and secondly after exclusion of cases with severe malformations or with inadequate monitoring.
FINDINGS: The CTG+ST group showed significantly lower rates of umbilical-artery metabolic acidosis than the cardiotocography group (15 of 2159 [0.7%] vs 31 of 2079 [2%], relative risk 0.47 [95% CI 0.25-0.86], p=0.02) and of operative delivery for fetal distress (193 of 2519 [8%] vs 227 of 2447 [9%], 0.83 [0.69-0.99], p=0.047) when all cases were included according to intention to treat. The differences were more pronounced after exclusion of 291 in the CTG+ST group and 283 in the CTG group with malformations or inadequate recording.

Our purpose was to assess the effectiveness of team training and its impact on patient show-up and completion rates for their MRI examinations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 97,712 patient visits from three tertiary academic medical centers over 1-year intervals were evaluated, totaling 49,733 visits at baseline and 47,979 after training. Each center's MRI team received team training skill training including advanced communication and team training techniques training. This training included onsite instruction including case simulation with scenarios requiring appropriate behavioral and communicative interventions. Orientation and training also utilized customized online tools and proctoring. The study completion rate and patient show-up rate during consecutive year-long intervals before and after team training were compared to assess its effectiveness. Two-sided chi-square tests for proportions using were applied at a 0.05 significance level.
RESULTS: Despite differing no-show rates (5-22.2%) and study incompletion rates (0.7-3.7%) at the three academic centers, the combined patients' data showed significant (P < 0.0001) improvement in the patients' no-show rates (combined decreases from 11.2% to 8.7%) and incompletion rates (combined decreases from 2.3% to 1.4%).
CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results suggest training of the imaging team can improve the no-show and incompletion rates of the MRI service, positively affecting throughput and utilization.

However, patients with cardiovascular conditions have a reduced immune response to influenza vaccine, potentially resulting in reduced effectiveness for preventing clinical events. High-dose vaccine augments immune response in cardiac patients, suggesting that a high-dose influenza vaccination strategy may further reduce morbidity and mortality. Alternatively, broader coverage with an influenza vaccine containing an increased number of viral strains is an alternative strategy without direct evaluation.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: INfluenza Vaccine to Effectively Stop Cardio Thoracic Events and Decompensated heart failure (INVESTED) is a pragmatic, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, active-controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of an annual vaccination strategy of high-dose trivalent versus standard-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine in patients with a history of recent heart failure or myocardial infarction hospitalization. The trial will enroll approximately 9,300 patients over 4 influenza seasons. The primary hypothesis is that high-dose influenza vaccine will reduce the composite outcome of all-cause mortality and hospitalization from a cardiovascular or pulmonary cause compared with standard-dose influenza vaccine within each enrolling season. Approximately 1,300 primary outcome events will provide >90% power to detect an 18% relative risk reduction at a 2-sided α level of .05.

An injection of autologous blood might provide the necessary cellular and humoral mediators to induce a healing cascade. The purpose of this study was to evaluate prospectively the results of refractory lateral epicondylitis treated with autologous blood injections.
METHOD: Twenty-eight patients with lateral epicondylitis were injected with 2 mL of autologous blood under the extensor carpi radialis brevis. All patients had failed previous nonsurgical treatments including all or combinations of physical therapy, splinting, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication, and prior steroid injections. Patients kept personal logs and rated their pain (0-10) and categorized themselves according to Nirschl staging (0-7) daily.
RESULTS: The average follow-up period was 9.5 months (range, 6-24 mo). After autologous blood injections the average pain score decreased from 7.8 to 2.3. The average Nirschl stage decreased from 6.5 to 2.0. For the 9 patients receiving more than one blood injection the mean pain score and Nirschl stage before injection were 7.2 and 6.6, respectively. After the second blood injection the pain and Nirschl scores were both 0.9. Two patients received a third blood injection that brought both pain and Nirschl scores to 0.
CONCLUSIONS: After autologous blood injection therapy 22 patients (79%) in whom nonsurgical modalities had failed were relieved completely of pain even during strenuous activity. This study offers encouraging results of an alternative minimally invasive treatment that addresses the pathophysiology of lateral epicondylitis that has failed traditional nonsurgical modalities.",1,PRIMARY,Pain(at 12 Weeks): Visual Analogue Scale,"VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE:

DESIGN AND SETTING: A prospective observational single-center study in a medical intensive care unit.
PATIENTS: 64 patients hospitalised in the intensive care unit after successful resuscitation for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: A corticotropin-stimulation test was performed between 12 and 24 h following admission: serum cortisol level was measured before and 60 min after administration of tetracosactide 250 microg. Patients with an incremental response less than 9 microg/dl were considered to have relative adrenal insufficiency (non-responders). Variables were expressed as medians and interquartile ranges. 33 patients (52%) had relative adrenal insufficiency. Baseline cortisol level was higher in non-responders than in responders (41 [27.2-55.5] vs. 22.8 [15.7-35.1] microg/dl respectively, P=0.001). A long interval before initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation was associated with relative adrenal insufficiency (5 [3-10] vs. 3 [3-5] min, P=0.03). Of the 38 patients with post-resuscitation shock, 13 died of irreversible multiorgan failure. The presence of relative adrenal insufficiency was identified as a poor prognostic factor of shock-related mortality (log-rank P=0.02). A trend towards higher mortality in non-responders was identified in a multivariate logistic regression analysis (odds ratio 6.77, CI 95% 0.94-48.99, P=0.058).
CONCLUSIONS: Relative adrenal insufficiency occurs frequently after successful resuscitation of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, and appears to be associated with a poor prognosis in cases of post-resuscitation shock.

Recent findings suggest patient interactions within such systems are associated with patient outcomes. To evaluate the relationship between level of patient depression and spouse psychosocial status, 55 couples in which one partner was undergoing chronic hemodialysis therapy for ESRD were interviewed. Two variables that alone and in interaction with one another were expected to relate to the spouse's level of depression and marital satisfaction were investigated: patient depression level and spouse's perceived social support. Depression was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Spouses' levels of depressive affect correlated directly with patient BDI scores. A significant two-way interaction for spousal depression (patient depression and spousal support) supported viewing spouses' adjustment as a function of the interaction between spouse and patient factors. Additionally, a main effect of perceived spousal social support on spousal marital satisfaction indicated that spouses reporting high levels of social support had the least marital strain. The severity of the patient's illness did not correlate with any of the predictor variables or measures of spousal adjustment, but spouses reported significantly lower functional status for patients than did nephrologists. Spouse and patient levels of depression are related, although causal relationships cannot be determined by these studies. Moreover, spouse perception of marital satisfaction is related to depression scores. These findings suggest the patient with ESRD functions in a psychosocial dyad. Spouse psychosocial status could impact on the level of patient depression, and the spouse might be amenable to interventions that could improve patient outcome.",2,PRIMARY,Baseline Sexual Satisfaction Between Matched Female and Male Partners,"Prior to beginning treatment with solifenacin, females presenting with UUI complete the Golombok Rust Inventory of Sexual Satisfaction (GRISS).

We compared contrast enhancement in acute infarction (AI), after severe but reversible ischemic injury (RII), and in chronic infarction.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In dogs, a large coronary artery was occluded to study AI and/or chronic infarction (n = 18), and a second coronary artery was chronically instrumented with a reversible hydraulic occluder and Doppler flowmeter to study RII (n = 8). At 3 days after surgery, cine MRI revealed reduced wall thickening in AI (5+/-6% versus 33+/-6% in normal, P<0.001). In RII, wall thickening before, during, and after inflation of the occluder for 15 minutes was 35+/-5%, 1+/-8%, and 21+/-10% and Doppler flow was 19.8+/-5.3, 0.2+/-0.5, and 56.3+/-17.7 (peak hyperemia) cm/s, respectively, confirming occlusion, transient ischemia, and reperfusion. Gd-DTPA-enhanced MR images acquired 30 minutes after contrast revealed hyperenhancement of AI (294+/-96% of normal, P<0.001) but not of RII (98+/-6% of normal, P = NS). Eight weeks later, the chronically infarcted region again hyperenhanced (253+/-54% of normal, n = 8, P<0.001). High-resolution (0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 mm) ex vivo MRI demonstrated that the spatial extent of hyperenhancement was the same as the spatial extent of myocyte necrosis with and without reperfusion at 1 day (R = 0.99, P<0.001) and 3 days (R = 0.99, P<0.001) and collagenous scar at 8 weeks (R = 0.97, P<0.001).

In this new era of HIV as a chronic disease, the continued success of ART will depend critically on sustained high ART adherence. The objective of this review was to systematically review interventions that can improve adherence to ART, including individual-level interventions and changes to the structure of ART delivery, to inform the evidence base for the 2013 WHO consolidated antiretroviral guidelines.
DESIGN: A rapid systematic review.
METHODS: We conducted a rapid systematic review of the global evidence on interventions to improve adherence to ART, utilizing pre-existing systematic reviews to identify relevant research evidence complemented by screening of databases for articles published over the past 2 years on evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We searched five databases for both systematic reviews and primary RCT studies (Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and WHO Global Health Library); we additionally searched ClinicalTrials.gov for RCT studies. We examined intervention effectiveness by different study characteristics, in particular, the specific populations who received the intervention.
RESULTS: A total of 124 studies met our selection criteria. Eighty-six studies were RCTs. More than 20 studies have tested the effectiveness of each of the following interventions, either singly or in combination with other interventions: cognitive-behavioural interventions, education, treatment supporters, directly observed therapy, and active adherence reminder devices (such as mobile phone text messages). Although there is strong evidence that all five of these interventions can significantly increase ART adherence in some settings, each intervention has also been found not to produce significant effects in several studies. Almost half (55) of the 124 studies investigated the effectiveness of combination interventions. Combination interventions tended to have effects that were similar to those of single interventions. The evidence base on interventions in key populations was weak, with the exception of interventions for people who inject drugs.
CONCLUSION: Tested and effective adherence-enhancing interventions should be increasingly moved into implementation in routine programme and care settings, accompanied by rigorous evaluation of implementation impact and performance. Major evidence gaps on adherence-enhancing interventions remain, in particular, on the cost-effectiveness of interventions in different settings, long-term effectiveness, and effectiveness of interventions in specific populations, such as pregnant and breastfeeding women.",2,PRIMARY,Dichotomous Adherence,"Number of Participants who Reported Taking Greater Than or Equal to 75% of Prescribed Dosage, based on electronic monitoring.

In this study, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) was used to investigate functional connectivity in the CSTC circuitry in adolescents with OCD. Imaging was obtained with the Human Connectome Project (HCP) scanner using newly developed pulse sequences which allow for higher spatial and temporal resolution. Fifteen adolescents with OCD and 13 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (ages 12-19) underwent R-fMRI on the 3T HCP scanner. Twenty-four minutes of resting-state scans (two consecutive 12-min scans) were acquired. We investigated functional connectivity of the striatum using a seed-based, whole brain approach with anatomically-defined seeds placed in the bilateral caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens. Adolescents with OCD compared with controls exhibited significantly lower functional connectivity between the left putamen and a single cluster of right-sided cortical areas including parts of the orbitofrontal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, insula, and operculum. Preliminary findings suggest that impaired striatal connectivity in adolescents with OCD in part falls within the predicted CSTC network, and also involves impaired connections between a key CSTC network region (i.e., putamen) and key regions in the salience network (i.e., insula/operculum).

When diet, exercise, and treatment with sulfonylurea and metformin do not achieve glycemic goals, several options are available. The present study evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of sitagliptin 100 mg/day added to therapy with sulfonylurea and metformin.
METHODS: Patients with HbA1c ≥7.5% and ≤10.5% while on a sulfonylurea and metformin were randomized 1: 1 to sitagliptin 100 mg/day or placebo for 24 weeks. At Week 24, patients in the placebo group switched to pioglitazone 30 mg/day and both groups continued treatment for another 30 weeks.
RESULTS: Of 427 patients randomized, 339 (79.4%) completed the study. At Week 24, significantly greater (P < 0.001) mean reductions from baseline were seen in the sitagliptin versus placebo group for HbA1c (-0.84% vs -0.16%, respectively), 2-h post-meal glucose (-2.0 vs -0.2 mmol/L, respectively) and fasting plasma glucose (-0.7 vs 0.3 mmol/L, respectively). At Week 54, improvements in glycemic control continued. At Week 24, the incidence of adverse events (AEs) was numerically greater with sitagliptin than placebo, primarily because of a higher incidence of hypoglycemia. At Week 54, the incidence of AEs was similar in both groups, primarily because of a higher incidence of hypoglycemia and edema in the placebo/pioglitazone group after Week 24.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether fenfluramine reduced monthly convulsive seizure frequency relative to placebo in patients with Dravet syndrome who were taking stiripentol-inclusive regimens.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group randomized clinical trial was conducted in multiple centers. Eligible patients were children aged 2 to 18 years with a confirmed clinical diagnosis of Dravet syndrome who were receiving stable, stiripentol-inclusive antiepileptic drug regimens.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients with 6 or more convulsive seizures during the 6-week baseline period were randomly assigned to receive fenfluramine, 0.4 mg/kg/d (maximum, 17 mg/d), or a placebo. After titration (3 weeks), patients' assigned dosages were maintained for 12 additional weeks. Caregivers recorded seizures via a daily electronic diary.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary efficacy end point was the change in mean monthly convulsive seizure frequency between fenfluramine and placebo during the combined titration and maintenance periods relative to baseline.
RESULTS: A total of 115 eligible patients were identified; of these, 87 patients (mean [SD], age 9.1 [4.8] years; 50 male patients [57%]; mean baseline frequency of seizures, approximately 25 convulsive seizures per month) were enrolled and randomized to fenfluramine, 0.4 mg/kg/d (n = 43) or placebo (n = 44). Patients treated with fenfluramine achieved a 54.0% (95% CI, 35.6%-67.2%; P < .001) greater reduction in mean monthly convulsive seizure frequency than those receiving the placebo. With fenfluramine, 54% of patients demonstrated a clinically meaningful (≥50%) reduction in monthly convulsive seizure frequency vs 5% with placebo (P < .001). The median (range) longest seizure-free interval was 22 (3.0-105.0) days with fenfluramine and 13 (1.0-40.0) days with placebo (P = .004). The most common adverse events were decreased appetite (19 patients taking fenfluramine [44%] vs 5 taking placebo [11%]), fatigue (11 [26%] vs 2 [5%]), diarrhea (10 [23%] vs 3 [7%]), and pyrexia (11 [26%] vs 4 [9%]). Cardiac monitoring demonstrated no clinical or echocardiographic evidence of valvular heart disease or pulmonary arterial hypertension.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Fenfluramine demonstrated significant improvements in monthly convulsive seizure frequency in patients with Dravet syndrome whose conditions were insufficiently controlled with stiripentol-inclusive antiepileptic drug regimens. Fenfluramine was generally well tolerated. Fenfluramine may represent a new treatment option for Dravet syndrome.

The authors sought to determine whether opioid modulation achieved through administration of ALKS 5461, a combination of a μ- and κ-opioid partial agonist, buprenorphine, and a μ-opioid antagonist, samidorphan, would exhibit antidepressant activity in patients with major depression.
METHOD: A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-stage sequential parallel comparison design study was conducted in adults with major depression who had an inadequate response to one or two courses of antidepressant treatment. Participants were randomly assigned to receive adjunctive treatment with 2 mg/2 mg of buprenorphine/samidorphan (the 2/2 dosage group), 8 mg/8 mg of buprenorphine/samidorphan (the 8/8 dosage group), or placebo. Antidepressant effect was measured based on change from baseline to the end of 4 weeks of treatment on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and the Clinical Global Impressions severity scale (CGI-S).
RESULTS: Compared with the placebo group, there were significantly greater improvements in the 2/2 dosage group across the three depression outcome measures (HAM-D: -2.8, 95% CI=-5.1, -0.6; MADRS: -4.9, 95% CI=-8.2, -1.6; CGI-S: -0.5, 95% CI=-0.9, -0.1). There was also evidence of improvement in the 8/8 dosage group, although it did not achieve statistical significance. Overall, the buprenorphine/samidorphan combinations were well tolerated, and there was no evidence of opioid withdrawal on treatment discontinuation.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a 24 week treat-to-target trial (NCT01123980) that included patients with T2DM who were poorly controlled on a combination of metformin and insulin secretagogue (or with a maximum of one more OAD) for 6 months. Patients were randomized to once daily BIAsp 30 or once daily IGlar and their secretagogue standardized to glimepiride 4 mg/day, metformin to 1500 or 2500 mg/day before randomization.
RESULTS: At Week 24, mean change from baseline in HbA1c was -0.78 ± 0.88% (mean ± SD) and -0.65 ± 0.92% (-8.49 ± 9.65 and -7.08 ± 10.1 mmol/mol) for the BIAsp 30 (n = 261) and IGlar (n = 260) groups, respectively. The estimated between-group difference (BIAsp 30 vs IGlar) in HbA1c change was -0.12% (95% CI: -0.25, 0.02) (-1.28 mmol/mol [95% CI: -2.75, 0.19]), thus treatment with BIAsp 30 was noninferior to IGlar with respect to HbA1c (non-inferiority margin 0.4%). Although reduction in mean 9-point self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) profile was comparable between the two groups, BIAsp 30 showed significantly lower PG levels at three time points post-dinner and a higher PG level before dinner compared to the IGlar group (all p < 0.05). Comparable number of subjects reported hypoglycemic events (155 [59.4%] for BIAsp 30, 148 [56.9%] for IGlar).
CONCLUSIONS: BIAsp 30 once daily showed similar HbA1c reduction and a similar safety profile to IGlar when used in insulin-naïve Chinese and Japanese patients on metformin and a sulfonylurea.

We characterized the nature and level of caregiver burden and psychiatric morbidity in spouses of persons diagnosed with MCI.
METHODS: Interview assessments were completed on a cohort of 27 spouses of persons with a recent diagnosis of MCI. Patient medical records were reviewed to collect information regarding the MCI patient's medical history.
RESULTS: Respondents endorsed elevated levels of both task-related responsibilities and subjective caregiver burden. Depression and anxiety symptom levels also showed some elevations. Measures of caregiver burden were significantly associated with depression and anxiety levels. In particular, even after controlling for demographic risk factors for distress, nursing task burden was correlated with elevated depressive symptoms, and greater lifestyle constraints were correlated with higher anxiety levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Although caregiver burden and psychiatric morbidity levels were lower than those typically observed in family dementia caregiving samples, our findings suggest that MCI caregivers have already begun to experience distress in association with elevated caregiving burden. These individuals may be ideal targets for selective preventive interventions to maximize their psychological well-being as caregiving burdens related to their spouses' cognitive impairment increase.",2,PRIMARY,Depressive Symptoms,"Depressive symptoms were measured with Center for Epidemiological Studies - Depression Scale (CES-D). The CES-D was designed as a self-report measure of depressive symptoms in nonpsychiatric subjects and has been used with spousal dementia caregiving populations with no report of negative psychological effects. It is composed of 20 items, each rated on a 4-point response scale corresponding to the frequency of the symptom in the preceding week. The possible range of CES-D scores is 0-60, with a higher score indicating more severe symptoms. A cutoff score of 16 or greater is indicative of individuals at high risk for clinical depression. The CES-D was chosen because of its relatively high internal reliability (Cronbach's alpha = .88) and predictive validity for the diagnosis of depression.",Problem Solving Intervention,Nutritional Intervention,"The experimental Intervention (PST-MCI/AD Caregiving) focuses on training in adaptive problem-solving attitudes and skills (Problem-Solving Therapy or PST).

OBJECTIVE: To test whether administration of inhaled nitric oxide to preterm infants requiring positive pressure respiratory support on postnatal days 5 to 14 improves the rate of survival without BPD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This intent-to-treat study was a randomized clinical trial performed at 33 US and Canadian neonatal intensive care units. Participants included 451 neonates younger than 30 weeks' gestation with birth weight less than 1250 g receiving mechanical ventilation or positive pressure respiratory support on postnatal days 5 to 14. Enrollment spanned from December 23, 2009, to April 23, 2012, and neurodevelopmental outcome studies were completed by April 4, 2014.
INTERVENTIONS: Placebo (nitrogen) or inhaled nitric oxide initiated at 20 ppm was decreased to 10 ppm between 72 and 96 hours after starting treatment and then to 5 ppm on day 10 or 11. Infants remained on the 5-ppm dose until completion of therapy (24 days).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the rate of survival without BPD at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA). Secondary outcomes included BPD severity, postnatal corticosteroid use, respiratory support, survival, and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 to 24 months' PMA.
RESULTS: In total, 222 infants (52.3% male [n = 116]) received placebo, and 229 infants (50.2% male [n = 115]) received inhaled nitric oxide. Their mean (SD) gestation was 25.6 (1.5) vs 25.6 (1.4) weeks, and their mean (SD) birth weight was 750 (164) vs 724 (160) g. Survival without BPD at 36 weeks' PMA was similar between the placebo and inhaled nitric oxide groups (31.5% [n = 70] vs 34.9% [n = 80]) (odds ratio, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.79-1.73). Rates for severe BPD (26.6% [55 of 207] vs 20.5% [43 of 210]) and postnatal corticosteroid use for BPD (41.0% [91 of 222] vs 41.5% [95 of 229]) and the mean (SD) days of positive pressure respiratory support (55 [40] vs 54 [42]), oxygen therapy (88 [41] vs 91 [59]), and hospitalization (105 [37] vs 108 [54]) were equivalent between the 2 groups. No differences in the incidence of common morbidities were observed. Respiratory outcomes on discharge to home, at 1 year, and at age 18 to 24 months' PMA and neurodevelopmental assessments at 18 to 24 months' PMA did not differ between groups.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Inhaled nitric oxide, initiated at 20 ppm on postnatal days 5 to 14 to high-risk preterm infants and continued for 24 days, appears to be safe but did not improve survival without BPD at 36 weeks' PMA or respiratory and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 to 24 months' PMA.

STUDY DESIGN: This was a 4-year retrospective cohort study of 5388 consecutive singleton, nonanomalous gestations of 37 weeks or longer. The primary exposure was the EFM pattern in the 30 minutes preceding delivery. EFM patterns were prospectively interpreted using Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) nomenclature as well as non-NICHD measurements of decelerations. The primary outcome was umbilical cord arterial pH of 7.10 or less.
RESULTS: Four NICHD-defined EFM features within the 30 minutes prior to birth demonstrated the greatest association with acidemia: repetitive prolonged decelerations (area under the curve [AUC] 0.81), baseline tachycardia (AUC 0.80), repetitive variable decelerations (AUC 0.79), and repetitive late decelerations (0.78) after adjusting for nulliparity, fever, prolonged first stage, and obesity.

METHODS: Patients with type 2 diabetes (age ≥ 18 years) who were treated with a stable dose of a sulphonylurea with or without metformin for at least 3 months prior to screening, who had an HbA(1c) < 10% and who expressed their intention to daytime fast during Ramadan were eligible for this open-label study. Patients were randomised in a 1 : 1 ratio to either switch to sitagliptin 100 mg qd or to remain on their prestudy sulphonylurea. Patients completed daily diary cards to document information on hypoglycaemic symptoms and complications. The primary end-point was the overall incidence of symptomatic hypoglycaemia recorded during Ramadan.
RESULTS: Of the 1066 patients randomised, 1021 (n = 507 for sitagliptin and n = 514 for sulphonylurea) returned at least one completed diary card and were included in the analysis. The proportion of patients who recorded one or more symptomatic hypoglycaemic events during Ramadan was lower in the sitagliptin group (6.7%) compared with the sulphonylurea group (13.2%). The risk of symptomatic hypoglycaemia was significantly decreased with sitagliptin relative to sulphonylurea treatment (Mantel-Haenszel relative risk ratio [95% CI] = 0.51 [0.34, 0.75]; p < 0.001). There were no reported events that required medical assistance (i.e. visits to physician or emergency room or hospitalisations) or were considered severe (i.e. events that caused loss of consciousness, seizure, coma or physical injury) during Ramadan.
CONCLUSIONS: In Muslim patients with type 2 diabetes who observed the fast during Ramadan, switching to a sitagliptin-based regimen decreased the risk of hypoglycaemia compared with remaining on a sulphonylurea-based regimen.

This study evaluated the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of PRV when used concomitantly with a hexavalent vaccine containing diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, hepatitis B, inactivated poliovirus, and Haemophilus influenzae type b.
METHODS: Healthy infants (N = 403) received hexavalent vaccine concomitantly with either PRV or placebo at 2, 3, and 4 months of age. Antibody responses were measured immediately before and 42 +/- 3 days after vaccination. Parents/legal guardians recorded all adverse events for 14 days after vaccination.
RESULTS: Seroprotective titers for hepatitis B (hepatitis B surface antigen > or =10 mIU/mL) were achieved by 97.8% of subjects in both vaccine treatment groups. Seroprotective titers to H. influenzae type b (polyribosylribitol phosphate > or =0.15 microg/mL) were achieved by 91.4% of subjects receiving both vaccines and 95.1% of subjects receiving only hexavalent vaccine. Seroprotective titers to diphtheria, tetanus, and poliovirus were also comparable between the vaccine treatment groups, as were geometric mean antibody titers to the pertussis antigens. Among PRV recipients, 92% had a > or =3-fold rise in serum antirotavirus immunoglobulin A levels. Concomitant administration was well tolerated.

The objective of CLEAR Tranquility (NCT03001076) was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid when added to background lipid-modifying therapy in patients with a history of statin intolerance who require additional LDL-C lowering.
METHODS: This phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled patients with a history of statin intolerance and an LDL-C ≥100 mg/dL while on stable lipid-modifying therapy. After a 4-week ezetimibe 10 mg/day run-in period, patients were randomized 2:1 to treatment with bempedoic acid 180 mg or placebo once daily added to ezetimibe 10 mg/day for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the percent change from baseline to week 12 in LDL-C.
RESULTS: The study population comprised 269 patients (181 bempedoic acid, 88 placebo). Bempedoic acid added to background lipid-modifying therapy that included ezetimibe reduced LDL-C by 28.5% more than placebo (p < 0.001; -23.5% bempedoic acid, +5.0% placebo).

L/D-AMT is obtained from a novel process for making the L-enantiomer (L-AMT), a potent oral antiinflammatory agent. The purpose of these studies was to characterize oral uptake and safety in the dog and human of each enantiomer alone and in combination and provide in vitro evidence for a mechanism of intestinal absorption. This is the first report of L /D-AMT in humans. In dogs (n = 40) orally dosed with L-AMT or D-AMT absorption was stereoselective for the L-enantiomer (6- to 12-fold larger peak plasma concentration after oral administration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve at 0-4 h; p < 0.001). D-AMT was not toxic at the maximal dose tested (82.5 mg/kg), which was 100-fold larger than the maximal nonlethal L-AMT dose (0.8 mg/kg). Dogs (n = 10) and humans with psoriasis (n = 21) orally administered L-AMT and L /D-AMT at the same L-enantiomer dose resulted in stereoselective absorption (absent D-enantiomer in plasma), bioequivalent L-enantiomer pharmacokinetics, and equivalent safety. Thus, the D-enantiomer in L/D-AMT did not perturb L-enantiomer absorption or alter the safety of L-AMT. In vitro uptake by the human proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT) demonstrated minimal transport of D-AMT compared with L-AMT, mirroring the in vivo findings. Enantiomer selectivity by PCFT was attributable almost entirely to decreased binding affinity rather than changes in transport rate. Collectively, our results demonstrate a strong in vitro-in vivo correlation implicating stereoselective transport by PCFT as the mechanism underlying stereoselective absorption observed in vivo.",0,PRIMARY,Subjects With >=75% Reduction in Baseline Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) (Efficacy),"As follows:

Whether adding the Air Quality Index and recommendations to asthma action plans reduces exacerbations and improves control and quality of life in children with asthma is unknown.
METHODS: A pilot, unblinded, randomized clinical trial of 40 children with persistent asthma, stratified by age and randomized 1:1, recruited from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh, PA) was conducted. All participants received asthma action plans and Air Quality Index education. The intervention group received printed Air Quality Index information and showed the ability to use AirNow. Asthma exacerbations were assessed through a questionnaire, asthma control was assessed with the Asthma Control Test and Childhood Asthma Control Test, and quality of life was assessed with the Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire. After randomization (July-October 2020), participants were followed monthly for 6 months (exit January-March 2021). Outcome differences between groups were evaluated at the exit visit and over time (analysis was in 2021).
RESULTS: At randomization, there were no significant differences in age, sex, race, or asthma severity. At exit, more intervention participants checked the Air Quality Index (63% vs 15%) with no differences in the proportion of asthma exacerbations or mean Childhood Asthma Control Test or Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire scores.

DESIGN: Randomized prospective study.
SETTING: University Clinic of Obstetrics and Gynecology.
PATIENTS: 300 parturients, 85 of whom had conventional delivery and 65 who underwent cesarean section.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients underwent ultrasonography for the identification of the intervertebral structures. Puncture depth and angle were measured to improve the placement of the Tuohy needle.
MEASUREMENTS: In the ultrasound group, additional puncture data, optimized puncture point, expected puncture depth, and angle were used to optimize the puncture technique. To control for side effects, we compiled data on the number of puncture attempts and the number of necessary puncture levels, visual analog scale (VAS) scores, the rate of side effects, and the patient acceptance of the technique.
MAIN RESULTS: The two groups were similar regarding demographic data. Using ultrasound for structure detection, the rate of puncture attempts were significantly (p < 0.013) reduced from 2.18 +/- 1.07 to 1.35 +/- 0.61. The mean rate of necessary puncture levels was 1.30 +/- 0.55 and with ultrasound detection 1.136 +/- 0.36 (p < 0.029). Complete analgesia was achieved in 147 patients with ultrasound detection versus 138 patients in the Control group (p < 0,03). The maximum VAS pain score in the control group was 1.3 +/- 2.1 versus 0.8 +/- 1.5 in the Ultrasound group (p < 0.006).

We sought to describe symptoms and satisfaction in a cohort of women undergoing these procedures.
METHODS: Females undergoing urodynamics completed questionnaires immediately (Q1) and 1 week (Q2) after their testing. Surveys utilized visual analog scales (VAS) from 0 to 10 to assess pain, embarrassment, anxiety, and satisfaction. Q2 also inquired about urinary symptoms in the days following the procedure.
RESULTS: 100 women were analyzed. Regarding symptoms on the day of testing, VAS scores indicated low bother; with a median of 1.5/10 for pain, 0.4/10 for embarrassment, and 1.8/10 for anxiety. One week following, recall of pain (p = 0.169), and embarrassment (p = 0.722) were similar. Further analyses suggested that overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) might be associated with greater pain during and after the procedure (p = 0.04, p = 0.038 respectively), while depression was associated with greater embarrassment at those times (p = 0.018, p = 0.027 respectively). Painful bladder syndrome (PBS) was associated with a higher recall of pain (p = 0.018), and anxiety with more embarrassment (p = 0.033) on the second survey. Finally, younger age correlated with higher pain on both questionnaires (Q1: τ = - 0.148, p = 0.029; Q2: τ = - 0.171, p = 0.014). Following urodynamics, urgency was most common (43%), generally resolving within 1 day. Reassuringly, 86% would repeat urodynamics if necessary, and overall satisfaction was rated ≥9/10 at both time points.

The impact of low-volume, leukoreduced RBC transfusion on general surgery patients is less well understood.
STUDY DESIGN: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program participant use file was queried for general surgery patients recorded in 2005 to 2006 (n = 125,223). Thirty-day morbidity (21 uniformly defined complications) and mortality, demographic, preoperative, and intraoperative risk variables were obtained. Infectious complications and composite morbidity and mortality were stratified across intraoperative PRBCs units received. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess influence of transfusion on outcomes, while adjusting for transfusion propensity, procedure type, wound class, operative duration, and 30+ patient risk factors.
RESULTS: After adjustment for transfusion propensity, procedure group, wound class, operative duration, and all other important risk variables, 1 U PRBCs significantly (p < 0.05) increased risk of 30-day mortality (odds ratio [OR] = 1.32), composite morbidity (OR = 1.23), pneumonia (OR = 1.24), and sepsis/shock (OR = 1.29).

We have previously shown that a single dose of ketamine, a glutamate N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, is associated with a rapid reduction in depressive symptom severity and SI in patients with treatment-resistant depression.
METHOD: We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of ketamine in patients with mood and anxiety spectrum disorders who presented with clinically significant SI (n = 24). Patients received a single infusion of ketamine or midazolam (as an active placebo) in addition to standard of care. SI measured using the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (BSI) 24 h post-treatment represented the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale--Suicidal Ideation (MADRS-SI) score at 24 h and additional measures beyond the 24-h time-point.
RESULTS: The intervention was well tolerated and no dropouts occurred during the primary 7-day assessment period. BSI score was not different between the treatment groups at 24 h (p = 0.32); however, a significant difference emerged at 48 h (p = 0.047). MADRS-SI score was lower in the ketamine group compared to midazolam group at 24 h (p = 0.05). The treatment effect was no longer significant at the end of the 7-day assessment period.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess safety and efficacy of etanercept administered intermittently in children with psoriasis.
METHODS: At study entry, patients were 4 to 17 years old with moderate to severe stable plaque psoriasis (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index [PASI] score ≥ 12). After an initial 12-week, double-blind period and a 24-week, open-label period, eligible patients (ie, achieved 75% improvement in PASI response from baseline [PASI 75]) were re-randomized to a 12-week, double-blind withdrawal-retreatment period: patients received placebo (withdrawal) or etanercept as long as they maintained PASI 75; otherwise, they were retreated with open-label etanercept (retreatment).
RESULTS: The 138 patients who entered the withdrawal-retreatment period were re-randomized equally between placebo and etanercept. In the group treated with blinded or open-label etanercept, 52 of 65 (80%; observed data) patients maintained or regained PASI 75 at the end of the 12-week period. In all, 45 of 64 (70%) patients on blinded etanercept maintained PASI 75 at every study visit during the 12-week period, compared with 35 of 65 (54%) patients who did so on blinded placebo. No patient had a serious adverse event, serious infection, or withdrew from study because of an adverse event.
LIMITATIONS: Small study and short observation period are limitations.
CONCLUSION: During the final 12-week withdrawal-retreatment period of this 48-week study, intermittent etanercept therapy appeared safe, with no patients experiencing a serious adverse event or serious infection, and effective, with 80% of patients on etanercept maintaining or regaining PASI 75 at the end of the 12-week period.",2,PRIMARY,Percentage of Participants Achieving a ≥ 75% Improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index Score (PASI 75) at Week 12,"The percentage of participants who achieved 75% or greater improvement (decrease) from baseline in PASI score after 12 weeks of treatment.

The present analyses strongly support the predictive validity of these diagnoses by showing that they predict both future psychopathology and enduring functional impairment. Furthermore, the present findings generally support the hierarchical developmental hypothesis in DSM-IV that some children with ODD progress to childhood-onset CD, and some youth with CD progress to antisocial personality disorder (APD). Nonetheless, they reveal that CD does not always co-occur with ODD, particularly during adolescence. Importantly, the present findings suggest that ICD-10 diagnostic criteria for ODD, which treat CD symptoms as ODD symptoms when diagnostic criteria for CD are not met, identify more functionally impaired children than the more restrictive DSM-IV definition of ODD. Filling this ""hole"" in the DSM-IV criteria for ODD should be a priority for the DSM-V.

We conducted a retrospective analysis of clinical data sets on 2,647 patients at the CORE Center, Chicago from 1997-1998 to investigate the relationship between four support services-case management (CM), transportation (TRANS), mental health (MH) and chemical dependency (CD)-and access to and retention in HIV primary care. We found that patients who received each of these services were significantly more likely to receive any care, regular care and had more visits than patients with no service, and retention increased by 15-18%. Female gender, younger age, self-pay status and IDU predicted less regular care. Need for all services was substantial and significantly greater in women. Outcomes improved to the greatest extent among patients who needed and received each service. We conclude that support services significantly increased access to and retention in HIV primary care. Our findings validate the multidisciplinary team model of HIV care, and suggest that health services that are tailored to the express needs of patients lead to better care and improved health outcomes. Further testing of changes in health care delivery to meet the rapidly changing needs of people living with HIV disease and respond to the constantly changing practice of HIV medicine is urgently needed to maintain and extend the advances in HIV care outcomes of the past decade.",2,PRIMARY,Viral Suppression,Viral load undetectable per venipuncture or medical records,Rise - Treatment Education,Control - No Treatment Education,"Rise consists of a one-month intensive intervention (with three core 60-minute counseling sessions at weeks 1, 2, and 4) followed by two booster sessions (at weeks 12 and 20).

We conducted a meta-analysis, comparing the adherence to guided iCBT with the adherence to individual face-to-face CBT.
METHODS: Studies were selected from a database of trials that investigate treatment for adult depression (see www.evidencebasedpsychotherapies.org), updated to January 2013. We identified 24 studies describing 26 treatment conditions (14 face-to-face CBT, 12 guided iCBT), by means of these inclusion criteria: targeting depressed adults, no comorbid somatic disorder or substance abuse, community recruitment, published in the year 2000 or later. The main outcome measure was the percentage of completed sessions. We also coded the percentage of treatment completers (separately coding for 100% or at least 80% of treatment completed).
RESULTS: We did not find studies that compared guided iCBT and face-to-face CBT in a single trial that met our inclusion criteria. Face-to-face CBT treatments ranged from 12 to 28 sessions, guided iCBT interventions consisted of 5 to 9 sessions. Participants in face-to-face CBT completed on average 83.9% of their treatment, which did not differ significantly from participants in guided iCBT (80.8%, P  =  .59). The percentage of completers (total intervention) was significantly higher in face-to-face CBT (84.7%) than in guided iCBT (65.1%, P < .001), as was the percentage of completers of 80% or more of the intervention (face-to-face CBT: 85.2%, guided iCBT: 67.5%, P  =  .003). Non-completers of face-to-face CBT completed on average 24.5% of their treatment, while non-completers of guided iCBT completed on average 42.1% of their treatment.
CONCLUSION: We did not find studies that compared guided iCBT and face-to-face CBT in a single trial.

DESIGN: A 12-week, multicenter, randomized, prospective, double-masked, placebo-controlled clinical trial.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged ≥18 years with use of artificial tears within 30 days, inferior corneal staining score ≥0.5 (0-4 scale), Schirmer tear test (without anesthesia) ≥1 and ≤10 mm, and eye dryness score ≥40 (0-100 visual analogue scale [VAS]).
METHODS: Subjects were randomized 1:1 after 14-day placebo run-in to lifitegrast ophthalmic solution 5.0% or placebo twice daily for 84 days.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Co-primary efficacy end points were change, from baseline to day 84, in eye dryness score (VAS, both eyes) and inferior corneal fluorescein staining score in the designated study eye. Secondary end points were change, from baseline to day 84, in ocular discomfort score (0-4 scale) in study eye, eye discomfort score (VAS), total corneal staining score in the study eye, and nasal conjunctival lissamine green staining score (0-4 scale) in the study eye. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were recorded.
RESULTS: A total of 718 subjects were randomized: placebo, n = 360; lifitegrast, n = 358 (intent-to-treat population). Lifitegrast-treated subjects experienced greater improvement in eye dryness than placebo-treated subjects (treatment effect, 12.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 8.51-16.70; P < 0.0001). There was no between-group difference in inferior corneal staining (treatment effect, 0.03; 95% CI, -0.10 to 0.17; P = 0.6186).

This study investigated whether cigarette demand predicted response to contingent monetary rewards for abstinence among individuals with substance use disorders. It also sought to replicate evidence for greater price sensitivity at whole-dollar pack price transitions (ie, left-digit effects).
METHODS: Participants (N = 338) were individuals in residential substance use disorder treatment who participated in a randomized controlled trial that compared contingent vouchers to noncontingent vouchers for smoking abstinence. Baseline demand indices were used to predict number of abstinent days during the 14-day voucher period (after the reduction lead-in) and at 1 and 3 months afterward.
RESULTS: Demand indices correlated with measures of smoking and nicotine dependence. As measured by elasticity, intensity and O max, higher demand significantly predicted fewer abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings during voucher period for individuals in the noncontingent vouchers condition. Breakpoint exhibited a trend-level association with abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings. Demand indices did not predict abstinence in the contingent vouchers group, and did not predict abstinence at 1- and 3-month follow-ups. Left-digit price transitions were associated with significantly greater reductions in consumption.
CONCLUSIONS: The association of cigarette demand with smoking behavior only in the group for whom abstinence was not incentivized indicates that CPT assesses the value of smoking more than the value of money per se and that vouchers counteract the effects of the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes. Results provide initial short-term evidence of predictive validity for the CPT indices.
IMPLICATIONS: This study provides the first evidence of the validity of the CPT for predicting early response to brief advice for smoking cessation plus nicotine replacement in smokers with substance dependence. However, demand for cigarettes did not predict voucher-based treatment response, indicating that incentives serve as a powerful motivator not to smoke that acts in opposition to the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes and that the indices reflect the value of smoking more than the value of money per se.",0,PRIMARY,Number of Participants With Relapse to Any Drug Use,No Description Available,Contingency Management (CM),Noncontingent Reinforcement (NR),"Condition provides contingent monetary reinforcement for smoking reductions (first 5 days) then for smoking abstinence (subsequent 14 days).

Patients with an expired order for screening colonoscopy might be persuaded to follow through with screening by such an intervention.
METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial of a combined reminder/outreach intervention among patients in a large general internal medicine practice. Participants included 628 patients aged 50 to 79 years with an expired order for screening colonoscopy. Patients were stratified based on receipt of any previous colorectal cancer screening and randomly assigned either to (1) an intervention group that received a mailing containing a reminder letter from their primary care physician, a brochure and digital video disc about colorectal cancer and colorectal cancer screening, and a follow-up telephone call or (2) a usual care control group. The primary outcome was receipt of fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy within 3 months of randomization. Screening outcomes were observed for an additional 3 months (6 months from randomization).
RESULTS: Screening rates at 3 months were 9.9% (31 of 314 patients) in the intervention group and 3.2% (10 of 314 patients) in the control group (rate ratio, 3.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-6.2; P = .001). At 6 months, rates were 18.2% (57 of 314 patients) and 12.1% (38 of 314 patients), respectively (rate ratio, 1.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-2.2; P = .03).

Modulated electro-hyperthermia (mEHT, trade-name: oncothermia) represents a significant technological advancement in the hyperthermia field, allowing the autofocusing of electromagnetic power on a cell membrane to generate massive apoptosis. This approach turns local immunogenic cancer cell death (apoptosis) into a systemic anti-tumor immune response and may be implemented by treatment with intratumoral DCs.
METHODS: The CT26 murine colorectal cancer model was used in this investigation. The inhibition of growth of the tumor and the systemic anti-tumor immune response were measured. The tumor was heated to a core temperature of 42 °C for 30 min. The matured synergetic DCs were intratumorally injected 24 h following mEHT was applied.
RESULTS: mEHT induced significant apoptosis and enhanced the release of heat shock protein70 (Hsp70) in CT26 tumors. Treatment with mEHT-DCs significantly inhibited CT26 tumor growth, relative to DCs alone or mEHT alone. The secondary tumor protection effect upon rechallenging was observed in mice that were treated with mEHT-DCs. Immunohistochemical staining of CD45 and F4/80 revealed that mEHT-DC treatment increased the number of leukocytes and macrophages. Most interestingly, mEHT also induced infiltrations of eosinophil, which has recently been reported to be an orchestrator of a specific T cell response. Cytotoxic T cell assay and ELISpot assay revealed a tumor-specific T cell activity.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that mEHT induces tumor cell apoptosis and enhances the release of Hsp70 from heated tumor cells, unlike conventional hyperthermia. mEHT can create a favorable tumor microenvironment for an immunological chain reaction that improves the success rate of intratumoral DC immunotherapy.",2,PRIMARY,Objective Response Rate (ORR),"Objective Response Rate (ORR) = Complete Remission (CR) + Partial Remission (PR)

Adults (study 1, n=383; study 2, n=390) meeting DSM-IV-TR BED criteria were randomized (1:1) to placebo or LDX (50 or 70 mg/day) dose titration; optimized doses were maintained to the end of double-blind treatment (week 12/early termination). Change from baseline in binge eating days/week at weeks 11-12 (primary efficacy endpoint) was assessed with mixed-effects models for repeated measures. Secondary endpoints related to binge eating and medical parameters, safety, and treatment compliance were also assessed. Least squares mean (95% CI) treatment differences for change from baseline binge eating days/week at weeks 11-12 significantly favored LDX (study 1: -1.35 [-1.70, -1.01]; study 2: -1.66 [-2.04, -1.28]; both P<0.001). In both studies, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported by ⩾10% of LDX participants were dry mouth, insomnia, and headache. Serious TEAEs occurred in two (1.1%) placebo participants in each study and in three (1.6%) and one (0.6%) LDX participants in study 1 and study 2, respectively.

OBJECTIVE: To provide evidence-based outline of modifiable risk factors and give an example of a multidisciplinary protocol with the goal of improving outcomes.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Protocol-based care has been shown to improve outcomes in many areas of medicine. A protocol to evaluate patients undergoing high-risk procedures may ultimately improve patient outcomes.
METHODS: The English language literature to date was reviewed on modifiable risk factors for spine surgery. A multidisciplinary team including hospitalists, critical care physicians, anesthesiologists, and spine surgeons from neurosurgery and orthopedics established an institutional protocol to provide comprehensive care in the pre-, peri-, and postoperative periods for patients undergoing high-risk spine operations.
RESULTS: An example of a comprehensive pre-, peri-, and postoperative high-risk spine protocol is provided, with focus on the preoperative assessment of patients undergoing high-risk spine operations and modifiable risk factors.
CONCLUSION: Standardizing preoperative risk assessment may lead to better outcomes after major spine operations. A high-risk spine protocol may help patients by having dedicated physicians in multiple specialties focusing on all aspects of a patients care in the pre-, intra-, and postoperative phases.",2,PRIMARY,Total Red Blood Cells Transfused in the Intraoperative Period,Total red blood cells transfused in the intraoperative period in (mL).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with ES-SCLC, stratified by sex and serum lactate dehydrogenase levels, were randomly assigned to receive four 3-week cycles of CE (75 mg/m
RESULTS: A total of 128 eligible patients received treatment on protocol. The median age was 66 years, 52% of patients were men, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was 0 for 29% of patients and 1 for 71%. The respective median PFS for the CE+V arm versus the CE+P arm was 6.1 versus 5.5 months (unstratified hazard ratio [HR], 0.75 [one-sided P = .06]; stratified HR, 0.63 [one-sided P = .01]), favoring CE+V.

Because of pro-healing constituents, we hypothesized that fibrin sealant (FS) can reduce inflammation and augment soft tissue healing within the damaged or degenerative IVD. To test this, human and porcine nucleus pulposus (NP) and annulus fibrosus (AF) cells were extracted from tissues and encapsulated into alginate beads (NP cells) and type I collagen sponges (AF cells). Half of the alginate and collagen scaffolds were embedded in FS. To provoke inflammatory behaviours, the constructs were cultured with and without continuous IL-1α (10 ng/ml) for 4, 7 and 14 days. ELISA was used to quantify the cellular synthesis (ng/µg DNA) of clinically relevant cytokines, proteolytic enzymes and growth factors. In NP cell constructs with IL-1α, the syntheses of TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 was elevated at all culture durations. In the presence of FS, secretion of several pro-inflammatory cytokines were significantly reduced [IL-6 and IL-8 (porcine); and TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 (human)]. Consistent with these reductions, human NP cultures exposed to FS and FS + IL-1α synthesized significantly reduced amounts of MMP-1 and -3 compared to constructs with IL-1α. For porcine and human AF cells, there were no significant differences in the synthesis of the inflammatory or proteolytic cytokines relative to controls (without IL-1α) at any culture duration. However, the porcine AF cells exposed to FS synthesized elevated amounts of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a randomized, controlled, clinical trial in which participants all received an 18-month, group-based behavioral obesity treatment and were randomized to individual sessions of motivational interviewing or attention control (total of five sessions) as an adjunct to the weight control program. Overweight women with type 2 diabetes treated by oral medications who could walk for exercise were eligible. Primary outcomes were weight and A1C, assessed at 0, 6, 12, and 18 months.
RESULTS: A total of 217 overweight women (38% African American) were randomized (93% retention rate). Women in motivational interviewing lost significantly more weight at 6 months (P = 0.01) and 18 months (P = 0.04). Increased weight losses with motivational interviewing were mediated by enhanced adherence to the behavioral weight control program.

Whether adults with obesity can achieve weight loss with once-weekly semaglutide at a dose of 2.4 mg as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention has not been confirmed.
METHODS: In this double-blind trial, we enrolled 1961 adults with a body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 30 or greater (≥27 in persons with ≥1 weight-related coexisting condition), who did not have diabetes, and randomly assigned them, in a 2:1 ratio, to 68 weeks of treatment with once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide (at a dose of 2.4 mg) or placebo, plus lifestyle intervention. The coprimary end points were the percentage change in body weight and weight reduction of at least 5%. The primary estimand (a precise description of the treatment effect reflecting the objective of the clinical trial) assessed effects regardless of treatment discontinuation or rescue interventions.
RESULTS: The mean change in body weight from baseline to week 68 was -14.9% in the semaglutide group as compared with -2.4% with placebo, for an estimated treatment difference of -12.4 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], -13.4 to -11.5; P<0.001). More participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group achieved weight reductions of 5% or more (1047 participants [86.4%] vs. 182 [31.5%]), 10% or more (838 [69.1%] vs. 69 [12.0%]), and 15% or more (612 [50.5%] vs. 28 [4.9%]) at week 68 (P<0.001 for all three comparisons of odds). The change in body weight from baseline to week 68 was -15.3 kg in the semaglutide group as compared with -2.6 kg in the placebo group (estimated treatment difference, -12.7 kg; 95% CI, -13.7 to -11.7). Participants who received semaglutide had a greater improvement with respect to cardiometabolic risk factors and a greater increase in participant-reported physical functioning from baseline than those who received placebo. Nausea and diarrhea were the most common adverse events with semaglutide; they were typically transient and mild-to-moderate in severity and subsided with time. More participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group discontinued treatment owing to gastrointestinal events (59 [4.5%] vs. 5 [0.8%]).

Little research has been conducted on ways to reduce the difficulty and failure, and enhance the ease and success, of IV insertion. We conducted this study to determine variables associated with IV insertion difficulty, failure, and success, and to learn special techniques nurses use to facilitate IV insertion.
METHODS: Data were collected on 339 IV insertions in hospitalized patients by 34 registered nurses. The data included information about the nurse (eg, age, education, and self-rated IV insertion skill); the patient (eg, age and race); the IV (eg, site, gauge, and type); and the IV insertion, (eg, duration and difficulty). Data were analyzed to determine the effects of these variables on IV insertion outcome. In addition, nurses were asked to describe special techniques they used to facilitate IV insertion.
RESULTS: A total of 77% of the IV insertions were successful. Nurses who were older, had more years of experience, were certified in a specialty, and rated themselves higher in insertion skill had significantly more successful insertions than their younger and less-experienced and less-skilled counterparts (P < .001). Successful IV insertions were significantly faster (mean 32 seconds) than unsuccessful ones (mean 66 seconds) (P < .001), and were rated as significantly less difficult (P < .001). Failed IV insertions were associated with higher degrees of difficulty arising from vein variables, such as vein rolled or vein was resistant to puncture, and patient variables, such as tough or dark skin and patient movement. The nurses described a wide variety of techniques to facilitate insertion success. The most frequently mentioned were getting self and patient in a comfortable position, using mechanical stimulation such as tapping the vein, and stabilizing the vein.
CONCLUSION: Approximately one fourth of the 339 IV insertions in this study were unsuccessful. Repeated insertion attempts are painful and costly. This study identified nurse, patient, and IV variables associated with IV insertion success and failure.

METHODS: A single 50 mg dose of dapagliflozin was used to assess pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in five groups: healthy non-diabetic subjects; patients with T2DM and normal kidney function and patients with T2DM and mild, moderate or severe renal impairment based on estimated creatinine clearance. Subsequently, 20 mg once daily multiple doses of dapagliflozin were evaluated in the patients with T2DM. Formation rates of dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide (D3OG), an inactive metabolite, were evaluated using human isolated kidney and liver microsomes.
RESULTS: Plasma concentrations of dapagliflozin and D3OG were incrementally increased with declining kidney function. Steady-state Cmax for dapagliflozin were 4%, 6% and 9% higher and for D3OG were 20%, 37% and 52% higher in patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, respectively, compared with normal function. AUC(0,τ) was likewise higher. D3OG formation in kidney microsomes was three-fold higher than in liver microsomes and 109-fold higher than in intestine microsomes.

We assessed the effects of early administration of a short course of tranexamic acid on death, vascular occlusive events, and the receipt of blood transfusion in trauma patients.
METHODS: This randomised controlled trial was undertaken in 274 hospitals in 40 countries. 20 211 adult trauma patients with, or at risk of, significant bleeding were randomly assigned within 8 h of injury to either tranexamic acid (loading dose 1 g over 10 min then infusion of 1 g over 8 h) or matching placebo. Randomisation was balanced by centre, with an allocation sequence based on a block size of eight, generated with a computer random number generator. Both participants and study staff (site investigators and trial coordinating centre staff) were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was death in hospital within 4 weeks of injury, and was described with the following categories: bleeding, vascular occlusion (myocardial infarction, stroke and pulmonary embolism), multiorgan failure, head injury, and other.

5126,NCT00005957,Breast Radiation Plus Regional Radiation is superior or other to Standard Breast Irradiation in terms of Overall Survival 10 years,26200977,Regional Nodal Irradiation in Early-Stage Breast Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Most women with breast cancer who undergo breast-conserving surgery receive whole-breast irradiation. We examined whether the addition of regional nodal irradiation to whole-breast irradiation improved outcomes.
METHODS: We randomly assigned women with node-positive or high-risk node-negative breast cancer who were treated with breast-conserving surgery and adjuvant systemic therapy to undergo either whole-breast irradiation plus regional nodal irradiation (including internal mammary, supraclavicular, and axillary lymph nodes) (nodal-irradiation group) or whole-breast irradiation alone (control group). The primary outcome was overall survival. Secondary outcomes were disease-free survival, isolated locoregional disease-free survival, and distant disease-free survival.
RESULTS: Between March 2000 and February 2007, a total of 1832 women were assigned to the nodal-irradiation group or the control group (916 women in each group). The median follow-up was 9.5 years. At the 10-year follow-up, there was no significant between-group difference in survival, with a rate of 82.8% in the nodal-irradiation group and 81.8% in the control group (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72 to 1.13; P=0.38). The rates of disease-free survival were 82.0% in the nodal-irradiation group and 77.0% in the control group (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.94; P=0.01). Patients in the nodal-irradiation group had higher rates of grade 2 or greater acute pneumonitis (1.2% vs. 0.2%, P=0.01) and lymphedema (8.4% vs. 4.5%, P=0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Among women with node-positive or high-risk node-negative breast cancer, the addition of regional nodal irradiation to whole-breast irradiation did not improve overall survival but reduced the rate of breast-cancer recurrence.

We report results of 24 dyadic qualitative interviews (N=48), conducted in Los Angeles, CA, exploring how YBMSM and their friends view PrEP and PEP. Interviews were analyzed using a grounded theory approach. Participants had widely divergent levels of knowledge about these prevention methods. Misconceptions and mistrust regarding PrEP were common, and concerns were expressed about PrEP-related stigma and the potential for gossip among peers who might assume a person on PrEP was HIV-positive. Yet participants also framed PrEP and PEP as valuable new options within an expanded ""tool kit"" of HIV prevention strategies that created possibilities for preventing new HIV infections, dating men with a different HIV status, and decreased anxiety about exposure to HIV. We organized themes around four main areas: (1) information and misinformation about biomedical HIV prevention; (2) expectations about PrEP, sexual behavior, and stigma; (3) gossip, disclosure, and ""spreading the word"" about PrEP and PEP; and (4) the roles of PrEP and PEP in an expanded HIV prevention tool kit.

Quite often the data for each patient may be effectively summarized by a pre-treatment mean and a post-treatment mean. Analysis of covariance is the method of choice and its superiority over analysis of post-treatment means or analysis of mean changes is quantified, as regards both reduced variance and avoidance of bias, using a simple model for the covariance structure between time points. Quantitative consideration is also given to practical issues in the design of repeated measures studies: the merits of having more than one pre-treatment measurement are demonstrated, and methods for determining sample sizes in repeated measures designs are provided. Several examples from clinical trials are presented, and broad practical recommendations are made. The examples support the value of the compound symmetry assumption as a realistic simplification in quantitative planning of repeated measures trials. The analysis using summary statistics makes no such assumption.

This study assessed the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin monotherapy in Japanese T2DM patients with inadequate glycaemic control.
METHODS: Patients (n = 279) were randomized to receive dapagliflozin (1, 2.5, 5 or 10 mg/day) or placebo once daily for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at week 12. Secondary endpoints included change from baseline in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and proportion of patients achieving HbA1c <7.0% at week 12.
RESULTS: Significant reductions in HbA1c were seen with all dapagliflozin doses (-0.11 to -0.44%) versus placebo (+0.37%). Reductions were also observed in FPG with dapagliflozin (-0.87 to -1.77 mmol/l [-15.61 to -31.94 mg/dl]) versus placebo (+0.62 mmol/l [+11.17 mg/dl]).

METHODS: We performed 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. In healthy volunteers (20 per group), we evaluated the effects of oral placebo, 500 mg, or 1000 mg of CDC (delayed-release, each given for 4 days) on gastrointestinal and colonic transit. A second trial compared the effects of colesevelam (1.875 g, twice daily) versus placebo in 24 patients (12 per group) with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) on transit, daily bowel frequency and consistency, and colonic mucosal permeability. Serum fasting 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (7alphaC4) was measured to screen for bile acid malabsorption.

The current analysis conceptualizes social and psychological determinants of adherence to HAART among HIV-positive individuals. The authors propose an information-motivation-behavioral skills (IMB) model of HAART adherence that assumes that adherence-related information, motivation, and behavioral skills are fundamental determinants of adherence to HAART. According to the model, adherence-related information and motivation work through adherence-related behavioral skills to affect adherence to HAART.

Consequently, a trial of extracranial-to-intracranial (EC/IC) arterial bypass for these patients was proposed. The purpose of this study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of using PET in identifying candidates for EC/IC bypass.
METHODS: A Markov model was created to estimate the cost-effectiveness of PET screening and treating a cohort of 45 symptomatic patients with carotid occlusion. The primary outcome was incremental cost for PET screening and EC/IC bypass (if OEF was elevated) per incremental quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved. Rates of stroke and death with surgical and medical treatment were obtained from EC/IC Bypass Trial and STLCOS data. Costs were estimated from the literature. Sensitivity analyses were performed for all assumed variables, including the PET OEF threshold used to select patients for surgery.
RESULTS: In the base case, PET screening of the cohort followed by EC/IC bypass on 36 of the 45 patients yielded 23.2 additional QALYs at a cost of $20,000 per QALY, compared with medical therapy alone. A more specific PET threshold, which identified 18 surgical candidates, gained 22.6 QALYs at less cost than medical therapy alone. The results were sensitive to the perioperative stroke rate and the stroke risk reduction conferred by EC/IC bypass surgery.
CONCLUSION: If postoperative stroke rates are similar to stroke rates observed in the EC/IC Bypass Trial, EC/IC bypass will be cost-effective in patients with symptomatic carotid occlusion who have increased OEF. A clinical trial of medical therapy versus PET followed by EC/IC bypass (if OEF is elevated) is warranted.",2,PRIMARY,Surgical Group:Ipsilateral Ischemic Stroke in 2 Yrs From Randomization and All Stroke & Death Through 30d Post-surgery; Non-surgical Group:Ipsilateral Ischemic Stroke in 2 Yrs From Randomization and All Stroke & Death Through 30d Post-randomization,2 yr Kaplan-Meier estimates of the proportions.Proportions expressed as percentages for reporting purposes.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the reach, implementation, and efficacy of a 6-month lifestyle program implemented in primary care by nurse practitioners (NPs) for adults at risk of type 2 diabetes.
METHODS: The NP sites (n = 4) were randomized to an enhanced standard care program (one NP and one nutrition session) or a lifestyle program (enhanced standard care and six NP sessions). These NPs recruited adults at risk of diabetes from their practice (n = 58), with an acceptance rate of 70%.
RESULTS: The program reached a diverse, obese, and moderately low income sample. The NPs were able to successfully implement the protocols. The average length of the program was 9.3 months. Attendance was high (98%), and attrition was low (12%). The NPs were able to adopt the educational, behavioral, and psychosocial strategies of the intervention easily.

Gathering the best possible medication history (BPMH) is necessary to accurately identify each medication for multimorbid older adults. The objective was to describe a multipronged approach to obtaining the BPMH for hospitalized older adults, quantify the medication discrepancies identified through these sources, and explore factors associated with these discrepancies.
METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of 372 hospitalized older adults (age ≥ 50) transitioning to post-acute care as part of a randomized controlled trial to reduce medication burden. We used four information sources to yield a BPMH. Medication discrepancies at hospital admission were categorized as omissions, additions, and dose discrepancies after comparing alternate sources with the electronic medical record (EMR). Multivariate regression analysis, including patient factors (e.g., age, prehospital medication count, number of pharmacies), was performed to identify factors associated with the total count of medication discrepancies.
RESULTS: Ninety percent of participants had at least one medication discrepancy and 46% used more than one pharmacy. The majority of discrepancies were omissions. Among the entire cohort, there was a median of two omitted medications per patient across two alternate sources-pharmacy refill history and bedside interview. Lower age, greater total number of prehospital medications, and admission from assisted living or skilled nursing facility were significantly associated with greater medication discrepancies.
CONCLUSION: A multipronged and consistent approach to obtain a BPMH during hospitalization for multimorbid older adults revealed medication discrepancies that should be addressed prior to hospital discharge to support safe prescribing practices.",2,PRIMARY,Total Number of Medications,The number of medications a participant is taking.

Corticosteroid replacement is beneficial in patients with septic shock and adrenal dysfunction. The goal of this study was to assess baseline cortisol and adrenal reserve of out-of-hospital circulatory arrest patients after recovery of spontaneous circulation. Thirty-three consecutive patients successfully resuscitated after cardiac arrest were prospectively included between March 2002 and June 2003. A serum cortisol assay and a corticotropin test (250 microg i.v.) were done 6 to 36 h after circulatory arrest. A cortisol increase smaller than 9 microg/dL after corticotropin (nonresponders) defined adrenal reserve insufficiency. Response status was compared in the three outcome groups: survival with full neurologic recovery (n = 4), early death from refractory shock (n = 10), or later death from neurologic dysfunction (n = 19). Patients who died of early refractory shock had lower baseline cortisol levels than patients who died of neurologic dysfunction (27 microg/dL [15-47] vs. 52 microg/dL [28-73], respectively; P < 0.01), suggesting an inadequate adrenal response to severe systemic inflammation. Corticotropin response status was not associated with standard severity markers and seemed uninfluenced by therapeutic hypothermia. In conclusion, patients who die of early refractory shock after cardiopulmonary resuscitation may have an inadequate adrenal response to the stress associated with this condition.

METHODS: In our randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we enrolled adults (≥18 years) at 174 university hospitals in 31 countries worldwide. Eligible patients had to have non-refractory multiple myeloma that previously responded to treatment (one to three regimens) but were currently progressing, ECOG performance statuses of 2 or less, and no continuing toxic effects from previous treatment. We excluded patients with known resistance to bortezomib. We randomly allocated patients (1:1) using an interactive voice response system to receive 21 day cycles of bortezomib (1·3 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1, 4, 8, and 11) in combination with oral vorinostat (400 mg) or matching placebo once-daily on days 1-14. We stratified patients by baseline tumour stage (International Staging System stage 1 or stage ≥2), previous bone-marrow transplantation (yes or no), and number of previous regimens (1 or ≥2). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) in the intention-to-treat population. We assessed adverse events in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number 00773747.
FINDINGS: Between Dec 24, 2008, and Sept 8, 2011, we randomly allocated 317 eligible patients to the vorinostat group (315 of whom received at least one dose) and 320 to the placebo group (all of whom received at least one dose). Median PFS was 7·63 months (95% CI 6·87-8·40) in the vorinostat group and 6·83 months (5·67-7·73) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·77, 95% CI 0·64-0·94; p=0·0100). 312 (99%) of 315 patients in the vorinostat group and 315 (98%) of 320 patients in the placebo group had adverse events (300 [95%] adverse events in the vorinostat group and 282 [88%] in the control group were regarded as related to treatment). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were thrombocytopenia (143 [45%] patients in the vorinostat group vs 77 [24%] patients in the placebo group), neutropenia (89 [28%] vs 80 [25%]), and anaemia (53 [17%] vs 40 [13%]).
INTERPRETATION: Although the combination of vorinostat and bortezomib prolonged PFS relative to bortezomib and placebo, the clinical relevance of the difference in PFS between the two groups is not clear. Different treatment schedules of bortezomib and vorinostat might improve tolerability and enhance activity.

Averaged ST waveforms were plotted at 5-minute intervals in six fetuses for 2 to 22 days. No diurnal or other rhythms were seen. To correct for changes in signal gain the amplitude of the T wave was measured relative to the amplitude of the QRS complex. The T/QRS ratio was normally less than 0.30. Persistently elevated ST waveforms with a T/QRS range 0.32 to 0.65 preceded fetal death by some days in three fetuses and were associated with anemia and/or hypotension in a further three. In these animals hypoxia produced a further rise in the ST waveform (mean T/QRS, from 0.48 to 0.81) and all died during labor. In lambs with a normal ST waveform there were differences in the response to hypoxia over 1 hour for a similar fall in PO2. In eight experiments the ST segment and T wave increased (mean T/QRS, from 0.17 to 0.59) and promptly reverted to normal with normoxia. There was a significant rise in mean arterial blood pressure, plasma lactate, and glucose and a fall in pH. In four experiments there was little change (mean T/QRS, from 0.19 to 0.25), with a small rise in plasma lactate suggesting that these lambs were able to maintain aerobic myocardial metabolism. Overall there was a strong correlation of the T/QRS ratio to the rate of rise of lactate. These findings complement previous results in the acute fetal lamb preparation and suggest that ST waveform elevation expressed as the T/QRS ratio identifies a change to anerobic myocardial metabolism.",2,PRIMARY,Number of Infants With Apgar Score < = 3 at 5 Minutes (Primary Outcome Component),"The Apgar score is a simple method of quickly assessing the health and vital signs of a newborn baby created by and named after Dr. Virginia Apgar.

The purpose of this study was to compare a new mobile compression device with low-molecular-weight heparin with regard to their safety and effectiveness for the prevention of venous thromboembolic disease.
METHODS: Patients who had a total hip arthroplasty were randomized to receive prophylaxis with a mobile compression device or low-molecular-weight heparin for ten days. Use of the compression device began intraoperatively, and the patients in this group could receive 81 mg of aspirin daily after the surgery. The first injection of the low-molecular-weight heparin began between twelve and twenty-four hours after the surgery. After ten to twelve days, all patients underwent bilateral lower-extremity duplex ultrasonography to screen for deep venous thrombi in the calf and thigh. Any clinical symptoms of pulmonary embolism were evaluated with spiral computed tomography lung scans. Bleeding events and utilization of (i.e., compliance with) prophylactic treatment in both groups were documented. Clinical evaluation to look for evidence of deep venous thrombi and pulmonary emboli was performed at twelve weeks postoperatively.
RESULTS: Four hundred and ten patients (414 hips) were randomized; 392 of these patients (395 of the hips) were evaluable with regard to the safety of the intervention and 386 patients (389 hips) were evaluable with regard to its efficacy. Demographics were similar clinically between the groups. The rate of major bleeding events was 0% in the compression group and 6% in the low-molecular-weight heparin group. The rates of distal and proximal deep venous thrombosis were 3% and 2%, respectively, in the compression group compared with 3% and 1% in the heparin group. The rates of pulmonary embolism were 1% in the compression group and 1% in the heparin group, and there were no fatal pulmonary emboli.

They were randomized to either standard of care (SOC) passive referral or case management (CM) for linkage to nearby HIV clinics. The SOC arm received information about HIV and local care resources; the CM intervention arm included up to five contacts with a case manager over a 90-day period. The outcome measure was self-reported attendance at an HIV care clinic at least twice over a 12-month period.
RESULTS: A higher proportion of the 136 case-managed participants than the 137 SOC participants visited an HIV clinician at least once within 6 months [78 versus 60%; adjusted relative risk (RR(adj)), 1.36; P = 0.0005) and at least twice within 12 months (64 versus 49%; RR(adj), 1.41; P = 0.006).

We assessed intensification of medical therapy over time, comparing the management of hyperglycaemia, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia.
METHODS: Prospective cohort study of 598 adults with Type 2 diabetes receiving primary care in an academic medical centre from May 1997 to April 1999. We assessed whether patients failing to achieve standard treatment goals for haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), systolic blood pressure (SBP), or low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol when last measured during 12 months (Year 1, 5/97-4/98) had increases in their corresponding medical regimen during the following 12 months (Year 2, 5/98-4/99).
RESULTS: Among untreated patients in Year 1, seven of 12 (58%) of those above goal for HbA1c were initiated on medical therapy in Year 2, compared with 16 of 48 (34%) above SBP goal (P=0.02) and 26 of 115 (23%) above LDL cholesterol goal (P=0.02). Among patients on therapy and above goal, 124 of 244 (51%) patients with elevated HbA1c had their regimen increased in Year 2, compared with 85 of 282 (30%) with elevated SBP (P<0.001) and 22 of 79 (30%) with elevated LDL cholesterol (P<0.001). From Year 1 to Year 2 there was a decline in the overall proportion of patients above goal for LDL cholesterol (from 58% to 45%, P=0.002) but not for HbA1c or blood pressure.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility and efficacy of a fiberoptic probe containing novel polarization gating spectroscopy technology to identify patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAC) by the field effect theory.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort (pilot) study.
SETTING: Outpatient tertiary care center.
PATIENTS: Adult (≥ 18 years) patients undergoing EGD-EUS were screened. Patients with PAC were included in the ""cancer"" group and patients without PAC were included in the ""control"" group. We excluded patients with other known malignancies and gastroduodenal premalignant lesions.
INTERVENTIONS AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Spectroscopic measurements of EIBS variables, such as deoxyhemoglobin concentration (DHb) and mean blood vessel radius (BVR), were obtained from 5 periampullary locations. The Mann-Whitney rank sum test was used for the statistical analysis (P ≤ .05).
RESULTS: Fourteen patients (mean age 72 years, 79% male) in the cancer group and 15 patients (mean age 63 years, 60% male) in the control group were included in the final analysis. At the ampullary site, both DHb (P = .001) and BVR (P = .03) were higher in PAC patients than in the control subjects.

These family supporters are an important resource who could be leveraged to improve patients' engagement in their care and patient health outcomes. However, healthcare teams lack structured and feasible approaches to effectively engage family supporters in patient self-management support. This trial tests a strategy to strengthen the capacity of family supporters to help adults with high-risk diabetes engage in healthcare, successfully enact care plans, and lower risk of diabetes complications.
METHODS/DESIGN: We will conduct a randomized trial evaluating the CO-IMPACT (Caring Others Increasing EnageMent in Patient Aligned Care Teams) intervention. Two hunded forty adults with diabetes who are at high risk for diabetes complications due to poor glycemic control or high blood pressure will be randomized, along with a family supporter (living either with the patient or remotely), to CO-IMPACT or enhanced usual primary care for 12 months. CO-IMPACT provides patient-supporter dyads: it provides one coaching session addressing supporter techniques for helping patients with behavior change motivation, action planning, and proactive communication with healthcare providers; biweekly automated phone calls to prompt dyad action on new patient health concerns; phone calls to prompt preparation for patients' primary care visits; and primary care visit summaries sent to both patient and supporter. Primary outcomes are changes in patient activation, as measured by the Patient Activation Measure-13, and change in 5-year cardiac event risk, as measured by the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study cardiac risk score for people with diabetes. Secondary outcomes include patients' diabetes self-management behaviors, diabetes distress, and glycemic and blood pressure control. Measures among supporters will include use of effective support techniques, burden, and distress about patient's diabetes care.
DISCUSSION: If effective in improving patient activation and diabetes management, CO-IMPACT will provide healthcare teams with evidence-based tools and techniques to engage patients' available family or friends in supporting patient self-management, even if they live remotely. The core skills addressed by CO-IMPACT can be used by patients and their supporters over time to respond to changing patient health needs and priorities.

AIMS: To determine whether hyaluronic acid (HA) microdroplet placement into the dorsal hands has an impact on skin physiology and clinical appearance and whether there is any difference between stabilized HA (S-HA) and nonstabilized HA (NS-HA).
PATIENTS/METHODS: The intra-individual comparison in 15 volunteers involved injection sessions at week 0, 4, and 8 with random assignment of left and right hand to either S-HA or NS-HA. Skin physiology parameters cutaneous elasticity, surface roughness, hydration, and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) were measured in vivo at weeks 0 (before treatment), 4 (before subsequent treatment), 12, and 24. Clinical hand assessment was carried out at weeks 0 and 12 by a blinded dermatologist.
RESULTS: Intradermal injection of S-HA generated significant improvement in skin elasticity and surface roughness at week 12 compared to baseline. On the hands treated with NS-HA, there was a trend for improvement (not significant). While there was no significant difference in hydration and TEWL between both hands before treatment, at week 12 hands treated with S-HA displayed a significantly higher hydration level and lower TEWL compared to NS-HA treatment. Clinically S-HA proved to be significantly superior to NS-HA. At week 24 the observed effects started to return back toward baseline, with S-HA treatment still offering better results compared to the NS-HA.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 270 patients were randomly assigned to receive intravenous paclitaxel 225 mg/m2 plus intravenous carboplatin at area under curve 6 (AUC 6) on day 1 of a 21-day cycle followed by either placebo (n = 135) or oral sorafenib 400 mg (n = 135) twice daily on days 2 to 19. The primary efficacy end point was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary and tertiary end points included overall survival and incidence of best response, respectively.
RESULTS: The median PFS was 17.9 weeks for the placebo plus CP arm and 17.4 weeks for the sorafenib plus CP arm (hazard ratio, 0.91; 99% CI, 0.63 to 1.31; two-sided log-rank test P = .49). Response rate was 11% with placebo versus 12% with sorafenib.

However, data regarding the symptoms noted in DSM-IV and timing of their expression in the menstrual cycle have had little empirical support.
OBJECTIVE: To provide evidence informing the definitional criteria for PMDD.
DESIGN: Prospective surveys.
SETTING: General community and clinical settings.
PARTICIPANTS: Two cohorts that included a representative sample and a self-identified treatment-seeking cohort. Main Outcome Measure  Daily ratings of perimenstrual symptoms and functioning.
RESULTS: Mood and physical symptoms were most severe and were accompanied by impairment in the 4 days before through the first 2 days of menses for the self-identified group and in the 3 days before through the first 3 days of menses in the community sample. The most problematic symptoms endorsed were those listed in DSM-IV, but depressed mood was less frequent than other affective symptoms. In the combined sample, 4 or more symptoms was the optimal cutoff point for maximizing both sensitivity and specificity when predicting impairment.
CONCLUSIONS: This is informative for DSM-5 in that the most symptomatic period typically includes the few days before through the first 3 days of menses rather than only the premenstrual phase. Further, we validated the salience of PMDD symptoms included in DSM-IV.

Instability of bone fragments pre-disposes a patient to have non-union, mal-union and can subsequently lead to deep sternal wound infections progressing to mediastinitis. Rigid plate fixation has been utilized for acquired and surgically created fractures of virtually every bone in the body to prevent instability. However, the current standard for sternotomy closure remains the method of wire-circlage. Application of rigid plate fixation for sternal osteotomies affords greater stability of the sternum. We report on our preliminary experience with this technique in high-risk patients.
METHODS: From July of 2000 to December 2001, rigid plate fixation was applied to 45 patients designated as having high risk for sternal dehiscence and subsequent mediastinitis. High risk was defined as patients having 3 or more established historical risk factors, including: COPD, Re-Operative Surgery, Renal Failure, Diabetes, Chronic Steroid Use, Morbid Obesity, Concurrent Infection and Acquired or Iatrogenic Immunosuppression. Intra-operative risk factors included off-midline sternotomy, osteoporosis, long cardio-pulmonary bypass runs (>2 h), transverse fractures of the sternum. Rigid plate fixation was performed using a combination of plates secured by bi-cortical screws, after the cardiac surgical procedure was complete and hemostasis was secured.
RESULTS: Rigid plate fixation was performed on 26 males and 19 females. The average age of patients was 63 (43-88) years. The average follow-up was 15 weeks (range 8-41 weeks). While there were 4 peri-operative deaths unrelated to sternal closure: one from aspiration pneumonia (post-operative day 9), one from a pulmonary embolus (post-operative day 29), one from overwhelming sepsis from pre-existing endocarditis (post-operative day 15), and one for primary respiratory failure (post-operative day 12). All others healed successfully. One patient who had a sterile dehiscence subsequently underwent successful re-operative rigid fixation. Comparing the cohort of patients who received rigid plate fixation to a matched population of high-risk patients during a similar time period who received wire closure, revealed a significant difference in the incidence of post-operative mediastinitis. The wire closed group (n = 207) had 18 deaths unrelated to sternal closure and had 28 patients who developed mediastinitis (14.8%). The rigid plate fixation group had no mediastinitis (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.006). The total incidence of post-operative mediastinitis during the designated study period was 4.2%.

METHODS: A pilot, unblinded, randomized clinical trial of 40 children with persistent asthma, stratified by age and randomized 1:1, recruited from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh, PA) was conducted. All participants received asthma action plans and Air Quality Index education. The intervention group received printed Air Quality Index information and showed the ability to use AirNow. Asthma exacerbations were assessed through a questionnaire, asthma control was assessed with the Asthma Control Test and Childhood Asthma Control Test, and quality of life was assessed with the Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire. After randomization (July-October 2020), participants were followed monthly for 6 months (exit January-March 2021). Outcome differences between groups were evaluated at the exit visit and over time (analysis was in 2021).
RESULTS: At randomization, there were no significant differences in age, sex, race, or asthma severity. At exit, more intervention participants checked the Air Quality Index (63% vs 15%) with no differences in the proportion of asthma exacerbations or mean Childhood Asthma Control Test or Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire scores. The mean change in Asthma Control Test score was higher in the intervention group (change in Asthma Control Test=2.00 vs 0.15 for the control), which was modified by time (β=1.85, CI=0.09, 3.61). Physical activity was decreased overall and showed modification by treatment and time.

A better understanding of social and cognitive determinants of parents' injury prevention behavior and the identification of potential subgroups for targeted message delivery could advance the effectiveness of educational and behavioral interventions. This study assessed the degree to which parents' injury prevention behavior is associated with theoretical determinants and examined whether this relation differs by age or birth order of child.
DESIGN: Cross sectional observational study.
SETTING: Three Midwestern pediatric clinics.
SUBJECTS: 594 parents of children ages 0-4 attending routine well child visits.
MEASURES: Injury prevention attitudes, beliefs, and practices.
RESULTS: Overall, only modest relations were observed between injury beliefs and attitudes and injury prevention behaviors. However, these relations differed substantially by child age and birth order, with stronger associations observed for parents of older first born children. Outcome expectations and social norms were more strongly related to injury prevention behavior among parents of preschool children than among parents of infants and toddlers, while attitudes were more predictive for parents of first born children than parents of later born children.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the complexity of relations between theorized determinants and behavior, and suggest the potential utility of using audience segmentation strategies in behavioral interventions addressing injury prevention.",2,PRIMARY,Enrollment in Smoking Cessation Program,Enrollment records from the union-sponsored smoking cessation program,Intervention Group,Control Group,"Targeted messaging

METHODS: This 9-week, head-to-head, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study (SPD489-317; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01106430) enrolled patients (aged 6-17 years) with at least moderately symptomatic ADHD and an inadequate response to previous MPH therapy. Patients were randomized (1:1) to an optimized daily dose of LDX (30, 50 or 70 mg) or ATX (patients <70 kg, 0.5-1.2 mg/kg with total daily dose not to exceed 1.4 mg/kg; patients ≥70 kg, 40, 80 or 100 mg). The primary efficacy outcome was time (days) to first clinical response. Clinical response was defined as a Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved). Secondary efficacy outcomes included the proportion of responders at each study visit and the change from baseline in ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS-IV) and CGI-Severity scores. Tolerability and safety were assessed by monitoring treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), height and weight, vital signs and electrocardiogram parameters. Endpoint was defined as the last post-baseline, on-treatment visit with a valid assessment.
RESULTS: Of 267 patients randomized (LDX, n = 133; ATX, n = 134), 200 (74.9%) completed the study. The median time to first clinical response [95% confidence interval (CI)] was significantly shorter for patients receiving LDX [12.0 days (8.0-16.0)] than for those receiving ATX [21.0 days (15.0-23.0)] (p = 0.001). By week 9, 81.7% (95% CI 75.0-88.5) of patients receiving LDX had responded to treatment compared with 63.6% (95% CI 55.4-71.8) of those receiving ATX (p = 0.001). Also by week 9, the difference between LDX and ATX in least-squares mean change from baseline (95% CI) was significant in favour of LDX for the ADHD-RS-IV total score [-6.5 (-9.3 to -3.6); p < 0.001; effect size 0.56], inattentiveness subscale score [-3.4 (-4.9 to -1.8); p < 0.001; effect size 0.53] and the hyperactivity/impulsivity subscale score [-3.2 (-4.6 to -1.7); p < 0.001; effect size 0.53]. TEAEs were reported by 71.9 and 70.9% of patients receiving LDX and ATX, respectively. At endpoint, both treatments were associated with mean (standard deviation) increases in systolic blood pressure [LDX, +0.7 mmHg (9.08); ATX, +0.6 mmHg (7.96)], diastolic blood pressure [LDX, +0.1 mmHg (8.33); ATX, +1.3 mmHg (8.24)] and pulse rate [LDX, +3.6 bpm (10.49); ATX, +3.7 bpm (10.75)], and decreases in weight [LDX, -1.30 kg (1.806); ATX, -0.15 kg (1.434)].

METHODS: We reviewed the results of 181 liver transplants performed in our institution between January 1, 1998 and December 31, 2000 in which the recipients were alive with good liver function at the end of the follow-up period (mean 2.7 years). Renal dysfunction was defined as a serum creatinine (Cr) greater than or equal to 2 mg/dL in both acute and chronic settings.
RESULTS: The incidence of ARD during the first posttransplant week was 39.2% (n=71), whereas late CRD occurred in 6.0% (n=11) of the patients by the end of the follow-up period. Among the variables we examined for association with CRD, five factors were found to be statistically significant in univariate analysis: pretransplant diabetes (PRTDM) (0.000), Cr greater than or equal to 2 during the first postoperative week (0.003), posttransplant diabetes (POTDM) (0.014), age greater than 50 (0.025), and tacrolimus level greater than 15 ng/mL at postoperative day 15 (0.058). In binary logistic regression analysis, PRTDM (odds ratio [OR]=5.7, 95% confidence interval [CI]) and early postoperative ARD (OR=10.2 95% CI) remained consistently significant. Nine of 11 patients with CRD also had a history of ARD during the first postoperative week. These patients progressed to CRD despite the fact that seven of nine had normalized their renal function by day 90 posttransplant.
CONCLUSION: We suggest that a combination of events during the first postoperative week after liver transplant serve as a physiologic ""stress test"" for the kidneys. Patients who fail the test (peak Cr >/=2 mg/dL during the first postoperative week) as well as the patients with diabetes mellitus are at increased risk of CRD.

Preclinical and clinical research suggest that hypofractionation-fewer treatments but at a higher dose per treatment-may produce similar outcomes. This trial was designed to assess whether the efficacy of a hypofractionated radiotherapy (H-RT) treatment schedule is no worse than a C-RT schedule in men with low-risk prostate cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 1,115 men with low-risk prostate cancer were randomly assigned 1:1 to C-RT (73.8 Gy in 41 fractions over 8.2 weeks) or to H-RT (70 Gy in 28 fractions over 5.6 weeks). This trial was designed to establish (with 90% power and an α of .05) that treatment with H-RT results in 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) that is not worse than C-RT by more than 7.65% (H-RT/C-RT hazard ratio [HR] < 1.52).
RESULTS: A total of 1,092 men were protocol eligible and had follow-up information; 542 patients were assigned to C-RT and 550 to H-RT. Median follow-up was 5.8 years. Baseline characteristics were not different according to treatment assignment. The estimated 5-year DFS was 85.3% (95% CI, 81.9 to 88.1) in the C-RT arm and 86.3% (95% CI, 83.1 to 89.0) in the H-RT arm. The DFS HR was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.64 to 1.14), and the predefined noninferiority criterion that required that DFS outcomes be consistent with HR < 1.52 was met (P < .001). Late grade 2 and 3 GI and genitourinary adverse events were increased (HR, 1.31 to 1.59) in patients who were treated with H-RT.
CONCLUSION: In men with low-risk prostate cancer, the efficacy of 70 Gy in 28 fractions over 5.6 weeks is not inferior to 73.8 Gy in 41 fractions over 8.2 weeks, although an increase in late GI/genitourinary adverse events was observed in patients treated with H-RT.",1,PRIMARY,Five-year Disease-free Survival (DFS) Rate,"Five-year rates are estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method.

METHODS: This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter phase III trial comprised: 4-week retrospective and 4-week prospective baseline, 12-week dose-adjustment, and 16-week evaluation periods. Chinese and Japanese patients ≥16 years old with idiopathic generalized, symptomatic generalized, or undetermined epilepsy with GTC seizures received a single-blind placebo during the prospective baseline, and then were randomized 1:1 to placebo or LEV 1,000 mg/day administered twice daily. Patients reporting GTC seizures up to week 8 had the LEV dosage increased to 3,000 mg/day. The primary efficacy variable was percent reduction from combined baseline in GTC seizures/week during the 28-week treatment period.
RESULTS: Overall, 251 patients were randomized (208 from China; 43 from Japan); 141 (56.2%) completed the 28-week treatment period. Least-squares mean percent reduction from combined baseline in GTC seizures/week (treatment period) was placebo 12.6% versus LEV 68.8% (95% confidence interval, 44.0-68.2; p < 0.0001).

The current study was designed to test the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of intranasal ketamine in patients with depression who had failed at least one prior antidepressant trial.
METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study, 20 patients with major depression were randomly assigned, and 18 completed 2 treatment days with intranasal ketamine hydrochloride (50 mg) or saline solution. The primary efficacy outcome measure was change in depression severity 24 hours after ketamine or placebo, measured using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale. Secondary outcomes included persistence of benefit, changes in self-reports of depression, changes in anxiety, and proportion of responders.

Baseline and 12-week follow-up,10213025,Biomechanics of human quadriceps muscles during electrical stimulation.,"The quadriceps muscles of neurologically intact and spinal cord injured (SCI) human subjects were stimulated with constant current pulses. Up to three, separately adjustable stimulating electrodes over the motor points for vastus medialis (VM), vastus lateralis (VL) and rectus femoris (RF) muscles were used to maximize torque generation while minimizing discomfort. The torque generated by stimulation increased as the knee was slowly flexed to about 1 rad (50-60 degrees) and decreased beyond that point (a 'negative slope' on a torque-angle curve). Despite this region of negative slope the force generated by small oscillations remained positively correlated to the angle changes. When the knee was slowly extended again from a flexed position, the torque continued to decline and therefore showed a large degree of 'hysteresis'. Of the three heads studied, only stimulation of RF muscle generally produced this behavior. VL and VM had torques that increased monotonically with knee flexion over the range studied. The torques generated with electrical stimulation of normal subjects represented up to about 30% of maximum voluntary contraction. When subjects generated similar torques voluntarily, the negative slope region and substantial hysteresis were not observed.

In conjunction with advice from internal and external reviewers and expert consultants in the field, this update is based on a systematic review of the literature centred on the following: the Population (P), Intervention (I), Comparator (C) and Outcomes (O) framework; the use of the SIGN guideline/Cochrane review system; and the 21 point scoring system advocated by IWGDF/EWMA. This has resulted in 13 recommendations. The recommendation on sharp debridement and the selection of dressings remain unchanged from the last recommendations published in 2016. The recommendation to consider negative pressure wound therapy in post-surgical wounds and the judicious use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in certain non-healing ischaemic ulcers also remains unchanged. Recommendations against the use of growth factors, autologous platelet gels, bioengineered skin products, ozone, topical carbon dioxide, nitric oxide or interventions reporting improvement of ulcer healing through an alteration of the physical environment or through other systemic medical or nutritional means also remain. New recommendations include consideration of the use of sucrose-octasulfate impregnated dressings in difficult to heal neuro-ischaemic ulcers and consideration of the use of autologous combined leucocyte, platelet and fibrin patch in ulcers that are difficult to heal, in both cases when used in addition to best standard of care.

We report a post hoc subgroup analysis of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) enrolled in KEYNOTE-181 in Asia, including patients from the KEYNOTE-181 China extension study.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred and forty Asian patients with advanced/metastatic ESCC were enrolled in KEYNOTE-181, including the China cohort. Patients were randomly assigned 1 : 1 to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks for ≤2 years or investigator's choice of paclitaxel, docetaxel, or irinotecan. OS, progression-free survival, response, and safety were analyzed without formal comparisons. OS was evaluated based on PD-L1 CPS expression level.
RESULTS: In Asian patients with ESCC, median OS was 10.0 months with pembrolizumab and 6.5 months with chemotherapy [hazard ratio (HR), 0.63; 95% CI 0.50-0.80; nominal P < 0.0001]. Median progression-free survival was 2.3 months with pembrolizumab and 3.1 months with chemotherapy (HR, 0.79; 95% CI 0.63-0.99; nominal P = 0.020). Objective response rate was 17.1% with pembrolizumab and 7.1% with chemotherapy; median duration of response was 10.5 months and 7.7 months, respectively. In patients with PD-L1 CPS <1 tumors (pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy), the HR was 0.99 (95% CI 0.56-1.72); the HR (95% CI) for death was better for patients with PD-L1 CPS cut-offs >1 [CPS ≥1, 0.57 (0.44-0.75); CPS ≥5, 0.56 (0.41-0.76); CPS ≥10, 0.53 (0.37-0.75)].

OBJECTIVE: The effects of ODN were evaluated on bone mineral density (BMD), biochemical markers of bone turnover, and safety in patients previously treated with alendronate.
DESIGN: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 24-month study.
SETTING: The study was conducted at private or institutional practices.
PARTICIPANTS: Postmenopausal women (n = 243) ≥ 60 years of age with low BMD at the total hip, femoral neck, or trochanter (T-score ≤-2.5 but >-3.5 without prior fracture or ≤-1.5 but >-3.5 with prior fracture) on alendronate for ≥ 3 years.
INTERVENTION: The intervention included ODN 50 mg or placebo weekly.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary end point was percentage change from baseline of femoral neck BMD at month 24. BMD was assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at baseline and 6, 12, and 24 months. Biochemical markers of bone turnover (serum C-telopeptides of type 1 collagen, urinary N-telopeptides of type 1 collagen, serum bone specific alkaline phosphatase, and serum N-terminal propeptide of type 1 collagen) were measured at baseline and 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.
RESULTS: In the ODN group, BMD changes from baseline at the femoral neck, trochanter, total hip, and lumbar spine at 24 months (1.7%, 1.8%, 0.8%, and 2.3%, respectively) were significantly different from the placebo group. ODN significantly decreased urinary N-telopeptides of type 1 collagen to creatinine ratio and significantly increased serum N-terminal propeptide of type 1 collagen compared with placebo. Serum C-telopeptides of type 1 collagen was unexpectedly increased with ODN treatment. The safety profile appeared similar between groups.

METHODS: COVID-PACT (Prevention of Arteriovenous Thrombotic Events in Critically-ill COVID-19 Patients Trial) was a multicenter, 2×2 factorial, open-label, randomized-controlled trial with blinded end point adjudication in intensive care unit-level patients with COVID-19. Patients were randomly assigned to a strategy of full-dose anticoagulation or standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation. Absent an indication for antiplatelet therapy, patients were additionally randomly assigned to either clopidogrel or no antiplatelet therapy. The primary efficacy outcome was the hierarchical composite of death attributable to venous or arterial thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, clinically evident deep venous thrombosis, type 1 myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, systemic embolic event or acute limb ischemia, or clinically silent deep venous thrombosis, through hospital discharge or 28 days. The primary efficacy analyses included an unmatched win ratio and time-to-first event analysis while patients were on treatment. The primary safety outcome was fatal or life-threatening bleeding. The secondary safety outcome was moderate to severe bleeding. Recruitment was stopped early in March 2022 (≈50% planned recruitment) because of waning intensive care unit-level COVID-19 rates.
RESULTS: At 34 centers in the United States, 390 patients were randomly assigned between anticoagulation strategies and 292 between antiplatelet strategies (382 and 290 in the on-treatment analyses). At randomization, 99% of patients required advanced respiratory therapy, including 15% requiring invasive mechanical ventilation; 40% required invasive ventilation during hospitalization. Comparing anticoagulation strategies, a greater proportion of wins occurred with full-dose anticoagulation (12.3%) versus standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation (6.4%; win ratio, 1.95 [95% CI, 1.08-3.55]; 
CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill patients with COVID-19, full-dose anticoagulation, but not clopidogrel, reduced thrombotic complications with an increase in bleeding, driven primarily by transfusions in hemodynamically stable patients, and no apparent excess in mortality.

Common antihypertensive medication classes of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been associated with lower PTSD symptoms. Here we examine the rs4311 SNP in the ACE gene, previously implicated in panic attacks, in the relationship between ACE-I/ARB medications and PTSD symptoms. Participants were recruited from outpatient wait rooms between 2006 and March 2014 (n=  803). We examined the interaction between rs4311 genotype and the presence of blood pressure medication on PTSD symptoms and diagnosis. PTSD symptoms were lower in individuals taking ACE-Is or ARBs (N = 776). The rs4311 was associated with PTSD symptoms and diagnosis (N = 3803), as the T-carriers at the rs4311 SNP had significantly greater likelihood of a PTSD diagnosis. Lastly, the rs4311 genotype modified the effect of ACE-Is or ARBs on PTSD symptoms (N = 443; F1,443 = 4.41, P < 0.05). Individuals with the CC rs4311 genotype showed lower PTSD symptoms in the presence of ACE-Is or ARBs. In contrast, T- carriers showed the opposite, such that the presence of ACE-Is or ARBs was associated with higher PTSD symptoms. These data suggest that the renin-angiotensin system may be important in PTSD, as ACE-I/ARB usage associates with lower symptoms. Furthermore, we provide genetic evidence that some individuals are comparatively more benefitted by ACE-Is/ARBs in PTSD treatment.

Previous stimulant challenge studies using volunteers treated with dopaminergic antagonists have generally failed to demonstrate reduction of subjective effects. We performed this study to determine whether repeated dosing with risperidone reduced the subjective effects of experimentally administered cocaine. Nine non-treatment seeking hospitalized cocaine-dependent volunteers received 40 mg cocaine IV before and following 5 days of treatment with risperidone, 2 mg per day. Risperidone pre-treatment reduced the self-rated 'high' produced by cocaine. Repeated, rather than single, dosing with a D2 antagonist may be necessary to reduce the subjective effects produced by cocaine. The degree of D2 receptor blockade produced by risperidone appears to be greater than the reduction in euphoric effects produced by cocaine, suggesting that mechanisms other than those involving D2 receptors may be important in drug-induced euphoria.",2,PRIMARY,Change Over Time in Frequency of Heavy Drinking Days (Used to Evaluate Treatment Efficacy),Frequency of heavy drinking days is obtained each week retrospectively as the number of heavy drinking days during the prior week (assessed by the Timeline Followback Scale).

We developed a patient-family agenda setting intervention to engage family in cancer care communication.
METHODS: We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial (NCT03283553) of patients on active treatment for breast cancer and their family ""care partner."" Intervention dyads (n = 69) completed a self-administered checklist to clarify care partner roles, establish a shared visit agenda, and facilitate MyChart patient portal access. Control dyads (n = 63) received usual care. We assessed intervention acceptability and initial effects from post-visit surveys and MyChart utilization at 6 weeks.
RESULTS: At baseline, most patients (89.4%) but few care partners (1.5%) were registered for MyChart. Most patients (79.4%) wanted their care partner to have access to their records and 39.4% of care partners reported accessing MyChart. In completing the checklist, patients and care partners endorsed active communication roles for the care partner and identified a similar visit agenda: most (> 90%) reported the checklist was easy, useful, and recommended it to others. At 6 weeks, intervention (vs control) care partners were more likely to be registered for MyChart (75.4% vs 1.6%; p < 0.001), to have logged in (43.5% vs 0%; p < 0.001) and viewed clinical notes (30.4% vs 0%; p < 0.001), but were no more likely to exchange direct messages with clinicians (1.5% vs 0%; p = 0.175).

A safe, effective oral therapy is needed.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether eliglustat, a novel oral substrate reduction therapy, safely reverses clinical manifestations in untreated adults with Gaucher disease type 1.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 18 sites in 12 countries from November 2009 to July 2012 among eligible patients with splenomegaly plus thrombocytopenia and/or anemia. Of 72 patients screened, 40 were enrolled.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were stratified by spleen volume and randomized 1:1 to receive eliglustat (50 or 100 mg twice daily; n = 20) or placebo (n = 20) for 9 months.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary efficacy end point was percentage change in spleen volume in multiples of normal from baseline to 9 months; secondary efficacy end points were change in hemoglobin level and percentage changes in liver volume and platelet count.
RESULTS: All patients had baseline splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia (mostly moderate or severe), most had mild or moderate hepatomegaly, and 20% had mild anemia. Least-square mean spleen volume decreased by 27.77% (95% CI, -32.57% to -22.97%) in the eliglustat group (from 13.89 to 10.17 multiples of normal) vs an increase of 2.26% (95% CI, -2.54% to 7.06%) in the placebo group (from 12.50 to 12.84 multiples of normal) for an absolute treatment difference of -30.03% (95% CI, -36.82% to -23.24%; P < .001). For the secondary end points, the least-square mean absolute differences between groups all favored eliglustat, with a 1.22-g/dL increase in hemoglobin level (95% CI, 0.57-1.88 g/dL; P < .001), 6.64% decrease in liver volume (95% CI, -11.37% to -1.91%; P = .007), and 41.06% increase in platelet count (95% CI, 23.95%-58.17%; P < .001). No serious adverse events occurred. One patient in the eliglustat group withdrew (non-treatment related); 39 of the 40 patients transitioned to an open-label extension study.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among previously untreated adults with Gaucher disease type 1, treatment with eliglustat compared with placebo for 9 months resulted in significant improvements in spleen volume, hemoglobin level, liver volume, and platelet count. The clinical significance of these findings is uncertain, and more definitive conclusions about clinical efficacy and utility will require comparison with the standard treatment of enzyme replacement therapy as well as longer-term follow-up.

A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study has shown the efficacy of alverine citrate/simeticone (ACS) combination for IBS symptom relief.
AIM: As IBS symptoms are often intermittent, this pragmatic study was designed to compare the efficacy of an on-demand ACS treatment vs. that of usual treatments.
METHODS: Rome III IBS patients were enrolled by 87 general practitioners who were randomly allocated to one of two therapeutic strategies: on-demand ACS or usual treatment chosen by the physician. The primary outcome measure was the improvement of the IBSQoL score between inclusion and month 6.
RESULTS: A total of 436 patients (mean age: 54.4 years; women: 73.4%) were included, 222 in the ACS arm and 214 patients in the usual treatment arm, which was mainly antispasmodics. At 6 months, improvement of IBSQoL was greater with ACS than with the usual treatment group (13.8 vs. 8.4; p < 0.0008). The IBS-severity symptom score (IBS-SSS) was lower with ACS than in the usual treatment arm with a mean (SE) decrease of 170.0 (6.6) vs. 110.7 (6.7), respectively (p = 0.0001). An IBS-SSS < 75 was more frequent in the ACS group (37.7% vs. 16.0%; p < 0.0001). Improvement of both abdominal pain and bloating severity was also greater with the on-demand ACS treatment, which was associated with both lower direct and indirect costs.
CONCLUSIONS: After 6 months, on-demand ACS treatment led to a greater improvement of QoL, reduced the burden of the disease and was more effective for IBS symptom relief than usual treatments.",1,PRIMARY,Change From Baseline in Irritable Bowel Syndrome Quality Of Life Overall Score,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Quality of Life total score (IBSQoL) is a health-related Quality of Life (QoL) disease-specific scale adapted for French patients.

METHODS: This study included patients (≥ 40 years of age) with a clinical and radiographic diagnosis of knee OA. Patients were randomized to etoricoxib 30 mg (qd) or celecoxib 200 mg (qd) in a 12 week randomized, controlled, double-blind study. Prior NSAID users were to demonstrate a worsening of symptoms upon withdrawal of medication. Efficacy endpoints included the time-weighted average change from baseline in the WOMAC VA 3.0 Pain Subscale (100 mm Visual Analog Scale [VAS]; primary endpoint), the WOMAC VA 3.0 Physical Function Subscale (100 mm VAS), and Patient Global Assessment of Disease Status (PGAD) (100 mm VAS). The primary hypothesis was that etoricoxib 30 mg is non-inferior to celecoxib 200 mg as assessed by the primary endpoint (the non-inferiority margin was set at 10 mm VAS). Adverse events (AEs), laboratory parameters, and vital signs were monitored.
RESULTS: There were 239 patients (89.5% female; mean age: 63.3 years) randomized to etoricoxib 30 mg (n = 120) and celecoxib 200 mg (n = 119). The differences (etoricoxib vs celecoxib) in least square (LS) mean change (95% CI) for WOMAC Pain, WOMAC Physical Function, and PGAD were -1.63 mm (-5.37, 2.10), -1.32 mm (-4.88, 2.23), and -1.09 mm (-5.48, 3.30), respectively. Drug-related clinical AEs occurred in 6.7% (etoricoxib) and 2.5% (celecoxib) of patients. This study was limited because it was not designed or powered to adequately capture and evaluate rare AEs associated with NSAID treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Etoricoxib 30 mg administered once daily in Korean patients with knee OA demonstrated non-inferior clinical efficacy to celecoxib 200 mg over 12 weeks of treatment as assessed by all primary and secondary outcomes. Etoricoxib 30 mg qd and celecoxib 200 mg qd were generally safe and well tolerated.

Pharmacological treatment options, including antipsychotics are not satisfactory.
OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of citalopram for agitation in patients with Alzheimer disease. Key secondary objectives examined effects of citalopram on function, caregiver distress, safety, cognitive safety, and tolerability.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Citalopram for Agitation in Alzheimer Disease Study (CitAD) was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group trial that enrolled 186 patients with probable Alzheimer disease and clinically significant agitation from 8 academic centers in the United States and Canada from August 2009 to January 2013.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants (n = 186) were randomized to receive a psychosocial intervention plus either citalopram (n = 94) or placebo (n = 92) for 9 weeks. Dosage began at 10 mg per day with planned titration to 30 mg per day over 3 weeks based on response and tolerability.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome measures were based on scores from the 18-point Neurobehavioral Rating Scale agitation subscale (NBRS-A) and the modified Alzheimer Disease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change (mADCS-CGIC). Other outcomes were based on scores from the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), ability to complete activities of daily living (ADLs), caregiver distress, cognitive safety (based on scores from the 30-point Mini Mental State Examination [MMSE]), and adverse events.
RESULTS: Participants who received citalopram showed significant improvement compared with those who received placebo on both primary outcome measures. The NBRS-A estimated treatment difference at week 9 (citalopram minus placebo) was -0.93 (95% CI, -1.80 to -0.06), P = .04. Results from the mADCS-CGIC showed 40% of citalopram participants having moderate or marked improvement from baseline compared with 26% of placebo recipients, with estimated treatment effect (odds ratio [OR] of being at or better than a given CGIC category) of 2.13 (95% CI, 1.23-3.69), P = .01. Participants who received citalopram showed significant improvement on the CMAI, total NPI, and caregiver distress scores but not on the NPI agitation subscale, ADLs, or in less use of rescue lorazepam. Worsening of cognition (-1.05 points; 95% CI, -1.97 to -0.13; P = .03) and QT interval prolongation (18.1 ms; 95% CI, 6.1-30.1; P = .01) were seen in the citalopram group.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with probable Alzheimer disease and agitation who were receiving psychosocial intervention, the addition of citalopram compared with placebo significantly reduced agitation and caregiver distress; however, cognitive and cardiac adverse effects of citalopram may limit its practical application at the dosage of 30 mg per day.

DESIGN: Participants were randomized to receive 12 weeks of aripiprazole or placebo, with a 3-month follow-up and a platform of weekly 30-minute substance abuse counseling.
SETTING: The trial was conducted from January 2009 to March 2012 at the San Francisco Department of Public Health.
PARTICIPANTS: Ninety actively using, methamphetamine-dependent, sexually active adults were recruited from community venues.
MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was regression estimated reductions in weekly methamphetamine-positive urines. Secondary outcomes were study medication adherence [by self-report and medication event monitoring systems (MEMS)], sexual risk behavior and abstinence from methamphetamine.
FINDINGS: Participant mean age was 38.7 years, 87.8% were male, 50.0% white, 18.9% African American, and 16.7% Latino. Eighty-three per cent of follow-up visits and final visits were completed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Survey of 323 patients and 389 care partners at Geisinger Health System with linked information regarding access and use of patient portal functionality.
RESULTS: Few (0.4%) registered adult patient portal users shared access to their account. Patients varied in age (range: 18-102); more than half had a high school education or less (53.6%). Patient motivations for sharing access included: to help manage care (41.9%), for emergency reasons (29.7%), lack of technology experience (18.4%), or care partner request (10.0%). Care partners were parents (39.8%), adult children (27.9%), spouses (26.2%), and other relatives (6.1%). Patients were more likely than care partners to have inadequate health literacy (54.8% versus 8.8%, P < .001) and less confident in their ability to manage their care (53.0% versus 88.1%; P < .001). Care partners were more likely than patients to perform health management activities electronically (95.5% versus 48.4%; P < .001), access the patient portal (89.2% versus 30.3%; P < .001), and use patient portal functionality such as secure messaging (39.6% versus 13.9%; P < .001). Care partners used their own credentials (89.1%) and patient credentials (23.3%) to access the patient portal.

Apabetalone is a selective bromodomain and extraterminal protein inhibitor targeting bromodomain 2 and is hypothesized to have potentially favorable effects on pathways related to atherothrombosis. Pooled phase 2 data suggest favorable effects on clinical outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: To test whether apabetalone significantly reduces major adverse cardiovascular events.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, conducted at 190 sites in 13 countries. Patients with an acute coronary syndrome in the preceding 7 to 90 days, type 2 diabetes, and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were eligible for enrollment, which started November 11, 2015, and ended July 4, 2018, with end of follow-up on July 3, 2019.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive apabetalone, 100 mg orally twice daily (n = 1215), or matching placebo (n = 1210) in addition to standard care.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was a composite of time to the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or stroke.
RESULTS: Among 2425 patients who were randomized (mean age, 62 years; 618 women [25.6%]), 2320 (95.7%) had full ascertainment of the primary outcome. During a median follow-up of 26.5 months, 274 primary end points occurred: 125 (10.3%) in apabetalone-treated patients and 149 (12.4%) in placebo-treated patients (hazard ratio, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.65-1.04]; P = .11). More patients allocated to apabetalone than placebo discontinued study drug (114 [9.4%] vs 69 [5.7%]) for reasons including elevations of liver enzyme levels (35 [2.9%] vs 11 [0.9%]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with recent acute coronary syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, the selective bromodomain and extraterminal protein inhibitor apabetalone added to standard therapy did not significantly reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients on metformin and a sulfonylurea were randomised to exenatide (n = 253; 5 microg twice daily for 4 weeks, 10 microg thereafter) or biphasic insulin aspart (n = 248; twice-daily doses titrated for optimal glucose control), while continuing with metformin and sulfonylurea treatment.
RESULTS: Glycaemic control achieved with exenatide was non-inferior to that achieved with biphasic insulin aspart (mean+/-SEM, HbA(1c) change: exenatide -1.04 +/- 0.07%, biphasic insulin aspart -0.89 +/- 0.06%; difference -0.15 [95% CI -0.32 to 0.01]%). Exenatide-treated patients lost weight, while patients treated with biphasic insulin aspart gained weight [between-group difference -5.4 (95% CI -5.9 to -5.0) kg]. Both treatments reduced fasting serum glucose (exenatide -1.8 +/- 0.2 mmol/l, p < 0.001; biphasic insulin aspart -1.7 +/- 0.2 mmol/l, p < 0.001). Greater reductions in postprandial glucose excursions following morning (p < 0.001), midday (p = 0.002) and evening meals (p < 0.001) were observed with exenatide. The withdrawal rate was 21.3% (54/253) for exenatide and 10.1% (25/248) for biphasic insulin aspart. Nausea (33% incidence, 3.5% discontinuation) was the most common adverse event observed with exenatide.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Exenatide treatment resulted in HbA(1c) reduction similar to biphasic insulin aspart and provided better postprandial glycaemic control, making it a potential alternative for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Treatment with biphasic insulin aspart was associated with weight gain and lower risk of adverse gastrointestinal events.

METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred and fifty type 2 diabetes patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) or ≥ 1 other CVD risk factor were randomized to receive rosiglitazone vs. placebo for 6 months. The primary outcome was peak oxygen uptake indexed to fat-free mass (VO(2peak)-FFM) during maximum exercise. A subset of 102 subjects underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI). On hundred and eight subjects completed the study, including 75 completing the cMRI substudy. No significant differences were observed in mean VO(2peak)-FFM between rosiglitazone and placebo (26.1 ± 7.0 vs. 27.6 ± 6.6 mL/kg-FFM/min; P = 0.26). Compared with placebo, the rosiglitazone group had lower hematocrit (38 vs. 41%; P < 0.001) and more peripheral oedema (53.7 vs. 33.3%; P = 0.03). In the cMRI substudy, compared with placebo, the rosiglitazone group had larger end-diastolic volume (128.1 vs. 112.0 mL; P = 0.01) and stroke volume (83.7 vs. 72.9 mL; P = 0.01), and a trend toward increased peak ventricular filling rate (79.4 vs. 60.5; P = 0.07).
CONCLUSION: Rosiglitazone increased peripheral oedema but had no pernicious effects on cardiovascular performance or cardiac function, with modest improvement in selected cMRI measures. Changes in indirect markers of plasma volume suggest expansion with rosiglitazone.

Omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids may slow down the decline of kidney function. The effect of marine and plant-derived n-3 fatty acids on kidney function in patients after myocardial infarction was examined.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: In the Alpha Omega Trial, 2344 patients with history of myocardial infarction ages 60-80 years old (81% men) were randomized to one of four trial margarines. The patients received an additional targeted amount of 400 mg/d eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, 2 g/d α-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid-docosahexaenoic acid plus α-linolenic acid, or placebo for 40 months. Serum cystatin C and serum creatinine were assessed at baseline and after 40 months. Creatinine-cystatin C-based GFR was estimated with the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation.

Among treatment-naïve patients, SVR12 rates were 97% (67/69) and 82% (28/34), respectively, in OBV/PTV/r+DSV+RBV and TPV+PegIFN/RBV-treated GT1a-infected patients; SVR12 rates were 99% (83/84), 98% (81/83), and 78% (32/41) in OBV/PTV/r+DSV+RBV, OBV/PTV/r+DSV, and TPV+PegIFN/RBV-treated GT1b-infected patients. Among treatment-experienced patients, SVR12 rates were 99% (100/101) and 66% (31/47) with OBV/PTV/r+DSV+RBV and TPV+PegIFN/RBV. Mental and physical health were generally better with OBV/PTV/r+DSV±RBV than TPV+PegIFN/RBV. Rates of discontinuation due to adverse events (0-1% and 8-11%, respectively, p<0.05) and rates of hemoglobin decline to <10g/dl (0-4% and 34-47%, respectively, p<0.05) were lower for OBV/PTV/r+DSV±RBV than TPV+PegIFN/RBV.

An injection of autologous blood might provide the necessary cellular and humoral mediators to induce a healing cascade. The purpose of this study was to evaluate prospectively the results of refractory lateral epicondylitis treated with autologous blood injections.
METHOD: Twenty-eight patients with lateral epicondylitis were injected with 2 mL of autologous blood under the extensor carpi radialis brevis. All patients had failed previous nonsurgical treatments including all or combinations of physical therapy, splinting, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication, and prior steroid injections. Patients kept personal logs and rated their pain (0-10) and categorized themselves according to Nirschl staging (0-7) daily.
RESULTS: The average follow-up period was 9.5 months (range, 6-24 mo). After autologous blood injections the average pain score decreased from 7.8 to 2.3. The average Nirschl stage decreased from 6.5 to 2.0. For the 9 patients receiving more than one blood injection the mean pain score and Nirschl stage before injection were 7.2 and 6.6, respectively. After the second blood injection the pain and Nirschl scores were both 0.9. Two patients received a third blood injection that brought both pain and Nirschl scores to 0.
CONCLUSIONS: After autologous blood injection therapy 22 patients (79%) in whom nonsurgical modalities had failed were relieved completely of pain even during strenuous activity. This study offers encouraging results of an alternative minimally invasive treatment that addresses the pathophysiology of lateral epicondylitis that has failed traditional nonsurgical modalities.",1,PRIMARY,Pain (at 1 Week): Visual Analogue Scale(0 to 10),"VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE:

We aimed to determine whether this strategy is a safe and effective treatment for improving arm function after stroke.
METHODS: In this pivotal, randomised, triple-blind, sham-controlled trial, done in 19 stroke rehabilitation services in the UK and the USA, participants with moderate-to-severe arm weakness, at least 9 months after ischaemic stroke, were randomly assigned (1:1) to either rehabilitation paired with active vagus nerve stimulation (VNS group) or rehabilitation paired with sham stimulation (control group). Randomisation was done by ResearchPoint Global (Austin, TX, USA) using SAS PROC PLAN (SAS Institute Software, Cary, NC, USA), with stratification by region (USA vs UK), age (≤30 years vs >30 years), and baseline Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) score (20-35 vs 36-50). Participants, outcomes assessors, and treating therapists were masked to group assignment. All participants were implanted with a vagus nerve stimulation device. The VNS group received 0·8 mA, 100 μs, 30 Hz stimulation pulses, lasting 0·5 s. The control group received 0 mA pulses. Participants received 6 weeks of in-clinic therapy (three times per week; total of 18 sessions) followed by a home exercise programme. The primary outcome was the change in impairment measured by the FMA-UE score on the first day after completion of in-clinic therapy. FMA-UE response rates were also assessed at 90 days after in-clinic therapy (secondary endpoint). All analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03131960.
FINDINGS: Between Oct 2, 2017, and Sept 12, 2019, 108 participants were randomly assigned to treatment (53 to the VNS group and 55 to the control group). 106 completed the study (one patient for each group did not complete the study). On the first day after completion of in-clinic therapy, the mean FMA-UE score increased by 5·0 points (SD 4·4) in the VNS group and by 2·4 points (3·8) in the control group (between group difference 2·6, 95% CI 1·0-4·2, p=0·0014). 90 days after in-clinic therapy, a clinically meaningful response on the FMA-UE score was achieved in 23 (47%) of 53 patients in the VNS group versus 13 (24%) of 55 patients in the control group (between group difference 24%, 6-41; p=0·0098).

BACKGROUND: From a patient's perspective, access site management after percutaneous procedures remains challenging.
METHODS: Patients enrolled in this multicenter, nonblinded trial underwent 6-F diagnostic or interventional procedures were randomly assigned 2:1 to VCD versus MC. The primary efficacy end points were time to hemostasis (TTH) and time to ambulation (TTA), and the primary safety end points were periprocedural and 30-day incidence of arterial access-related complications.
RESULTS: The trial assigned 401 patients (mean age 62.7 +/- 10.9 years, 66.1% men) to VCD (n = 267) versus MC (n = 134) after 87 ""roll-in"" patients treated at 17 participating institutions. The baseline characteristics of the groups were similar. Procedural success was 91.8% in the VCD versus 91.0% in the MC group (p = NS). Mean TTH was 4.4 +/- 11.6 min in the VCD versus 20.1 +/- 22.5 min in the MC group (95% confidence interval: 19.0 to 12.3; p < 0.0001).

OBJECTIVE: To test cognitive behavioral therapy for ADHD in adults treated with medication but who still have clinically significant symptoms.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Randomized controlled trial assessing the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy for 86 symptomatic adults with ADHD who were already being treated with medication. The study was conducted at a US hospital between November 2004 and June 2008 (follow-up was conducted through July 2009). Of the 86 patients randomized, 79 completed treatment and 70 completed the follow-up assessments.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to 12 individual sessions of either cognitive behavioral therapy or relaxation with educational support (which is an attention-matched comparison).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary measures were ADHD symptoms rated by an assessor (ADHD rating scale and Clinical Global Impression scale) at baseline, posttreatment, and at 6- and 12-month follow-up. The assessor was blinded to treatment condition assignment. The secondary outcome measure was self-report of ADHD symptoms.
RESULTS: Cognitive behavioral therapy achieved lower posttreatment scores on both the Clinical Global Impression scale (magnitude -0.0531; 95% confidence interval [CI], -1.01 to -0.05; P = .03) and the ADHD rating scale (magnitude -4.631; 95% CI, -8.30 to -0.963; P = .02) compared with relaxation with educational support. Throughout treatment, self-reported symptoms were also significantly more improved for cognitive behavioral therapy (beta = -0.41; 95% CI, -0.64 to -0.17; P <001), and there were more treatment responders in cognitive behavioral therapy for both the Clinical Global Impression scale (53% vs 23%; odds ratio [OR], 3.80; 95% CI, 1.50 to 9.59; P = .01) and the ADHD rating scale (67% vs 33%; OR, 4.29; 95% CI, 1.74 to 10.58; P = .002).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were classified as low-risk (≤T3, ≤N2B, ≤10 pack-year history) or high-risk (T4 or ≥N2C or >10 PYH). After three cycles of carboplatin/nab-paclitaxel, response was assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1. Low-risk patients with ≥50% response received 50 Gray (Gy) RT (RT50) while low-risk patients with 30%-50% response or high-risk patients with ≥50% response received 45 Gy CRT (CRT45). Patients with lesser response received standard-of-care 75 Gy CRT (CRT75). RT/CRT was limited to the first echelon of uninvolved nodes. The primary end point was 2-year progression-free survival compared with a historic control of 85%. Secondary end points included overall survival and toxicity.
RESULTS: Sixty-two patients (28 low risk/34 high risk) were enrolled. Of low-risk patients, 71% received RT50 while 21% received CRT45. Of high-risk patients, 71% received CRT45. With a median follow-up of 29 months, 2-year PFS and OS were 95% and 100% for low-risk patients and 94% and 97% for high-risk patients, respectively. The overall 2-year PFS was 94.5% and within the 11% noninferiority margin for the historic control.

We sought to confirm the beneficial effect of pirfenidone on disease progression in such patients.
METHODS: In this phase 3 study, we randomly assigned 555 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis to receive either oral pirfenidone (2403 mg per day) or placebo for 52 weeks. The primary end point was the change in FVC or death at week 52. Secondary end points were the 6-minute walk distance, progression-free survival, dyspnea, and death from any cause or from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
RESULTS: In the pirfenidone group, as compared with the placebo group, there was a relative reduction of 47.9% in the proportion of patients who had an absolute decline of 10 percentage points or more in the percentage of the predicted FVC or who died; there was also a relative increase of 132.5% in the proportion of patients with no decline in FVC (P<0.001). Pirfenidone reduced the decline in the 6-minute walk distance (P=0.04) and improved progression-free survival (P<0.001). There was no significant between-group difference in dyspnea scores (P=0.16) or in rates of death from any cause (P=0.10) or from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (P=0.23). However, in a prespecified pooled analysis incorporating results from two previous phase 3 trials, the between-group difference favoring pirfenidone was significant for death from any cause (P=0.01) and from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (P=0.006). Gastrointestinal and skin-related adverse events were more common in the pirfenidone group than in the placebo group but rarely led to treatment discontinuation.
CONCLUSIONS: Pirfenidone, as compared with placebo, reduced disease progression, as reflected by lung function, exercise tolerance, and progression-free survival, in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

Trials of sublingual formulations in North America are needed to confirm European efficacy and safety data.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the efficacy and safety of timothy grass allergy immunotherapy tablet (AIT) treatment in North American subjects with ARC.
METHODS: Four hundred thirty-nine adults with grass pollen-induced ARC with or without asthma were randomized to once-daily 2,800 bioequivalent allergen units of standardized grass AIT (oral lyophilisate, Phleum pratense, 75,000 standardized quality tablet, containing approximately 15 μg of Phl p 5) or placebo approximately 16 weeks before the 2009 grass pollen season (GPS). The primary end point was the average total combined score of the daily symptom score and the daily medication score during the GPS. Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire with standardized activities (RQLQ[S]) scores, Phl p 5-specific IgG4 levels, and IgE-blocking factor levels were additional end points. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored for safety.
RESULTS: Relative to placebo, grass AIT treatment improved total combined scores by 20% (P = .005), daily symptom scores by 18% (P = .02), and RQLQ(S) scores by 17% (P = .02). Daily medication scores were improved by 26% and trended toward significance (P = .08). Phl p 5-specific IgG4 and IgE-blocking factor levels were higher after grass AIT treatment compared with those after placebo at the end of the GPS (P < .001). Grass AIT treatment was safe and well tolerated. The majority of AEs were transient mild local reactions with no investigator-diagnosed grass AIT-related serious AEs or reports of anaphylactic shock/respiratory compromise. In the grass AIT group, 1 subject received epinephrine after experiencing a possible grade 1 systemic reaction (local site reactions, chest discomfort, and rash).

DESIGN: A representative population survey using the 1998 South Australian Health Omnibus Survey.
SAMPLE: Random selection of 4400 households; 3010 interviews were conducted in the respondents' homes by trained female interviewers. This cross sectional survey included men and women aged 15-97 years.
RESULTS: The prevalence of all types of self-reported urinary incontinence in men was 4.4% and in women was 35.3% (P<0.001). Urinary incontinence was more commonly reported in nulliparous women than men and increased after pregnancy according to parity and age. The highest prevalence (51.9%) was reported in women aged 70-74 years. The prevalence of flatus and faecal incontinence was 6.8% and 2.3% in men and 10.9% and 3.5% in women, respectively. Pregnancy (> 20 weeks), regardless of the mode of delivery, greatly increased the prevalence of major pelvic floor dysfunction, defined as any type of incontinence, symptoms of prolapse or previous pelvic floor surgery. Multivariate logistic regression showed that, compared with nulliparity, pelvic floor dysfunction was significantly associated with caesarean section (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.5-4.3), spontaneous vaginal delivery (OR 3.4, 95% CI 2.4-4.9) and at least one instrumental delivery (OR 4.3, 95% CI 2.8-6.6). The difference between caesarean and instrumental delivery was significant (P<0.03) but was not for caesarean and spontaneous delivery. Other associations with pelvic floor morbidity were age, body mass index, coughing, osteoporosis, arthritis and reduced quality of life scores. Symptoms of haemorrhoids also increased with age and parity and were reported in 19.9% of men and 30.2% of women.

It has major impact on patients through disability and associated comorbidities. Current treatment strategies have considerably improved the prognosis, but recent innovations (especially biologic drugs and the new class of so-called ""JAK/STAT inhibitors"") have important safety issues and are very costly. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are highly effective in RA, and could reduce the need for expensive treatment with biologic agents. However, despite more than 65 years of clinical experience, there is a lack of studies large enough to adequately document the benefit/harm balance. The result is inappropriate treatment strategies, i.e. both under-use and over-use of GCs, and consequently suboptimal treatment of RA.
METHODS: The GLORIA study is a pragmatic multicentre, 2-year, randomised, double-blind, clinical trial to assess the safety and effectiveness of a daily dose of 5 mg prednisolone or matching placebo added to standard of care in elderly patients with RA. Eligible participants are diagnosed with RA, have inadequate disease control (disease activity score, DAS28 ≥ 2.6), and are ≥ 65 years. The primary outcome measures are the time-averaged mean value of the DAS28 and the occurrence of serious adverse events or adverse events of special interest. During the trial, change in antirheumatic therapy is permitted as clinically indicated, except for GCs. Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility are secondary outcomes. The main challenge is the interpretation of the trial result with two primary endpoints and the pragmatic trial design that allows co-interventions. Another challenge is the definition of safety and the relative lack of power to detect differences between treatment groups. We have chosen to define safety as the number of patients experiencing at least one serious adverse event. We also specify a decision tree to guide our conclusion on the balance of benefit and harm, and our methodology to combat potential confounding caused by co-interventions.
DISCUSSION: Pragmatic trials minimise impact on daily practice and maximise clinical relevance of the results, but analysis and interpretation of the results is challenging. We expect that the results of this trial are of importance for all rheumatologists who treat elderly patients with RA.

Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4) inhibitors are glucose-lowering medications with pleiotropic actions that may particularly benefit people with HIV, but the immune and virological safety of DPP4 inhibition in HIV is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: DPP4 inhibition will not reduce CD4+ T lymphocyte number or increase HIV viremia in HIV-positive adults.
DESIGN: This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind safety trial of sitagliptin in HIV-positive adults.
SETTING: The study was conducted at an academic medical center.
PARTICIPANTS: Twenty nondiabetic HIV-positive men and women (9.8 ± 5.5 years of known HIV) taking antiretroviral therapy and with stable immune (625 ± 134 CD4+ T cells per microliter) and virological (<48 copies HIV RNA per milliliter) status.
INTERVENTION: The intervention included sitagliptin (100 mg/d) vs matching placebo for up to 24 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: CD4+ T cell number and plasma HIV RNA were measured every 4 weeks; fasting serum regulated upon activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), stromal derived factor (SDF)-1α, Soluble TNF receptor II, and oral glucose tolerance were measured at baseline, week 8, and the end of study. ANOVA was used for between-group comparisons; P < .05 was considered significant.
RESULTS: Compared with placebo, sitagliptin did not reduce CD4+ T cell count, plasma HIV RNA remained less than 48 copies/mL, RANTES and soluble TNF receptor II concentrations did not increase.

This study investigated whether cigarette demand predicted response to contingent monetary rewards for abstinence among individuals with substance use disorders. It also sought to replicate evidence for greater price sensitivity at whole-dollar pack price transitions (ie, left-digit effects).
METHODS: Participants (N = 338) were individuals in residential substance use disorder treatment who participated in a randomized controlled trial that compared contingent vouchers to noncontingent vouchers for smoking abstinence. Baseline demand indices were used to predict number of abstinent days during the 14-day voucher period (after the reduction lead-in) and at 1 and 3 months afterward.
RESULTS: Demand indices correlated with measures of smoking and nicotine dependence. As measured by elasticity, intensity and O max, higher demand significantly predicted fewer abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings during voucher period for individuals in the noncontingent vouchers condition. Breakpoint exhibited a trend-level association with abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings. Demand indices did not predict abstinence in the contingent vouchers group, and did not predict abstinence at 1- and 3-month follow-ups. Left-digit price transitions were associated with significantly greater reductions in consumption.
CONCLUSIONS: The association of cigarette demand with smoking behavior only in the group for whom abstinence was not incentivized indicates that CPT assesses the value of smoking more than the value of money per se and that vouchers counteract the effects of the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes. Results provide initial short-term evidence of predictive validity for the CPT indices.
IMPLICATIONS: This study provides the first evidence of the validity of the CPT for predicting early response to brief advice for smoking cessation plus nicotine replacement in smokers with substance dependence. However, demand for cigarettes did not predict voucher-based treatment response, indicating that incentives serve as a powerful motivator not to smoke that acts in opposition to the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes and that the indices reflect the value of smoking more than the value of money per se.",0,PRIMARY,Number of Participants With Relapse to Any Heavy Drinking,Heavy drinking = 6 or more drinks for men; 5 or more drinks for women,Contingency Management (CM),Noncontingent Reinforcement (NR),"Condition provides contingent monetary reinforcement for smoking reductions (first 5 days) then for smoking abstinence (subsequent 14 days).

Our aim was to compare analgesic efficacy of transmuscular QLB with lumbar plexus block (LPB) for patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty patients receiving transmuscular QLB were propensity score matched with 30 patients receiving LPB for age, sex, ASA score, BMI, operative time, preoperative oxycodone, and intraoperative opioid use. The primary outcome was postoperative opioid consumption during the first 24 postoperative hours. Secondary outcomes included static pain scores at 0-12, 12-24, and 24-48 h intervals, opioid consumption at 0-12, 12-24, and 24-48 h intervals and the length of hospital stay. The incidence of severe adverse events was also compared.
RESULTS: Opioid consumption (median [IQR]) in the first 24 h was similar between the transmuscular QLB and LPB patient groups-33.6 mg (22.9-48.5) versus 32.8 mg (24.8-58.3) intravenous morphine equivalents. There was no difference between groups in static pain scores or opioid consumption during any time interval up to 48 h postoperatively. Length of hospital stay (median [IQR]) was similar between the transmuscular QLB and LPB groups-55.6 h (53.7-60.3) versus 57.9 h (54.3-79.1).
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that transmuscular QLB provides similar analgesia to LPB following THA. Prospective studies are needed to confirm this.",2,PRIMARY,Pain at Rest After Surgery,"Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score (0-10, 0 means no pain, 10 means the worst pain) of pain at rest.

Quadratus lumborum type 3 block: Patient will be placed in a lateral position with the side to be blocked facing up. A low frequency transducer will be used to identify three layers of abdominal musculature, probe will be then moved posteriorly till the transverse abdominus aponeurosis is visualized, the QL muscle is then identified by tracing the aponeurosis posteriorly. The transducer is then moved more posteriorly to visualize the shadow of transverse process and the origin of QL muscle. Psoas muscle is then identified lying anterior to the QL muscle. A 22 gauge 8 cm is inserted in plane posterior to the probe and advanced intramuscularly through the QL to interfacial plane between QL and psoas major and local anesthetic is deposited.

Ropivacaine injection: 0.5% ropivacaine 20 ml (100 mg) will be injected for both groups.","0.5% ropivacaine 100 mg (20 ml) will be injected

Lumbar plexus block: Patient will be positioned in lateral decubitus position with side to be blocked facing upwards. Midline will be identified by palpating the spinous process. Intercristal line will be drawn connecting iliac crests. The point of needle insertion will be 4 cm lateral to the intersection of both lines. The transverse process will first contact with a finder needle. Subsequently an 18 gauge 10 cm insulated needle will be used and advanced until it contacted the transverse process. Needle will then be redirected cephalad or caudad and advanced 2 cm, until the quadriceps femoris twitch is obtained. Local anesthetic will then be injected after confirming a motor response between 0.3-0.5 milli amperes.
