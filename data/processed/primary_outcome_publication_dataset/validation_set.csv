OBJECTIVE: To compare Sativex with placebo in relieving symptoms of spasticity due to MS.
METHODS: A 15-week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in 337 subjects with MS spasticity not fully relieved with current anti-spasticity therapy.
RESULTS: The primary endpoint was a spasticity 0-10 numeric rating scale (NRS). Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis showed a non-significant improvement in NRS score, in favor of Sativex. The per protocol (PP) population (79% of subjects) change in NRS score and responder analyses (> or =30% improvement from baseline) were both significantly superior for Sativex, compared with placebo: -1.3 versus -0.8 points (change from baseline, p=0.035); and 36% versus 24% (responders, p=0.040). These were supported by the time to response (ITT: p=0.068; PP: p=0.025) analyses, carer global impression of change assessment (p=0.013) and timed 10-meter walk (p=0.042). Among the subjects who achieved a > or =30% response in spasticity with Sativex, 98, 94 and 73% reported improvements of 10, 20 and 30%, respectively, at least once during the first 4 weeks of treatment. Sativex was generally well tolerated, with most adverse events reported being mild-to-moderate in severity.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The 0-10 NRS and responder PP analyses demonstrated that Sativex treatment resulted in a significant reduction in treatment-resistant spasticity, in subjects with advanced MS and severe spasticity. The response observed within the first 4 weeks of treatment appears to be a useful aid to prediction of responder/non-responder status.",0,PRIMARY,Change From Baseline in Mean Spasticity 0-10 Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) Score During the Last 14 Day of Treatment (End of Treatment),"The average spasticity NRS was completed at the same time each day, i.e. bedtime in the evening.

This study examined the cost-effectiveness of EMR-based CDS for adults with diabetes from the perspective of the health care system.
DATA SOURCES/SETTING: Clinical outcome and cost data from a randomized clinical trial of EMR-based CDS were used as inputs into a diabetes simulation model. The simulation cohort included 1,092 patients with diabetes with A1c above goal at baseline.
STUDY DESIGN: The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study Outcomes Model, a validated simulation model of diabetes, was used to evaluate remaining life years, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and health care costs over patient lifetimes (40-year time horizon) from the health system perspective.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Patients in the intervention group had significantly lowered A1c (0.26 percent, p = .014) relative to patients in the control arm. Intervention costs were $120 (SE = 45) per patient in the first year and $76 (SE = 45) per patient in the following years. In the base case analysis, EMR-based CDS increased lifetime QALYs by 0.04 (SE = 0.01) and increased lifetime costs by $112 (SE = 660), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $3,017 per QALY. The cost-effectiveness of EMR-based CDS persisted in one-way, two-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.

Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data were used to examine the incidence, manifestations, and survival in patients with melanoma with respect to race/ethnicity.
METHODS: A SEER search (1992-2002) for primary invasive cutaneous melanoma cases identified 48 143 whites, 932 Hispanics, 394 Asian/Pacific islanders, 251 African Americans, and 52 American Indians. Multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the relationship between race/ethnicity and clinicopathologic factors; associations between race/ethnicity and survival were examined using the Cox proportional hazards model.
RESULTS: Based on our cohort of patients, the average annual age-adjusted melanoma incidence per 100 000 persons was 18.4 for whites compared with 2.3, 0.8, 1.6, and 1.0 for Hispanics, African Americans, American Indians, and Asians, respectively. Lower extremity and acral lentiginous melanomas were more common among minorities. Overall 5-year survival was 72.2% to 81.1% for minorities compared with 89.6% for whites.

A convenience sample of 30 premature infants was selected from three neonatal intensive care units. A one-group repeated measures design was adopted for this study. The oxygen saturation of all subjects was first measured while they were receiving endotracheal suctioning during a four-hour control period with regular care. Then, four hours after the control period was completed, an experimental period began in which the music "" Transitions "" was played. One minute before suctioning, the level of oxygen saturation was measured to provide the baseline data. During a period of 30 minutes after suctioning, the oxygen saturation was recorded every minute to analyze the clinical effects of music therapy. The results showed that premature infants receiving music therapy with endotracheal suctioning had a significantly higher SPO(2); than that when not receiving music therapy (p <.01), and the level of oxygen saturation returned to the baseline level faster than when they did not receive music therapy (p <.01).

PURPOSE: To validate an optimized smoking cessation treatment package that comprises intervention components identified as effective in factorial screening experiments conducted as per the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST).
METHODS: Adult smokers motivated to quit were recruited from primary care clinics (N = 623). Participants were randomized to receive either recommended usual care (R-UC; 10 min of in-person counseling, 8 weeks of nicotine patch, and referral to quitline services) or abstinence-optimized treatment (A-OT; 3 weeks of prequit mini-lozenges, 26 weeks of nicotine patch + mini-lozenges, three in-person and eight phone counseling sessions, and 7-11 automated calls to prompt medication use). The key outcomes were self-reported and biochemically confirmed (carbon monoxide, CO <6 ppm) 7-day point-prevalence abstinence.
RESULTS: A-OT participants had significantly higher self-reported abstinence rates than R-UC participants at 4, 8, 16, and 26 weeks (ORs: 1.91-3.05; p <. 001). The biochemically confirmed 26-week abstinence rates were lower than the self-reported 26-week rates, but revealed a similar treatment effect size (OR = 2.94, p < .001).

Acceptance and commitment therapy, a promising intervention for cancer-related suffering, has rarely been applied to dyads coping with advanced cancer.
AIM: To examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of acceptance and commitment therapy for patient-caregiver dyads coping with advanced gastrointestinal cancer. Primary outcomes were patient fatigue interference and caregiver burden.
DESIGN: In this pilot trial, dyads were randomized to six weekly sessions of telephone-delivered acceptance and commitment therapy or education/support, an attention control. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and at 2 weeks and 3 months post-intervention.
SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Forty patients with stage III-IV gastrointestinal cancer and fatigue interference and family caregivers with burden or distress were recruited from two oncology clinics and randomized.
RESULTS: The eligibility screening rate (54%) and retention rate (81% at 2 weeks post-intervention) demonstrated feasibility. At 2 weeks post-intervention, acceptance and commitment therapy participants reported high intervention helpfulness (mean = 4.25/5.00). Group differences in outcomes were not statistically significant.

We randomized smokers to receive instructions for and rationale for stopping vs. continuing patch after a lapse. The messages were repeated before and after cessation and following lapses via counseling, phone and written instructions.
RESULTS: Among those who lapsed, those told to Continue Patch did not have a greater incidence of 7-day abstinence at 4months (primary outcome) than those told to Discontinue Patch (51% vs. 46%).

We compared the activity of panitumumab plus best supportive care (BSC) to that of BSC alone in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who had progressed after standard chemotherapy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We randomly assigned 463 patients with 1% or more EGFR tumor cell membrane staining, measurable disease, and radiologic documentation of disease progression during or within 6 months of most recent chemotherapy to panitumumab 6 mg/kg every 2 weeks plus BSC (n = 231) or BSC alone (n = 232). Tumor assessments by blinded central review were scheduled from week 8 until disease progression. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included objective response, overall survival (OS), and safety. BSC patients who progressed could receive panitumumab in a cross-over study.
RESULTS: Panitumumab significantly prolonged PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.54; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.66, [P < .0001]). Median PFS time was 8 weeks (95% CI, 7.9 to 8.4) for panitumumab and 7.3 weeks (95% CI, 7.1 to 7.7) for BSC. Mean (standard error) PFS time was 13.8 (0.8) weeks for panitumumab and 8.5 (0.5) weeks for BSC. Objective response rates also favored panitumumab over BSC; after a 12-month minimum follow-up, response rates were 10% for panitumumab and 0% for BSC (P < .0001).

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted in 20 normal term pregnant mothers. Ten foetuses were exposed to music and voice for 15 s at different sound pressure levels to find out the optimal setting for the auditory stimulation. Music, voice and sham were played to another 10 foetuses via a headphone on the maternal abdomen. The sound pressure level was 105 db and 94 db for music and voice, respectively. Computerised assessment of foetal heart rate and activity were recorded. 90 actocardiograms were obtained for the whole group. One way anova followed by posthoc (Student-Newman-Keuls method) analysis was used to find if there is significant difference in foetal response to music and voice versus sham.
RESULTS: Foetuses responded with heart rate acceleration and motor response to both music and voice. This was statistically significant compared to sham. There was no significant difference between the foetal heart rate acceleration to music and voice.

Combination immunotherapy with lenalidomide and rituximab is an immunomodulatory regimen that has shown promising activity in patients with indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
METHODS: We conducted this multicenter, international, phase 3 superiority trial to evaluate rituximab plus lenalidomide, as compared with rituximab plus chemotherapy, in patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma. Patients were randomly assigned to receive one of the two regimens, followed by maintenance monotherapy with rituximab. Treatment with rituximab plus lenalidomide consisted of 18 cycles of the two drugs, followed by rituximab maintenance therapy every 8 weeks for 12 cycles (six additional doses). Treatment with rituximab plus chemotherapy consisted of the investigator's choice of one of three rituximab-based regimens, followed by maintenance monotherapy with rituximab every 8 weeks for 12 cycles. The primary end points were complete response (confirmed or unconfirmed) at 120 weeks and progression-free survival.
RESULTS: A total of 1030 patients were randomly assigned to receive rituximab plus lenalidomide (513 patients) or rituximab plus chemotherapy (517 patients). The rate of confirmed or unconfirmed complete response at 120 weeks was similar in the two groups: 48% (95% confidence interval [CI], 44 to 53) in the rituximab-lenalidomide group and 53% (95% CI, 49 to 57) in the rituximab-chemotherapy group (P=0.13). The interim 3-year rate of progression-free survival was 77% (95% CI, 72 to 80) and 78% (95% CI, 74 to 82), respectively. A higher percentage of patients in the rituximab-chemotherapy group had grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (32% vs. 50%) and febrile neutropenia of any grade (2% vs. 7%), and a higher percentage of patients in the rituximab-lenalidomide group had grade 3 or 4 cutaneous reactions (7% vs. 1%).
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma, efficacy results were similar with rituximab plus lenalidomide and rituximab plus chemotherapy (with both regimens followed by rituximab maintenance therapy).

METHODS: We conducted a phase 2, double-blind, randomized controlled outpatient trial of favipiravir in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic adults with a positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR) within 72 hours of enrollment. Participants were randomized to receive placebo or favipiravir (1800 mg twice daily [BID] day 1, 800 mg BID days 2-10).

Given the high prevalence of chronic pain in the US, new strategies are needed to enhance access to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and other evidence-based treatments designed to facilitate self-management of chronic pain conditions. Although CBT is efficacious, many patients have limited or no access to CBT. Technology-assisted delivery of CBT may improve access while maintaining efficacy.
METHODS/DESIGN: We describe a randomized non-inferiority trial of interactive voice response (IVR)-based CBT for patients with chronic low back pain. This intervention uses daily IVR monitoring and weekly pre-recorded therapist feedback, based on patient-reported information, to provide treatment for patients at home. A total of 230 patients with chronic low back pain are being identified from a single statewide health system serving US military veterans. Participants are randomized to receive either ten weeks of in-person CBT or IVR-based CBT. The primary outcome is pain intensity as measured by the Numeric Rating Scale immediately post-treatment. Secondary outcomes include pain-related interference, emotional functioning, and quality of life measured immediately post treatment, and 6 and 9 months post recruitment. Exploratory objectives of the study are to examine: (1) potential mediators of impact on clinical outcomes (treatment retention, self-reported skill practice ratings, IVR call adherence, and treatment satisfaction); and (2) moderators of treatment engagement, adherence to therapist recommendations for pain coping skill practice, and effects on clinical outcomes.
DISCUSSION: This non-inferiority trial may identify an alternative to resource intensive in-person CBT that allows many more patients to receive care while also increasing retention of those enrolled in the program.

METHODS: In a prospective, multicenter, open-label, exploratory, randomized, 6-month study, 92 de novo renal transplant patients received everolimus, steroids, and basiliximab with low or standard tacrolimus exposure. The primary objective was to compare renal function at 6 months after transplant.
RESULTS: Mean 6-month serum creatinine (primary safety variable) was 112+/-31 micromol/L (1.26+/-0.35 mg/dL) and 127+/-50 micromol/L (1.44+/-0.57 mg/dL) in the low and standard tacrolimus groups, respectively, (n.s.); mean estimated GFR (Nankivell) was 75.3+/-16.6 mL/min and 72.5+/-15.2 mL/min (n.s.).

METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of the association between tumor HPV status and survival among patients with stage III or IV oropharyngeal squamous-cell carcinoma who were enrolled in a randomized trial comparing accelerated-fractionation radiotherapy (with acceleration by means of concomitant boost radiotherapy) with standard-fractionation radiotherapy, each combined with cisplatin therapy, in patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Proportional-hazards models were used to compare the risk of death among patients with HPV-positive cancer and those with HPV-negative cancer.
RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 4.8 years. The 3-year rate of overall survival was similar in the group receiving accelerated-fractionation radiotherapy and the group receiving standard-fractionation radiotherapy (70.3% vs. 64.3%; P=0.18; hazard ratio for death with accelerated-fractionation radiotherapy, 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72 to 1.13), as were the rates of high-grade acute and late toxic events. A total of 63.8% of patients with oropharyngeal cancer (206 of 323) had HPV-positive tumors; these patients had better 3-year rates of overall survival (82.4%, vs. 57.1% among patients with HPV-negative tumors; P<0.001 by the log-rank test) and, after adjustment for age, race, tumor and nodal stage, tobacco exposure, and treatment assignment, had a 58% reduction in the risk of death (hazard ratio, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.66). The risk of death significantly increased with each additional pack-year of tobacco smoking. Using recursive-partitioning analysis, we classified our patients as having a low, intermediate, or high risk of death on the basis of four factors: HPV status, pack-years of tobacco smoking, tumor stage, and nodal stage.

This review of the published literature was undertaken to assess the effect of such programs on pain and disability.
METHODS: Medline and HealthSTAR were searched for the period 1964-1998. The references of each article were then hand-searched for further publications. Studies were included in the meta-analysis if the intervention contained a self-management education component, a concurrent control group was included, and pain and/or disability were assessed as end points. Two authors reviewed each study. The methodologic attributes and efficacy of the interventions were assessed using a standardized abstraction tool, and the magnitude of the results was converted to a common measure, the effect size. Summary effect sizes were calculated separately for pain and disability.
RESULTS: The search strategy yielded 35 studies, of which 17 met inclusion criteria. The mean age of study participants was 61 years, and 69% were female. On average, 19% of patients did not complete followup (range 0-53%). The summary effect size was 0.12 for pain (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.00, 0.24) and 0.07 for disability (95% CI 0.00, 0.15). Funnel plots indicated no significant evidence of bias toward the publication of studies with findings that showed reductions in pain or disability.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers an evidence-based behavioral weight management intervention called MOVE!, mostly delivered through in-person group sessions. Few eligible Veterans participate due to factors like distance and preferences, mirroring barriers in the general population. Practical alternatives to standard in-person programs are needed to improve access and engagement. A self-directed lifestyle intervention called D-ELITE-delivered through pre-recorded videos by DVD or online streaming-previously efficacious in a general primary care population, may provide such an alternative. This pragmatic clinical trial will evaluate whether D-ELITE improves weight and general health status among Veterans with obesity, relative to VA usual care. The yearlong intervention includes one orientation by phone, supplemental lifestyle coaching primarily via technology-based messages, 12 DVD or online streaming sessions over 3 months, and continued self-directed weight management for months 4-12. Participants use MyFitnessPal.com or paper booklets for self-monitoring weight, diet, and physical activity. Follow-up assessments at 12 and 24 months are administered by mail or phone.

The underlying mechanism(s) may involve chronic low-grade systemic inflammation and immune cell activation. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (sitagliptin) improve glucose tolerance and may possess immunomodulatory effects because leukocyte CD26 cell surface receptors express dipeptidyl peptidase-4 activity.
OBJECTIVE: Sitagliptin will reduce inflammatory and immune cell activation markers known to be elevated in cART-treated HIV-infected (HIV+) adults with impaired glucose tolerance.
DESIGN: This was designed as a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of sitagliptin in HIV+ adults.
SETTING: The setting was an academic medical center.
PATIENTS: Patients were cART-treated HIV+ men and women (n = 36) with stable HIV disease and impaired glucose tolerance.
INTERVENTIONS: Interventions included sitagliptin 100 mg/d or placebo for 8 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: At baseline and week 8, plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and C-X-C motif chemokine 10 concentrations (ELISA), oral glucose tolerance, and abdominal sc adipose mRNA expression for M1 macrophage markers (monocyte chemotactic protein-1, EGF-like module-containing, mucin-like hormone receptor 1).
RESULTS: Sitagliptin reduced glucose area under the curve (P = .002) and improved oral glucose insulin sensitivity index (P = .04) more than placebo. Sitagliptin reduced plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and C-X-C motif chemokine 10 levels more than placebo (P < .009). Adipose tissue monocyte chemotactic protein-1 mRNA abundance declined significantly more (P = .01), and adipose EGF-like module-containing, mucin-like hormone receptor 1 mRNA expression tended to decline more (P = .19) in sitagliptin than placebo.

Pharmacological treatment options, including antipsychotics are not satisfactory.
OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of citalopram for agitation in patients with Alzheimer disease. Key secondary objectives examined effects of citalopram on function, caregiver distress, safety, cognitive safety, and tolerability.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Citalopram for Agitation in Alzheimer Disease Study (CitAD) was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group trial that enrolled 186 patients with probable Alzheimer disease and clinically significant agitation from 8 academic centers in the United States and Canada from August 2009 to January 2013.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants (n = 186) were randomized to receive a psychosocial intervention plus either citalopram (n = 94) or placebo (n = 92) for 9 weeks. Dosage began at 10 mg per day with planned titration to 30 mg per day over 3 weeks based on response and tolerability.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome measures were based on scores from the 18-point Neurobehavioral Rating Scale agitation subscale (NBRS-A) and the modified Alzheimer Disease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change (mADCS-CGIC). Other outcomes were based on scores from the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), ability to complete activities of daily living (ADLs), caregiver distress, cognitive safety (based on scores from the 30-point Mini Mental State Examination [MMSE]), and adverse events.
RESULTS: Participants who received citalopram showed significant improvement compared with those who received placebo on both primary outcome measures. The NBRS-A estimated treatment difference at week 9 (citalopram minus placebo) was -0.93 (95% CI, -1.80 to -0.06), P = .04. Results from the mADCS-CGIC showed 40% of citalopram participants having moderate or marked improvement from baseline compared with 26% of placebo recipients, with estimated treatment effect (odds ratio [OR] of being at or better than a given CGIC category) of 2.13 (95% CI, 1.23-3.69), P = .01. Participants who received citalopram showed significant improvement on the CMAI, total NPI, and caregiver distress scores but not on the NPI agitation subscale, ADLs, or in less use of rescue lorazepam. Worsening of cognition (-1.05 points; 95% CI, -1.97 to -0.13; P = .03) and QT interval prolongation (18.1 ms; 95% CI, 6.1-30.1; P = .01) were seen in the citalopram group.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with probable Alzheimer disease and agitation who were receiving psychosocial intervention, the addition of citalopram compared with placebo significantly reduced agitation and caregiver distress; however, cognitive and cardiac adverse effects of citalopram may limit its practical application at the dosage of 30 mg per day.

OBJECTIVE: To compare continued once-weekly treatment with subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg, with switch to placebo for weight maintenance (both with lifestyle intervention) in adults with overweight or obesity after a 20-week run-in with subcutaneous semaglutide titrated to 2.4 mg weekly.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized, double-blind, 68-week phase 3a withdrawal study conducted at 73 sites in 10 countries from June 2018 to March 2020 in adults with body mass index of at least 30 (or ≥27 with ≥1 weight-related comorbidity) and without diabetes.
INTERVENTIONS: A total of 902 participants received once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide during run-in. After 20 weeks (16 weeks of dose escalation; 4 weeks of maintenance dose), 803 participants (89.0%) who reached the 2.4-mg/wk semaglutide maintenance dose were randomized (2:1) to 48 weeks of continued subcutaneous semaglutide (n = 535) or switched to placebo (n = 268), plus lifestyle intervention in both groups.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was percent change in body weight from week 20 to week 68; confirmatory secondary end points were changes in waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, and physical functioning (assessed using the Short Form 36 Version 2 Health Survey, Acute Version [SF-36]).
RESULTS: Among 803 study participants who completed the 20-week run-in period (with a mean weight loss of 10.6%) and were randomized (mean age, 46 [SD, 12] years; 634 [79%] women; mean body weight, 107.2 kg [SD, 22.7 kg]), 787 participants (98.0%) completed the trial and 741 (92.3%) completed treatment. With continued semaglutide, mean body weight change from week 20 to week 68 was -7.9% vs +6.9% with the switch to placebo (difference, -14.8 [95% CI, -16.0 to -13.5] percentage points; P < .001). Waist circumference (-9.7 cm [95% CI, -10.9 to -8.5 cm]), systolic blood pressure (-3.9 mm Hg [95% CI, -5.8 to -2.0 mm Hg]), and SF-36 physical functioning score (2.5 [95% CI, 1.6-3.3]) also improved with continued subcutaneous semaglutide vs placebo (all P < .001). Gastrointestinal events were reported in 49.1% of participants who continued subcutaneous semaglutide vs 26.1% with placebo; similar proportions discontinued treatment because of adverse events with continued semaglutide (2.4%) and placebo (2.2%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among adults with overweight or obesity who completed a 20-week run-in period with subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg once weekly, maintaining treatment with semaglutide compared with switching to placebo resulted in continued weight loss over the following 48 weeks.

Week 12,20518806,Dapagliflozin treatment in patients with different stages of type 2 diabetes mellitus: effects on glycaemic control and body weight.,"AIM: Dapagliflozin is a stable, competitive, reversible, and highly selective inhibitor of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2, the major transporter responsible for renal glucose reabsorption. With an insulin-independent mechanism of action, dapagliflozin is currently being developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This work aims to compare the efficacy of dapagliflozin, as measured by the change in hemoglobin A1c concentration (A1c) and body weight, and to determine the pharmacodynamic effects of dapagliflozin, as measured by urinary glucose excretion in early-stage and late-stage T2DM patient populations.
METHODS: A total of 151 early-stage patients and 58 late-stage patients with T2DM randomly assigned 10 or 20 mg once daily (QD) dapagliflozin treatment or placebo for 12 weeks from two phase 2 studies were included in the analysis. A1c, body weight, and urinary glucose were compared between the two patient populations.
RESULTS: Compared with the early-stage population, patients in the late-stage population had a longer duration of T2DM and higher baseline levels of A1c, body weight, fasting plasma glucose, and urinary glucose excretion. After 12 weeks of dapagliflozin treatment, A1c reduction, weight loss, and increased urinary glucose excretion from baseline were observed in both populations. Baseline A1c level impacted the A1c reduction after dapagliflozin treatment with a comparable effect in patients with early and late stage disease. Late-stage patients had greater reduction in body weight. There was no statistically significant difference in the amount of urinary glucose excretion between the early-stage and late-stage patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin treatment at 10 and 20 mg QD for 12 weeks resulted in significant improvement in glycaemic control and body weight reduction in both early-stage and late-stage patients with T2DM.

METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of a multicenter trial of vitamin C and E for prevention of pregnancy-associated hypertension in low-risk nulliparous women. Laboratory abnormalities included: platelets less than 100,000/mm, aspartate aminotransferase 100 units/L or greater, creatinine 1.5 mg/dL or greater, lactate dehydrogenase 600 units/L or greater, total bilirubin 1.2 mg/dL or greater, or evidence of hemolysis on peripheral smear. Mild pregnancy-associated hypertension was defined as blood pressure 140-159/90-109 mm Hg. Severe pregnancy-associated hypertension was defined as persistent blood pressure 160/110 mm Hg or greater, acute antihypertensive treatment, or any blood pressure elevation associated with clinical signs of end-organ dysfunction (one or more of headache, epigastric pain, blurred vision, pulmonary edema, eclampsia, or oliguria). Pregnancy outcomes were compared across four groups: I, mild hypertension alone; II, mild hypertension+abnormal laboratory values; III, severe pregnancy-associated hypertension alone; and IV, severe pregnancy-associated hypertension+abnormal laboratory values.
RESULTS: Of 9,969 women, 2,752 (27.9%) developed pregnancy-associated hypertension and of these, laboratory abnormalities occurred in 7.3%. Laboratory abnormalities increased with severity of hypertension: mild hypertension alone (4.9%), severe hypertension alone (8.9%), and mild or severe hypertension with clinical signs of end-organ dysfunction (12.2%) (P for trend<.001). Compared with women with mild hypertension alone, the adjusted odds for the perinatal composite (2-fold to 4.8-fold in Category III-IV), preterm birth (2.1-fold to 7.8-fold in Category II-IV), and other adverse perinatal outcomes increase with disease severity, particularly with laboratory abnormalities and severe clinical signs.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate elbasvir-grazoprevir in treating HCV infection in PWID.
DESIGN: Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02105688).
SETTING: Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Israel, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
PATIENTS: 301 treatment-naive patients with chronic HCV genotype 1, 4, or 6 infection who were at least 80% adherent to visits for opioid agonist therapy (OAT).
INTERVENTION: The immediate-treatment group (ITG) received elbasvir-grazoprevir for 12 weeks; the deferred-treatment group (DTG) received placebo for 12 weeks, no treatment for 4 weeks, then open-label elbasvir-grazoprevir for 12 weeks.
MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was sustained virologic response at 12 weeks (SVR12), evaluated separately in the ITG and DTG. Other outcomes included SVR24, viral recurrence or reinfection, and adverse events.
RESULTS: The SVR12 was 91.5% (95% CI, 86.8% to 95.0%) in the ITG and 89.5% (95% CI, 81.5% to 94.8%) in the active phase of the DTG. Drug use at baseline and during treatment did not affect SVR12 or adherence to HCV therapy. Among 18 patients with posttreatment viral recurrence through 24-week follow-up, 6 had probable reinfection. If the probable reinfections were assumed to be responses, SVR12 was 94.0% (CI, 89.8% to 96.9%) in the ITG. One patient in the ITG (1 of 201) and 1 in the placebo-phase DTG (1 of 100) discontinued treatment because of an adverse event.
LIMITATION: These findings may not be generalizable to PWID who are not receiving OAT, nor do they apply to persons with genotype 3 infection, a common strain in PWID.
CONCLUSION: Patients with HCV infection who were receiving OAT and treated with elbasvir-grazoprevir had high rates of SVR12, regardless of ongoing drug use. These results support the removal of drug use as a barrier to interferon-free HCV treatment for patients receiving OAT.

This facilitates glucose and insulin delivery to muscle, thus augmenting glucose uptake. In obese rats, both insulin-mediated microvascular recruitment and glucose uptake are diminished; however, this action of insulin has not been studied in obese humans. Here we used contrast ultrasound to measure microvascular blood volume (MBV) (an index of microvascular recruitment) in the forearm flexor muscles of lean and obese adults before and after a 120-min euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic (1 mU . min(-1) . kg(-1)) clamp. We also measured brachial artery flow, fasting lipid profile, and anthropomorphic variables. Fasting plasma glucose (5.4 +/- 0.1 vs. 5.1 +/- 0.1 mmol/l, P = 0.05), insulin (79 +/- 11 vs. 38 +/- 6 pmol/l, P = 0.003), and percent body fat (44 +/- 2 vs. 25 +/- 2%, P = 0.001) were higher in the obese than the lean adults. After 2 h of insulin infusion, whole-body glucose infusion rate was significantly lower in the obese versus lean group (19.3 +/- 3.2 and 37.4 +/- 2.6 mumol . min(-1) . kg(-1) respectively, P < 0.001). Compared with baseline, insulin increased MBV in the lean (18.7 +/- 3.3 to 25.0 +/- 4.1, P = 0.019) but not in the obese group (20.4 +/- 3.6 to 18.8 +/- 3.8, NS). Insulin increased brachial artery diameter and flow in the lean but not in the obese group. We observed a significant, negative correlation between DeltaMBV and BMI (R = -0.482, P = 0.027) in response to insulin.

NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE ACTION: The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute convened a working group to identify areas of research needed in TRALI. The working group identified the immediate need for a common definition and thus developed the clinical definition in this report.
MAJOR CONCEPTS IN THE DEFINITION: The major concept is that TRALI is defined as new acute lung injury occurring during or within 6 hrs after a transfusion, with a clear temporal relationship to the transfusion. Also, another important concept is that acute lung injury temporally associated with multiple transfusions can be TRALI, because each unit of blood or blood component can carry one or more of the possible causative agents: antileukocyte antibody, biologically active substances, and other yet unidentified agents.
RECOMMENDATION: Using the definition in this report, clinicians can diagnose and report TRALI cases to the blood bank; importantly, researchers can use this definition to determine incidence, pathophysiology, and strategies to prevent this leading cause of transfusion-associated mortality.",2,PRIMARY,Platelets Blood Product Transfusion,"The number of subject's who received 0,1,2,3 or more units of Platelets transfused from completion of study drug administration though midnight of the next day.",Prothrombin Complex Concentrate,Fresh Frozen Plasma,"After cardiopulmonary bypass, patients received protamine at dose 0.01 mg/unit of heparin given with target activated clotting time (ACT) within 10% of baseline value.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: At six clinical centers in four countries, 30 participants 18-66 years old with type 1 diabetes (43% female, 96% non-Hispanic white, median type 1 diabetes duration 19 years, median A1C 7.3%) completed the study. The protocol included a 2-week baseline sensor-augmented pump (SAP) period followed by 2 weeks of overnight-only CLC and 2 weeks of 24/7 CLC at home. Glucose control during CLC was compared with the baseline SAP.
RESULTS: Glycemic control parameters for overnight-only CLC were improved during the nighttime period compared with baseline for hypoglycemia (time <70 mg/dL, primary end point median 1.1% vs. 3.0%; P < 0.001), time in target (70-180 mg/dL: 75% vs. 61%; P < 0.001), and glucose variability (coefficient of variation: 30% vs. 36%; P < 0.001).

Previous studies have suggested a benefit for memantine on agitation and aggression, but none have examined its efficacy in community-dwelling patients with significant agitation and aggression at baseline, utilizing these behaviors as a primary outcome measure.
METHODS: Patients with moderate-to-severe AD with Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) total score ≥13 and NPI agitation/aggression score ≥1 were randomized to placebo or 20-mg memantine in a double-blind, 24-week trial. Co-primary outcome measures were behavior, measured by total NPI score, and cognition, using the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB). Secondary outcome measures included global assessment, function and other measures of behavior. This trial was registered as Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00857649.
RESULTS: A total of 369 patients (average age = 75, average MMSE = 12) were randomized to placebo or memantine. The study was prematurely terminated due to recruitment problems.

This study investigated whether cigarette demand predicted response to contingent monetary rewards for abstinence among individuals with substance use disorders. It also sought to replicate evidence for greater price sensitivity at whole-dollar pack price transitions (ie, left-digit effects).
METHODS: Participants (N = 338) were individuals in residential substance use disorder treatment who participated in a randomized controlled trial that compared contingent vouchers to noncontingent vouchers for smoking abstinence. Baseline demand indices were used to predict number of abstinent days during the 14-day voucher period (after the reduction lead-in) and at 1 and 3 months afterward.
RESULTS: Demand indices correlated with measures of smoking and nicotine dependence. As measured by elasticity, intensity and O max, higher demand significantly predicted fewer abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings during voucher period for individuals in the noncontingent vouchers condition. Breakpoint exhibited a trend-level association with abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings. Demand indices did not predict abstinence in the contingent vouchers group, and did not predict abstinence at 1- and 3-month follow-ups. Left-digit price transitions were associated with significantly greater reductions in consumption.
CONCLUSIONS: The association of cigarette demand with smoking behavior only in the group for whom abstinence was not incentivized indicates that CPT assesses the value of smoking more than the value of money per se and that vouchers counteract the effects of the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes. Results provide initial short-term evidence of predictive validity for the CPT indices.
IMPLICATIONS: This study provides the first evidence of the validity of the CPT for predicting early response to brief advice for smoking cessation plus nicotine replacement in smokers with substance dependence. However, demand for cigarettes did not predict voucher-based treatment response, indicating that incentives serve as a powerful motivator not to smoke that acts in opposition to the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes and that the indices reflect the value of smoking more than the value of money per se.",0,PRIMARY,Number of Participants With Relapse to Any Heavy Drinking,Heavy drinking = 6 or more drinks for men; 5 or more drinks for women,Contingency Management (CM),Noncontingent Reinforcement (NR),"Condition provides contingent monetary reinforcement for smoking reductions (first 5 days) then for smoking abstinence (subsequent 14 days).

METHODS: Systematic searches of the bibliographic databases Medline, Embase, Cinahl, Chemical Abstracts, Cochrane and Web of Science for RCTs concerning diacerein treatment of OA.
INCLUSION CRITERIA: explicit statement about randomization to either diacerein or placebo, and co-primary outcomes being reduction in pain and improvement in function. Efficacy effect size (ES) was estimated using Hedges's standardized mean difference. Safety was measured via the risk ratio (RR) of patients having at least one episode of diarrhoea, or withdrawal due to adverse events. Trials were combined by using random-effects meta-analysis. Consistency was evaluated via the I-squared index.
RESULTS: Six trials (seven sub-studies; 1533 patients) contributed to the meta-analysis, revealing a large degree of inconsistency among the trials (I(2)=56%) in regard to pain reduction: the combined ES was -0.24 [95% confidence intervals (CI): -0.39 to -0.08, P=0.003], favouring diacerein. The statistically significant improvement in function (P=0.01) was based on a small amount of heterogeneity (I(2)=11%), but presented a questionable clinical effect size (ES=-0.14). Risk of publication bias could not be excluded, and trials with duration of more than 6 months did not favour diacerein.

In this trial, we assessed the efficacy and safety of nerinetide in human ischaemia-reperfusion that occurs with rapid endovascular thrombectomy in patients who had an acute ischaemic stroke.
METHODS: For this multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study done in 48 acute care hospitals in eight countries, we enrolled patients with acute ischaemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion within a 12 h treatment window. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with a disabling ischaemic stroke at the time of randomisation, had been functioning independently in the community before the stroke, had an Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) greater than 4, and vascular imaging showing moderate-to-good collateral filling, as determined by multiphase CT angiography. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous nerinetide in a single dose of 2·6 mg/kg, up to a maximum dose of 270 mg, on the basis of estimated or actual weight (if known) or saline placebo by use of a real-time, dynamic, internet-based, stratified randomised minimisation procedure. Patients were stratified by intravenous alteplase treatment and declared endovascular device choice. All trial personnel and patients were masked to sequence and treatment allocation. All patients underwent endovascular thrombectomy and received alteplase in usual care when indicated. The primary outcome was a favourable functional outcome 90 days after randomisation, defined as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-2. Secondary outcomes were measures of neurological disability, functional independence in activities of daily living, excellent functional outcome (mRS 0-1), and mortality. The analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population and adjusted for age, sex, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, ASPECTS, occlusion location, site, alteplase use, and declared first device. The safety population included all patients who received any amount of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02930018.
FINDINGS: Between March 1, 2017, and Aug 12, 2019, 1105 patients were randomly assigned to receive nerinetide (n=549) or placebo (n=556). 337 (61·4%) of 549 patients with nerinetide and 329 (59·2%) of 556 with placebo achieved an mRS score of 0-2 at 90 days (adjusted risk ratio 1·04, 95% CI 0·96-1·14; p=0·35). Secondary outcomes were similar between groups. We observed evidence of treatment effect modification resulting in inhibition of treatment effect in patients receiving alteplase. Serious adverse events occurred equally between groups.

We evaluated oral immunotherapy using egg-white powder for the treatment of children with egg allergy.
METHODS: In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, 55 children, 5 to 11 years of age, with egg allergy received oral immunotherapy (40 children) or placebo (15). Initial dose-escalation, build-up, and maintenance phases were followed by an oral food challenge with egg-white powder at 10 months and at 22 months. Children who successfully passed the challenge at 22 months discontinued oral immunotherapy and avoided all egg consumption for 4 to 6 weeks. At 24 months, these children underwent an oral food challenge with egg-white powder and a cooked egg to test for sustained unresponsiveness. Children who passed this challenge at 24 months were placed on a diet with ad libitum egg consumption and were evaluated for continuation of sustained unresponsiveness at 30 months and 36 months.
RESULTS: After 10 months of therapy, none of the children who received placebo and 55% of those who received oral immunotherapy passed the oral food challenge and were considered to be desensitized; after 22 months, 75% of children in the oral-immunotherapy group were desensitized. In the oral-immunotherapy group, 28% (11 of 40 children) passed the oral food challenge at 24 months and were considered to have sustained unresponsiveness. At 30 months and 36 months, all children who had passed the oral food challenge at 24 months were consuming egg. Of the immune markers measured, small wheal diameters on skin-prick testing and increases in egg-specific IgG4 antibody levels were associated with passing the oral food challenge at 24 months.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten localized prostate cancer patients were prescribed to 79.2Gy in 44 fractions. Static IMRT plans using five and seven equiangular-spaced beams were generated. The starting gantry angles were incremented by 5 degrees resulting in 15 (5 beams) and 11 (7 beams) plans per patient. Constant target coverage was ensured for all plans in order to isolate the variation in the rectal and bladder metrics as a function of starting gantry angle.
RESULTS: The variation with starting gantry angle in rectal metrics using 5 beams was statistically significant (p<0.001) with dosimetric importance. The 5-beam rectal V 75Gy and V 70Gy demonstrated a class solution with a characteristic 'W' pattern and two optimal starting gantry angles near 20 degrees and 50 degrees . Statistically insignificant differences were observed for the bladder metrics using 5 beams. There was little dosimetric variation in the rectal and bladder metrics with 7 beams. Nearly equivalent rectal V 75Gy was achieved between 5 optimal equiangular-spaced beams starting at 20 degrees (class solution) and 7 equiangular-spaced beams starting at 0 degrees for most patients.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine discs in 26 patients with contained lumbar disc herniation treated by laser were included. Laser intervention was performed using Ho:YAG laser system. The results were quantitatively analysed by measuring areal changes of the herniated mass on axial T1-weighted images and signal changes within the disc on sagittal T2-weighted images. Clinical outcomes were evaluated according to Japanese Orthopaedic Association score (JOA score), and recovery rates based on JOA score immediately and 1 year after treatment were calculated.
RESULTS: The recovery rate immediately after treatment was 53.1%, and increasing to 64.6% 1 year later. The size of the disc herniation ranged from 7% to 55% of the axial cross-section of the spinal canal pre-operatively and no significant changes were noted postoperatively. Also no correlation was found between the pre-operative herniation size and the recovery rate. The signal changes within the disc increased significantly after treatment, but no correlation was present between the signal changes and the recovery rate.

DESIGN: In vivo biochemical analyses after filler injections.
SETTING: Academic referral center.
PARTICIPANTS: Eleven healthy volunteers (mean age, 74 years) with photodamaged forearm skin. Interventions Filler and vehicle (isotonic sodium chloride) injected into forearm skin and skin biopsy specimens taken 4 and 13 weeks later.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: De novo synthesis of collagen, the major structural protein of dermal extracellular matrix, was assessed using immunohistochemical analysis, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and electron microscopy.
RESULTS: Compared with controls, immunostaining in skin receiving cross-linked hyaluronic acid injections revealed increased collagen deposition around the filler. Staining for prolyl-4-hydroxylase and the C-terminal and N-terminal epitopes of type I procollagen was enhanced at 4 and 13 weeks after treatment (P<.05). Gene expression for types I and III procollagen as well as several profibrotic growth factors was also up-regulated at 4 and 13 weeks compared with controls (P<.05). Fibroblasts in filler-injected skin demonstrated a mechanically stretched appearance and a biosynthetic phenotype. In vitro, fibroblasts did not bind the filler, suggesting that cross-linked hyaluronic acid is not directly stimulatory.
CONCLUSIONS: Injection of cross-linked hyaluronic acid stimulates collagen synthesis, partially restoring dermal matrix components that are lost in photodamaged skin. We hypothesize that this stimulatory effect may be induced by mechanical stretching of the dermis, which in turn leads to stretching and activation of dermal fibroblasts.

METHODS: In this event-driven, phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned 1156 patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension to receive placebo or selexipag in individualized doses (maximum dose, 1600 μg twice daily). Patients were eligible for enrollment if they were not receiving treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension or if they were receiving a stable dose of an endothelin-receptor antagonist, a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, or both. The primary end point was a composite of death from any cause or a complication related to pulmonary arterial hypertension up to the end of the treatment period (defined for each patient as 7 days after the date of the last intake of selexipag or placebo).
RESULTS: A primary end-point event occurred in 397 patients--41.6% of those in the placebo group and 27.0% of those in the selexipag group (hazard ratio in the selexipag group as compared with the placebo group, 0.60; 99% confidence interval, 0.46 to 0.78; P<0.001). Disease progression and hospitalization accounted for 81.9% of the events. The effect of selexipag with respect to the primary end point was similar in the subgroup of patients who were not receiving treatment for the disease at baseline and in the subgroup of patients who were already receiving treatment at baseline (including those who were receiving a combination of two therapies). By the end of the study, 105 patients in the placebo group and 100 patients in the selexipag group had died from any cause. Overall, 7.1% of patients in the placebo group and 14.3% of patients in the selexipag group discontinued their assigned regimen prematurely because of adverse events. The most common adverse events in the selexipag group were consistent with the known side effects of prostacyclin, including headache, diarrhea, nausea, and jaw pain.
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, the risk of the primary composite end point of death or a complication related to pulmonary arterial hypertension was significantly lower with selexipag than with placebo.

This balance is disrupted in menopause, producing vasomotor symptoms (VMSs).
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate safety and efficacy of the NK3R antagonist fezolinetant in menopausal VMSs.
DESIGN: Twelve-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.
SETTING: Eight Belgian centers from September 2015 to October 2016.
PARTICIPANTS: Generally healthy menopausal women aged 40 to 65 years with moderate/severe VMSs.
INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were randomized (1:1) to 90 mg of fezolinetant twice daily or placebo for 12 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Subjects captured VMS severity and frequency using an electronic diary. The primary outcome was change from baseline to week 12 in total VMS score with fezolinetant vs placebo. Secondary outcomes included timing of changes in frequency and severity of moderate/severe VMSs and quality-of-life assessments at weeks 4, 8, and 12. Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic effects were assessed, as were safety and tolerability.
RESULTS: Of 122 subjects screened, 87 were randomized and 80 (92%) completed the study. At week 12, fezolinetant significantly reduced total VMS score vs placebo (-26.5 vs -12.2, P < 0.001) and decreased mean frequency of moderate/severe VMSs by five episodes per day vs placebo. Severity and frequency of moderate/severe VMSs were reduced from the first day of treatment. Improvements were achieved in all quality-of-life measures. Fezolinetant was well tolerated.

Here we examined the effectiveness of single-session informational counseling with single-session performance-perceptual counseling.
DESIGN: Two forms of counseling were compared: informational counseling (IC) and performance-perceptual counseling (PPC). IC focused on discussing communication strategies and tips for hearing-aid use. PPC addressed the discrepancy between measured and perceived ability to understand speech. Outcomes were measured eight-to-ten weeks post-counseling using quantitative and qualitative measures: Hearing handicap inventory, abbreviated profile of hearing aid benefit, psychosocial impact of assistive devices scale (PIADS), international outcome inventory for hearing aids, and a semi-structured exit interview.
STUDY SAMPLE: Seventy-four hearing aid-users with symmetrical sensorineural hearing loss participated.
RESULTS: Scores on the hearing questionnaires showed no change following either form of counseling. Scores on the PIADS improved for participants as a whole, and the semi-structured interview revealed increased hearing-aid use, better understanding and acceptance of hearing loss, increased use of communication strategies, and improved ability to explain hearing difficulties to others.

METHODS: Two studies were performed in a prospective, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Fifty adult (study p520, aged 16-44 years) and 49 paediatric patients (study p521, 4-15 years) with recent-onset T1D were treated subcutaneously at four different time points with 0.2 mg or 1.0 mg DiaPep277 versus placebo and followed for 18 months. Adult patients were treated with 0.2 mg, 1.0 mg or 2.5 mg DiaPep277 versus placebo. Stimulated C-peptide served as readout for functional beta-cell-mass.
RESULTS: DiaPep277-treatment was not associated with severe side effects. No differences were found in placebo and DiaPep277 treated groups. In adults, a modest trend towards better maintenance of beta-cell function was observed in the 0.2 mg and 1.0 mg group, while there was significant loss of stimulated C-peptide in the placebo and 2.5 mg group.

METHODS: A single 50 mg dose of dapagliflozin was used to assess pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in five groups: healthy non-diabetic subjects; patients with T2DM and normal kidney function and patients with T2DM and mild, moderate or severe renal impairment based on estimated creatinine clearance. Subsequently, 20 mg once daily multiple doses of dapagliflozin were evaluated in the patients with T2DM. Formation rates of dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide (D3OG), an inactive metabolite, were evaluated using human isolated kidney and liver microsomes.
RESULTS: Plasma concentrations of dapagliflozin and D3OG were incrementally increased with declining kidney function. Steady-state Cmax for dapagliflozin were 4%, 6% and 9% higher and for D3OG were 20%, 37% and 52% higher in patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, respectively, compared with normal function.

We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the association between air pollution and acute decompensated heart failure including hospitalisation and heart failure mortality.
METHODS: Five databases were searched for studies investigating the association between daily increases in gaseous (carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone) and particulate (diameter <2·5 μm [PM2·5] or <10 μm [PM10]) air pollutants, and heart failure hospitalisations or heart failure mortality. We used a random-effects model to derive overall risk estimates per pollutant.
FINDINGS: Of 1146 identified articles, 195 were reviewed in-depth with 35 satisfying inclusion criteria. Heart failure hospitalisation or death was associated with increases in carbon monoxide (3·52% per 1 part per million; 95% CI 2·52-4·54), sulphur dioxide (2·36% per 10 parts per billion; 1·35-3·38), and nitrogen dioxide (1·70% per 10 parts per billion; 1·25-2·16), but not ozone (0·46% per 10 parts per billion; -0·10 to 1·02) concentrations. Increases in particulate matter concentration were associated with heart failure hospitalisation or death (PM2·5 2·12% per 10 μg/m(3), 95% CI 1·42-2·82; PM10 1·63% per 10 μg/m(3), 95% CI 1·20-2·07). Strongest associations were seen on the day of exposure, with more persistent effects for PM2·5. In the USA, we estimate that a mean reduction in PM2·5 of 3·9 μg/m(3) would prevent 7978 heart failure hospitalisations and save a third of a billion US dollars a year.
INTERPRETATION: Air pollution has a close temporal association with heart failure hospitalisation and heart failure mortality. Although more studies from developing nations are required, air pollution is a pervasive public health issue with major cardiovascular and health economic consequences, and it should remain a key target for global health policy.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 155 subjects of Mexican-American origin (58 male and 97 female, aged 18-70 years, BMI 20-65 kg/m(2)) with normal glucose tolerance (n = 100) or impaired glucose tolerance (n = 55) were studied. Each subject received a 75-g OGTT and a euglycemic insulin clamp in combination with tritiated glucose. The OGTT-derived indexes of muscle and hepatic insulin sensitivity were compared with hepatic and muscle insulin sensitivity, which was directly measured with the insulin clamp, by correlation analysis.
RESULTS: The product of total area under curve (AUC) for glucose and insulin during the first 30 min of the OGTT (glucose(0-30)[AUC] x insulin(0-30)[AUC]) strongly correlated with the hepatic insulin resistance index (fasting plasma insulin x basal endogenous glucose production) (r = 0.64, P < 0.0001).

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the maintenance of efficacy of Sativex in subjects who have gained long-term symptomatic relief of spasticity in multiple sclerosis (MS), and to assess the impact of sudden medicine withdrawal.
METHODS: An enriched enrolment randomized withdrawal study design was used. Eligible subjects with ongoing benefit from Sativex for at least 12 weeks entered this 5-week placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomized withdrawal study. Each subjects' previous effective and tolerated dose was continued.
RESULTS: A total of 18 subjects per group were enrolled.

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, phase III trial.
METHODS: Patients with ABRS defined by clinical, radiologic, and bacteriologic criteria were recruited to the study. Study treatments were 400 mg of oral moxifloxacin or a matching placebo daily for 5 days. The primary end point was clinical response at test-of-cure, 1 to 3 days after the end of therapy in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population (patients with positive culture for one of five prespecified pathogens). Secondary efficacy variables included patient-reported symptom improvement measured using the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-16 (SNOT-16), and concomitant medication use.
RESULTS: The mITT population consisted of 118 patients (moxifloxacin, n = 73; placebo, n = 45). Clinical success rates were numerically higher for moxifloxacin (78.1%, 57/73) versus placebo (66.7%, 30/45); (P = .189). Significantly greater mean reductions in SNOT-16 scores occurred in moxifloxacin- versus placebo-treated patients (-17.54 vs. -12.83; P = .032). Overall concomitant medication use was lower in moxifloxacin versus placebo patients (38.4%, 28/73 vs. 55.6%, 25/45 respectively).

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an effective adjuvant therapy but still not ideal. Intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation (iTBS), which has only been used recently in clinical practice, could have a faster and more intense effect compared to conventional protocols, including 10-Hz high-frequency rTMS (HF-rTMS). However, no controlled study has so far highlighted the superiority of iTBS in resistant unipolar depression.
METHODS/DESIGN: This paper focuses on the design of a randomised, controlled, double-blind, single-centre study with two parallel arms, carried out in France, in an attempt to assess the efficacy of an iTBS protocol versus a standard HF- rTMS protocol. Sixty patients aged between 18 and 75 years of age will be enrolled. They must be diagnosed with major depressive disorder persisting despite treatment with two antidepressants at an effective dose over a period of 6 weeks during the current episode. The study will consist of two phases: a treatment phase comprising 20 sessions of rTMS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, localised via a neuronavigation system and a 6-month longitudinal follow-up. The primary endpoint will be the number of responders per group, defined by a decrease of at least 50% in the initial score on the Montgomery and Asberg Rating Scale (MADRS) at the end of rTMS sessions. The secondary endpoints will be: response rate 1 month after rTMS sessions; number of remissions defined by a MADRS score of <8 at the endpoint and 1 month after; the number of responses and remissions maintained over the next 6 months; quality of life; and the presence of predictive markers of the therapeutic response: clinical (dimensional scales), neuropsychological (evaluation of cognitive functions), motor (objective motor testing) and neurophysiological (cortical excitability measurements).
DISCUSSION: The purpose of our study is to check the assumption of iTBS superiority in the management of unipolar depression and we will discuss its effect over time. In case of a significant increase in the number of therapeutic responses with a prolonged effect, the iTBS protocol could be considered a first-line protocol in resistant unipolar depression.

Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4) inhibitors are glucose-lowering medications with pleiotropic actions that may particularly benefit people with HIV, but the immune and virological safety of DPP4 inhibition in HIV is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: DPP4 inhibition will not reduce CD4+ T lymphocyte number or increase HIV viremia in HIV-positive adults.
DESIGN: This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind safety trial of sitagliptin in HIV-positive adults.
SETTING: The study was conducted at an academic medical center.
PARTICIPANTS: Twenty nondiabetic HIV-positive men and women (9.8 ± 5.5 years of known HIV) taking antiretroviral therapy and with stable immune (625 ± 134 CD4+ T cells per microliter) and virological (<48 copies HIV RNA per milliliter) status.
INTERVENTION: The intervention included sitagliptin (100 mg/d) vs matching placebo for up to 24 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: CD4+ T cell number and plasma HIV RNA were measured every 4 weeks; fasting serum regulated upon activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), stromal derived factor (SDF)-1α, Soluble TNF receptor II, and oral glucose tolerance were measured at baseline, week 8, and the end of study. ANOVA was used for between-group comparisons; P < .05 was considered significant.
RESULTS: Compared with placebo, sitagliptin did not reduce CD4+ T cell count, plasma HIV RNA remained less than 48 copies/mL, RANTES and soluble TNF receptor II concentrations did not increase. SDF1α concentrations declined (P < .0002) in the sitagliptin group. The oral glucose tolerance levels improved in the sitagliptin group at week 8.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite lowering SDF1α levels, sitagliptin did not adversely affect immune or virological status, or increase immune activation, but did improve glycemia in healthy, nondiabetic HIV-positive adults.

DESIGN: A research synthesis of published ART adherence intervention outcome studies.
SAMPLE: ART adherence intervention outcome studies meeting inclusion criteria published between 1996 and December 2004 (k=24).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Effect sizes (ESs [d]) were calculated for each study outcome, producing 25 immediate postintervention outcomes and an additional 13 follow-up ESs. Reported pre- to post-ART adherence between groups (k = 15) or within groups (k = 10) served as the main outcome converted to standardized ES.
RESULTS: ART adherence interventions had a small effect (d = 0.35, odds ratio [OR] = 1.88) that varied considerably across studies. Interventions that specifically enrolled participants with known or anticipated problems with ART adherence demonstrated medium effects on adherence (d = 0.62, OR = 3.07).

METHODS: Data were analyzed for 134 adults 60 years or older with insomnia and apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of less than 15 who were randomized to a larger study of CBTI versus a sleep education control. Sleep outcomes (sleep onset latency, total wake time, wake after sleep onset, sleep efficiency, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) were compared between CBTI and control at 6 months using repeated-measures analysis of variance adjusted for baseline values. AHI of 5 or greater versus less than 5 was included as an interaction term to evaluate changes in sleep outcomes. The number of participants at baseline and 6 months with mild SDB for whom insomnia was their only other indication for PAP was also compared between CBTI and control.
RESULTS: AHI status (AHI ≥ 5 [75.5% of participants] versus AHI < 5) did not moderate improvements in sleep associated with CBTI (all p values ≥ .12). Nine (45.0%) of 20 participants with mild SDB for whom insomnia was their only other indication for PAP therapy at baseline no longer had another indication for PAP at 6 months, with no significant difference between CBTI and control.

It also lowers heart rate and blood pressure and has antiadrenergic and potential ventricular antiarrhythmic effects. We hypothesized that dronedarone would reduce major vascular events in high-risk permanent atrial fibrillation.
METHODS: We assigned patients who were at least 65 years of age with at least a 6-month history of permanent atrial fibrillation and risk factors for major vascular events to receive dronedarone or placebo. The first coprimary outcome was stroke, myocardial infarction, systemic embolism, or death from cardiovascular causes. The second coprimary outcome was unplanned hospitalization for a cardiovascular cause or death.
RESULTS: After the enrollment of 3236 patients, the study was stopped for safety reasons. The first coprimary outcome occurred in 43 patients receiving dronedarone and 19 receiving placebo (hazard ratio, 2.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.34 to 3.94; P=0.002). There were 21 deaths from cardiovascular causes in the dronedarone group and 10 in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.00 to 4.49; P=0.046), including death from arrhythmia in 13 patients and 4 patients, respectively (hazard ratio, 3.26; 95% CI, 1.06 to 10.00; P=0.03).

METHODS: This multicenter, double-blind randomized controlled trial compared the efficacy and safety of SARS-CoV-2 high titer convalescent plasma to placebo control plasma in symptomatic adults ≥18 years positive for SARS-CoV-2 regardless of risk factors for disease progression or vaccine status. Participants with symptom onset within 8 days were enrolled, then transfused within the subsequent day. The measured primary outcome was COVID-19-related hospitalization within 28 days of plasma transfusion. The enrollment period was June 3, 2020 to October 1, 2021.
RESULTS: A total of 1225 participants were randomized and 1181 transfused. In the pre-specified modified intention-to-treat analysis that excluded those not transfused, the primary endpoint occurred in 37 of 589 (6.3%) who received placebo control plasma and in 17 of 592 (2.9%) participants who received convalescent plasma (relative risk, 0.46; one-sided 95% upper bound confidence interval 0.733; P=0.004) corresponding to a 54% risk reduction. Examination with a model adjusting for covariates related to the outcome did not change the conclusions.
CONCLUSION: Early administration of high titer SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma reduced outpatient hospitalizations by more than 50%. High titer convalescent plasma is an effective early outpatient COVID-19 treatment with the advantages of low cost, wide availability, and rapid resilience to variant emergence from viral genetic drift in the face of a changing pandemic.

Cost equations and sample calculations of total and expected costs per client in a specified time period are provided. This method of estimating costs provides a systematic application of a standard set of procedures, including sample tables and calculations. It uses the societal perspective on resource cost to determine true resource costs. This method can be used for resource allocation decisions among programs and as inputs for cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analyses. Since the method minimizes the burden of data collection and calculations, it is useful for the nonspecialist in cost analysis. The method provides a rational approach for realistic decision making and planning in public health.",2,PRIMARY,Continuous Adherence,Percentage of doses taken of those prescribed from electronic monitoring.

We examined whether one reason for this disparity is that women are less likely to use HAART when they have difficulty taking HIV medications openly at home.
METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study of a national probability sample of 2864 adults receiving HIV care.
RESULTS: Among the 1910 people who participated in the follow-up survey and reported taking HIV medications, 11.8% reported they could not take HIV medications openly at home. Those who reported they had difficulty taking medications openly at home were more likely to be women, to be black, to live in the northeast United States, to have an annual income <5,000 US dollars, and to have no health insurance. In bivariate analysis, women had twice the odds of reporting difficulty taking medications openly (odds ratio [OR] 2.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.36-3.15) compared with gay/bisexual men, although this gender difference was no longer significant in the adjusted model. For women, having difficulty taking medications openly at home was associated with a substantial decrease in the probability of being on HAART in the adjusted model (0.59, 95% CI 0.47-0.70 vs. 0.78, 95% CI 0.74-0.83), whereas no significant differences were observed for heterosexual or gay/bisexual men.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a 56-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which 505 patients received standardized lifestyle intervention and were randomized 2:1 to NB or placebo. Coprimary end points were percent weight change and achievement of ≥5% weight loss. Secondary end points included achievement of HbA1c <7% (53 mmol/mol), achievement of weight loss ≥10%, and change in HbA1c, waist circumference, fasting blood glucose, and lipids.

Particle size distributions and the respirable fraction (RF) were evaluated by laser diffraction technique. Regression analysis of the change in rate of output and change in RF values with inspiratory flows was done to characterize each nebulizer's performance over the complete range of interest.

We aimed to assess whether bihormonal bionic pancreas initialised only with body mass can safely reduce mean glycaemia and hypoglycaemia in adults with type 1 diabetes who were living at home and participating in their normal daily routines without restrictions on diet or physical activity.
METHODS: We did a random-order crossover study in volunteers at least 18 years old who had type 1 diabetes and lived within a 30 min drive of four sites in the USA. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) in blocks of two using sequentially numbered sealed envelopes to glycaemic regulation with a bihormonal bionic pancreas or usual care (conventional or sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy) first, followed by the opposite intervention. Both study periods were 11 days in length, during which time participants continued all normal activities, including athletics and driving. The bionic pancreas was initialised with only the participant's body mass. Autonomously adaptive dosing algorithms used data from a continuous glucose monitor to control subcutaneous delivery of insulin and glucagon. The coprimary outcomes were the mean glucose concentration and time with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) glucose concentration less than 3·3 mmol/L, analysed over days 2-11 in participants who completed both periods of the study. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02092220.
FINDINGS: We randomly assigned 43 participants between May 6, 2014, and July 3, 2015, 39 of whom completed the study: 20 who were assigned to bionic pancreas first and 19 who were assigned to the comparator first. The mean CGM glucose concentration was 7·8 mmol/L (SD 0·6) in the bionic pancreas period versus 9·0 mmol/L (1·6) in the comparator period (difference 1·1 mmol/L, 95% CI 0·7-1·6; p<0·0001), and the mean time with CGM glucose concentration less than 3·3 mmol/L was 0·6% (0·6) in the bionic pancreas period versus 1·9% (1·7) in the comparator period (difference 1·3%, 95% CI 0·8-1·8; p<0·0001). The mean nausea score on the Visual Analogue Scale (score 0-10) was greater during the bionic pancreas period (0·52 [SD 0·83]) than in the comparator period (0·05 [0·17]; difference 0·47, 95% CI 0·21-0·73; p=0·0024). Body mass and laboratory parameters did not differ between periods. There were no serious or unexpected adverse events in the bionic pancreas period of the study.
INTERPRETATION: Relative to conventional and sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy, the bihormonal bionic pancreas, initialised only with participant weight, was able to achieve superior glycaemic regulation without the need for carbohydrate counting. Larger and longer studies are needed to establish the long-term benefits and risks of automated glycaemic management with a bihormonal bionic pancreas.

Patient motivations for sharing access included: to help manage care (41.9%), for emergency reasons (29.7%), lack of technology experience (18.4%), or care partner request (10.0%). Care partners were parents (39.8%), adult children (27.9%), spouses (26.2%), and other relatives (6.1%). Patients were more likely than care partners to have inadequate health literacy (54.8% versus 8.8%, P < .001) and less confident in their ability to manage their care (53.0% versus 88.1%; P < .001). Care partners were more likely than patients to perform health management activities electronically (95.5% versus 48.4%; P < .001), access the patient portal (89.2% versus 30.3%; P < .001), and use patient portal functionality such as secure messaging (39.6% versus 13.9%; P < .001). Care partners used their own credentials (89.1%) and patient credentials (23.3%) to access the patient portal.

Thiazides act on the nephron segment distal to the ascending thick loop of Henle, that is, the site of action of loop diuretics. Blockade of sodium reabsorption in the thiazide-sensitive segment should therefore obliterate the compensatory increase in sodium reabsorption seen after administration of loop diuretics and thus potentiate the natriuretic efficacy of loop diuretics even in advanced renal failure. In a single-blind, randomized, placebo controlled crossover study we compared the natriuretic and chloruretic effect of the loop diuretic, torasemide, given alone or in combination with the thiazide diuretic, butizid, in 10 patients with advanced renal failure (mean CIn 13.1 +/- 5.9 ml/min/1.73 m2).

METHODS: We extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.
RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female. The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died. Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife. Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city. The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%). Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%). The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%). No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease. Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.

However, opioids could be prescribed at physician discretion by overriding the EHR. This study aims to examine protocol compliance in a large group practice using EHR order sets and complication rates as compared with historical data.
STUDY DESIGN: Case series with chart review.
SETTING: Ambulatory care within a health maintenance organization.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Procedural codes were used to identify children <7 years old who underwent tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy approximately 1.5 years before and after implementation of EHR protocol (n = 437). Primary outcome was opioid pain prescriptions received by patients. Secondary outcomes were emergency or urgent care utilization, postoperative bleeding, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, death, and reasons for prescribing opioid pain medication after EHR protocol implementation. Chi-square analysis and Fischer's exact testing were used to compare differences in event rates.
RESULTS: Implementation of an age-based narcotic protocol significantly decreased physician narcotic prescribing from 82.2% to 15.4% (P < .0001). The most common reason for narcotic prescription after the intervention was the report of inadequate pain control by phone call (35%). There was no significant difference in rate of emergency or urgent care utilization between pre- and postimplementation groups (4% vs 6%, P = .29).
CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of an age-based narcotic restriction for posttonsillectomy patients using an EHR order set is an effective and safe way to influence physician prescription practices.",2,PRIMARY,Average Pain Burden,Average pain over 14 post-operative days before and after medications.

To be fully active, immune T cells need a co-stimulatory signal in addition to the main antigen-driven signal. Abatacept modulates co-stimulation and prevents full T-cell activation. We evaluated the effect of abatacept in recent-onset type 1 diabetes.
METHODS: In this multicentre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial, patients aged 6-45 years recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive abatacept (10 mg/kg, maximum 1000 mg per dose) or placebo infusions intravenously on days 1, 14, 28, and monthly for a total of 27 infusions over 2 years. Computer-generated permuted block randomisation was used, with a block size of 3 and stratified by participating site. Neither patients nor research personnel were aware of treatment assignments. The primary outcome was baseline-adjusted geometric mean 2-h area-under-the-curve (AUC) serum C-peptide concentration after a mixed-meal tolerance test at 2 years' follow-up. Analysis was by intention to treat for all patients for whom data were available. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00505375.
FINDINGS: 112 patients were assigned to treatment groups (77 abatacept, 35 placebo). Adjusted C-peptide AUC was 59% (95% CI 6·1-112) higher at 2 years with abatacept (n=73, 0·378 nmol/L) than with placebo (n=30, 0·238 nmol/L; p=0·0029). The difference between groups was present throughout the trial, with an estimated 9·6 months' delay (95% CI 3·47-15·6) in C-peptide reduction with abatacept. There were few infusion-related adverse events (36 reactions occurred in 17 [22%] patients on abatacept and 11 reactions in six [17%] on placebo). There was no increase in infections (32 [42%] patients on abatacept vs 15 [43%] on placebo) or neutropenia (seven [9%] vs five [14%]).
INTERPRETATION: Co-stimulation modulation with abatacept slowed reduction in β-cell function over 2 years. The beneficial effect suggests that T-cell activation still occurs around the time of clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. Yet, despite continued administration of abatacept over 24 months, the decrease in β-cell function with abatacept was parallel to that with placebo after 6 months of treatment, causing us to speculate that T-cell activation lessens with time. Further observation will establish whether the beneficial effect continues after cessation of abatacept infusions.

Over the past decade the scientific and medical community has had the opportunity to evaluate the safety record of research studies and clinical applications of TMS and repetitive TMS (rTMS). In these years the number of applications of conventional TMS has grown impressively, new paradigms of stimulation have been developed (e.g., patterned repetitive TMS) and technical advances have led to new device designs and to the real-time integration of TMS with electroencephalography (EEG), positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Thousands of healthy subjects and patients with various neurological and psychiatric diseases have undergone TMS allowing a better assessment of relative risks. The occurrence of seizures (i.e., the most serious TMS-related acute adverse effect) has been extremely rare, with most of the few new cases receiving rTMS exceeding previous guidelines, often in patients under treatment with drugs which potentially lower the seizure threshold. The present updated guidelines review issues of risk and safety of conventional TMS protocols, address the undesired effects and risks of emerging TMS interventions, the applications of TMS in patients with implanted electrodes in the central nervous system, and safety aspects of TMS in neuroimaging environments. We cover recommended limits of stimulation parameters and other important precautions, monitoring of subjects, expertise of the rTMS team, and ethical issues.

METHODS: We randomly assigned patients with epidermal growth factor receptor-positive colorectal cancer with unresectable metastases to receive FOLFIRI either alone or in combination with cetuximab. The primary end point was progression-free survival.
RESULTS: A total of 599 patients received cetuximab plus FOLFIRI, and 599 received FOLFIRI alone. The hazard ratio for progression-free survival in the cetuximab-FOLFIRI group as compared with the FOLFIRI group was 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72 to 0.99; P=0.048).

We did a multicentre randomised controlled trial to test the hypothesis that intrapartum monitoring with cardiotocography combined with automatic ST-waveform analysis results in an improved perinatal outcome compared with cardiotocography alone.
METHODS: At three Swedish labour wards, 4966 women with term fetuses in the cephalic presentation entered the trial during labour after a clinical decision had been made to apply a fetal scalp electrode for internal cardiotocography. They were randomly assigned monitoring with cardiotocography plus ST analysis (CTG+ST group) or cardiotocography only (CTG group). The main outcome measure was rate of umbilical-artery metabolic acidosis (pH <7.05 and base deficit >12 mmol/L). Secondary outcomes included operative delivery for fetal distress. Results were first analysed according to intention to treat, and secondly after exclusion of cases with severe malformations or with inadequate monitoring.
FINDINGS: The CTG+ST group showed significantly lower rates of umbilical-artery metabolic acidosis than the cardiotocography group (15 of 2159 [0.7%] vs 31 of 2079 [2%], relative risk 0.47 [95% CI 0.25-0.86], p=0.02) and of operative delivery for fetal distress (193 of 2519 [8%] vs 227 of 2447 [9%], 0.83 [0.69-0.99], p=0.047) when all cases were included according to intention to treat. The differences were more pronounced after exclusion of 291 in the CTG+ST group and 283 in the CTG group with malformations or inadequate recording.

Outcomes included progression of disease and death, HIV viral suppression, and change in CD4(+) cell count. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for known predictors of survival. There were 1357 subjects, including 368 non-Latino white, 751 non-Latino African American, and 238 Latino subjects. At baseline, the two latter groups were more likely to have had AIDS and had lower CD4(+) cell counts than white subjects.

Gaseous nitric oxide has been demonstrated to have a myocardial protective effect following ischemia-reperfusion. We hypothesized that gaseous nitric oxide administered during cardiopulmonary bypass would have similar beneficial effects.
METHODS: In a prospective, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study, children undergoing repair of tetralogy of Fallot received either 20 ppm of gaseous nitric oxide or placebo delivered to the membrane oxygenator during cardiopulmonary bypass.
RESULTS: A total of 16 children were randomized into 2 equal groups once their parents or guardians had given written informed consent. No differences were found in age, crossclamp time, cardiopulmonary bypass time, or methemoglobin between the 2 groups. The group receiving gaseous nitric oxide had a significantly shortened duration of mechanical ventilation (8.4 ± 7.6 vs 16.3 ± 6.5 hours; P < .05) and intensive care unit length of stay (53.8 ± 19.7 vs 79.4 ± 37.7 hours; P < .05) compared with the placebo group.

Autologous blood retransfusion is not devoid of risk. We hypothesized that adding tranexamic acid (TXA) to a restrictive blood transfusion protocol would reduce the need for postoperative autologous blood retransfusion in primary knee and hip arthroplasty.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Ninety-eight adult patients undergoing primary THA or TKA were randomly assigned to receive an intraoperative intravenous loading dose of 1.0 g of TXA followed by another 1.0-g dose 3 hours later (TXA group) or a matching volume 0.9% saline placebo (control group). A postoperatively shed autologous blood recovery system was used in all patients and the minimum reinfusion volume set at 250 mL. Red blood cells were transfused if hemoglobin level was less than 8 or if 8 to 10 g/dL with symptoms of anemia.
RESULTS: The proportion of patients receiving autologous blood reinfusion was significantly lower in the TXA group (5/49) compared to placebo (42/49) with an absolute difference of -75.5% (adjusted relative risk, 0.005), and none of the patients in the TXA group received more than 400 mL retransfused. Median total external blood loss during the first 24 hours was lower in the TXA group, 320 mL (range, 80-930 mL), compared to 970 mL (range, 100-2600 mL) in the placebo group (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in homologous blood transfusions and hematologic variables between groups.

An injection of autologous blood might provide the necessary cellular and humoral mediators to induce a healing cascade. The purpose of this study was to evaluate prospectively the results of refractory lateral epicondylitis treated with autologous blood injections.
METHOD: Twenty-eight patients with lateral epicondylitis were injected with 2 mL of autologous blood under the extensor carpi radialis brevis. All patients had failed previous nonsurgical treatments including all or combinations of physical therapy, splinting, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication, and prior steroid injections. Patients kept personal logs and rated their pain (0-10) and categorized themselves according to Nirschl staging (0-7) daily.
RESULTS: The average follow-up period was 9.5 months (range, 6-24 mo). After autologous blood injections the average pain score decreased from 7.8 to 2.3. The average Nirschl stage decreased from 6.5 to 2.0. For the 9 patients receiving more than one blood injection the mean pain score and Nirschl stage before injection were 7.2 and 6.6, respectively. After the second blood injection the pain and Nirschl scores were both 0.9. Two patients received a third blood injection that brought both pain and Nirschl scores to 0.

In this paper, we present results from an analysis of existing data about the demographic and clinical characteristics, service needs and utilization patterns, and primary care retention of HIV-positive primary care patients seen at FCHC during a 24-month study period. Patient data were extracted from Logician, FCHC's electronic medical record system, and imported into Microsoft Access, Microsoft Excel and SAS for manipulation and analysis. A total of 999 unique individuals were included in the study population. Most were men (97%), white (75%) and between 39 and 80 years of age. Patients averaged 6.7 medical visits annually at FCHC, and 61% had at least one medical visit every six months. Significant predictors of primary care utilization were insurance status, HIV disease stage, being on combination therapy, first CD4 count, first viral load level and receipt of ancillary services. Need and receipt of ancillary services were found through medical and case management record review; case management was the most used ancillary service, received by 36% of the study population. For most ancillary services, clients with assessed need had documented receipt of the service. Publicly insured and/or Ryan White CARE Act-funded patients had the greatest ancillary service utilization. The influence of ancillary services upon primary care entry could not be evaluated with available data; however, their influence upon primary care was significant. For patients who received primary care in every continuous six-month period, statistically significant associations were found with receipt of mental health care, case management, drug assistance, food/nutrition, complementary services and housing.

Lesion and stimulation studies suggest involvement of the amygdala in the generation of the skin conductance response (SCR), which is an indirect measure of autonomic activity that has been associated with both emotion and attention. It is unclear if this involvement marks an emotional reaction to an external stimulus or sympathetic arousal regardless of its origin. We recorded skin conductance in parallel with single-unit activity from the right amygdala of two rhesus monkeys during a rewarded image viewing task and while the monkeys sat alone in a dimly lit room, drifting in and out of sleep. In both experimental conditions, we found similar SCR-related modulation of activity at the single-unit and neural population level.

Nevertheless, significant safety and efficacy deficits continue to exist. Severe idiosyncratic reactions and organ toxicity have hampered the wide use of some of the newer AEDs. As a decade before, about one third of patients with chronic epilepsy is resistant to current pharmacotherapy.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of case managers on unmet need for supportive services and utilization of medical care and medications among HIV-infected persons.
DESIGN: Baseline and follow-up interview of a national probability sample.
SETTING: Inpatient and outpatient medical facilities in the United States.
PARTICIPANTS: 2437 HIV-infected adults representing 217 081 patients receiving medical care.
MEASUREMENTS: Outcomes measured at follow-up were unmet need for supportive services, medical care utilization (ambulatory visits, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations), and use of HIV medication (receipt of antiretroviral therapy and prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and toxoplasmosis).
RESULTS: At baseline, 56.5% of the sample had contact with a case manager in the previous 6 months. In multiple logistic regression analyses that adjusted for potential confounders, contact with a case manager at baseline was associated with decreased unmet need for income assistance (odds ratio [OR], 0.57 [95% CI, 0.36 to 0.91]), health insurance (OR, 0.54 [CI, 0.33 to 0.89]), home health care (OR, 0.29 [CI, 0.15 to 0.56]), and emotional counseling (OR, 0.62 [CI, 0.41 to 0.94]) at follow-up.

The aims of the study were to investigate whether beta-adrenoceptor stimulation and hypoxia exerted additive or potentiating effects on the FECG and several cardiovascular parameters and whether the hypoxic changes of the FECG could be blocked by beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents. The FECG changes were studied in order to correlate them with cardiovascular function, as measured by heart rate, mean arterial pressure, end diastolic pressure, maximum dP/dt and combined cardiac output, estimated by the thermodilution method, as well as with blood gases, acid base status, blood lactate and glucose. Injections of small doses (0.02 to 0.4 microg kg-1 min-1) of isoprenaline induced the same pattern of changes in the FECG as we have previously recorded during hypoxia. By increasing the isoprenaline dose an increase in the duration of the FECG changes and amplitude of the T-wave changes was obtained. Propranolol was found to completely abolish the FECG changes induced by isoprenaline, as well as by mild hypoxia. During severe hypoxia the FECG changes could not be abolished by propranolol.

Several studies have shown that regular physical exercise is significantly beneficial for psychiatric patients both on a biological and a psychological level. Positive effects of controlled exercise include improved metabolic responses, neuro-protection, increased quality of life, and reduced psychopathological symptoms. Studies investigating the effectiveness of various physical training interventions in alleviating severe mental diseases, such as Alzheimer's dementia (AD), schizophrenia (SZ) or major depressive disorder (MDD) indicate that physical exercise can relieve symptoms of depression, psychosis and dementia and more importantly can curtail further progression of these diseases. This review assesses the most effective methods of physical training for specific psychiatric symptoms. Introducing physical exercise in therapeutic regimes would be an innovative approach that could significantly reduce the severity of psychopathological and cognitive symptoms in patients. The positive biological and molecular outcomes associated with physical exercise render it a concrete therapeutic strategy for improving the quality of live and reducing physical illness in psychiatric patients. Therefore, integrating physical activity into a patient's social life may be an effective treatment strategy.

DESIGN: A randomized, controlled trial comparing CCMP with guideline-based usual care. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00395083) SETTING: 20 Veterans Affairs hospital-based outpatient clinics.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients hospitalized for COPD in the past year.
INTERVENTION: The CCMP included COPD education during 4 individual sessions and 1 group session, an action plan for identification and treatment of exacerbations, and scheduled proactive telephone calls for case management. Patients in both the intervention and usual care groups received a COPD informational booklet; their primary care providers received a copy of COPD guidelines and were advised to manage their patients according to these guidelines. Patients were randomly assigned, stratifying by site based on random, permuted blocks of variable size.
MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was time to first COPD hospitalization. Staff blinded to study group performed telephone-based assessment of COPD exacerbations and hospitalizations, and all hospitalizations were blindly adjudicated. Secondary outcomes included non-COPD health care use, all-cause mortality, health-related quality of life, patient satisfaction, disease knowledge, and self-efficacy.
RESULTS: Of the eligible patients, 209 were randomly assigned to the intervention group and 217 to the usual care group. Citing serious safety concerns, the data monitoring committee terminated the intervention before the trial's planned completion after 426 (44%) of the planned total of 960 patients were enrolled. Mean follow-up was 250 days. When the study was stopped, the 1-year cumulative incidence of COPD-related hospitalization was 27% in the intervention group and 24% in the usual care group (hazard ratio, 1.13 [95% CI, 0.70 to 1.80]; P= 0.62). There were 28 deaths from all causes in the intervention group versus 10 in the usual care group (hazard ratio, 3.00 [CI, 1.46 to 6.17]; P= 0.003). Cause could be assigned in 27 (71%) deaths. Deaths due to COPD accounted for the largest difference: 10 in the intervention group versus 3 in the usual care group (hazard ratio, 3.60 [CI, 0.99 to 13.08]; P= 0.053).
LIMITATIONS: Available data could not fully explain the excess mortality in the intervention group. Ability to assess the quality of the educational sessions provided by the case managers was limited.

Although the applicability of this regimen to humans remains uncertain, a proportional response would add more healthy years to the average life than even a cure for cancer or heart disease. Because it is unlikely that many would be willing or able to maintain a DR lifestyle, there has been intense interest in mimicking its beneficial effects on health, and potentially longevity, with drugs. To date, such efforts have been hindered primarily by our lack of mechanistic understanding of how DR works. Sirtuins, NAD(+)-dependent deacetylases and ADP-ribosyltransferases that influence lifespan in lower organisms, have been proposed to be key mediators of DR, and based on this model, the sirtuin activator resveratrol has been proposed as a candidate DR mimetic. Indeed, resveratrol extends lifespan in yeast, worms, flies, and a short-lived species of fish. In rodents, resveratrol improves health, and prevents the early mortality associated with obesity, but its precise mechanism of action remains a subject of debate, and extension of normal lifespan has not been observed.

METHOD: Patients who were HIV+ and had clinically significant fatigue (according to the Fatigue Severity Scale [FSS]) were included in a 4-week randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. This was followed by an additional 8 weeks of open-label treatment for modafinil responders and 12 weeks for placebo nonresponders. The primary outcome measure for fatigue and depression was the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale, supplemented by the FSS, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and Beck Depression Inventory. Safety was assessed with assays of CD4 cell count and HIV ribonucleic acid (RNA) viral load. Visits were weekly for 4 weeks, then biweekly, with a follow-up visit at 6 months. Maximum trial dose of modafinil was 200 mg/d. Data for this study were collected between December 2004 and December 2008.
RESULTS: 115 patients were randomly assigned. In intention-to-treat analyses, fatigue response rate to modafinil was 73% and to placebo, 28%. Attrition was 9%. Modafinil did not have an effect on mood alone in the absence of improved energy. At week 4, CD4 cell counts did not change significantly; HIV RNA viral load showed a trend decline for patients taking modafinil but not for those taking placebo. At 6 months, those still taking modafinil had more energy and fewer depressive symptoms than patients who were not taking modafinil, and only those still taking modafinil showed a significant decline from baseline in their HIV RNA viral load.
CONCLUSIONS: Modafinil appears to be effective and well tolerated in treating fatigue in HIV+ patients. Consideration of its use is warranted considering the high prevalence of fatigue in the HIV community, its minimal side effects, and overall patient acceptance.

Week 12,20491649,"The Cardiovascular Nutrapharmacology of Resveratrol: Pharmacokinetics, Molecular Mechanisms and Therapeutic Potential.","Red wine contains many compounds that may have therapeutic use, including resveratrol (3,4',5-trihydroxytrans-stilbene). Since resveratrol could be administered both in the diet and as a therapeutic agent, defining appropriate concentrations requires understanding of the pharmacokinetics. Resveratrol absorption is rapid but plasma concentrations are low as it is rapidly and efficiently converted into relatively hydrophilic phase-2 conjugates, and metabolites, which are then rapidly excreted via the urine and bile. Resveratrol is an effective antioxidant in vivo by increasing NO synthesis and also maintaining the reduced intracellular redox state via the thioredoxin system. Further, activation of sirtuins (one class of lysine deacetylases) may mediate the cardiovascular responses shown by resveratrol. Studies on animal models of human disease suggest that resveratrol has the potential to decrease cardiovascular symptoms in patients with myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, hypertension, cardiomyopathies, fibrosis, atherosclerosis, thrombosis and diabetes, but, as yet, human clinical trials are rare. Cardioprotection by resveratrol in rodent models may rely on mechanisms producing pharmacological preconditioning in the heart including reducing reactive oxygen species, improving vasorelaxation and angiogenesis, preventing inflammation and apoptosis, delaying atherosclerosis as well as decreasing cardiovascular remodelling. Interventional studies in humans need to be completed before resveratrol can be considered as a standard therapeutic agent. Therefore, future studies should focus on obtaining the level of evidence required to determine whether resveratrol can be added to the list of evidence-based therapies for cardiovascular diseases that includes renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and calcium entry blockers.",2,PRIMARY,Total Insulin Sensitivity at Week 12.,The insulin sensitivity was calculated at baseline and week 12 with Matsuda index and the entered values reflect the insulin sensitivity at week 12,Resveratrol,Placebo,"Resveratrol capsules, 500 mg, three times per day before meals during 90 days

METHODS: In this multicenter trial, we randomly assigned 131 patients who had one to three painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures to undergo either vertebroplasty or a simulated procedure without cement (control group). The primary outcomes were scores on the modified Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ) (on a scale of 0 to 23, with higher scores indicating greater disability) and patients' ratings of average pain intensity during the preceding 24 hours at 1 month (on a scale of 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more severe pain). Patients were allowed to cross over to the other study group after 1 month.
RESULTS: All patients underwent the assigned intervention (68 vertebroplasties and 63 simulated procedures). The baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. At 1 month, there was no significant difference between the vertebroplasty group and the control group in either the RDQ score (difference, 0.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], -1.3 to 2.8; P=0.49) or the pain rating (difference, 0.7; 95% CI, -0.3 to 1.7; P=0.19).

This study investigated whether cigarette demand predicted response to contingent monetary rewards for abstinence among individuals with substance use disorders. It also sought to replicate evidence for greater price sensitivity at whole-dollar pack price transitions (ie, left-digit effects).
METHODS: Participants (N = 338) were individuals in residential substance use disorder treatment who participated in a randomized controlled trial that compared contingent vouchers to noncontingent vouchers for smoking abstinence. Baseline demand indices were used to predict number of abstinent days during the 14-day voucher period (after the reduction lead-in) and at 1 and 3 months afterward.
RESULTS: Demand indices correlated with measures of smoking and nicotine dependence. As measured by elasticity, intensity and O max, higher demand significantly predicted fewer abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings during voucher period for individuals in the noncontingent vouchers condition. Breakpoint exhibited a trend-level association with abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings. Demand indices did not predict abstinence in the contingent vouchers group, and did not predict abstinence at 1- and 3-month follow-ups. Left-digit price transitions were associated with significantly greater reductions in consumption.
CONCLUSIONS: The association of cigarette demand with smoking behavior only in the group for whom abstinence was not incentivized indicates that CPT assesses the value of smoking more than the value of money per se and that vouchers counteract the effects of the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes. Results provide initial short-term evidence of predictive validity for the CPT indices.
IMPLICATIONS: This study provides the first evidence of the validity of the CPT for predicting early response to brief advice for smoking cessation plus nicotine replacement in smokers with substance dependence. However, demand for cigarettes did not predict voucher-based treatment response, indicating that incentives serve as a powerful motivator not to smoke that acts in opposition to the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes and that the indices reflect the value of smoking more than the value of money per se.",0,PRIMARY,Percent Smoking Days,No Description Available,Contingency Management (CM),Noncontingent Reinforcement (NR),"Condition provides contingent monetary reinforcement for smoking reductions (first 5 days) then for smoking abstinence (subsequent 14 days).

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to synthesize the qualitative results of research regarding Latina food patterns in order to (a) identify common patterns across Latino culture and within Latino subcultures and (b) inform future research by determining gaps in the literature.
METHODS: A systematic search of three databases produced 13 studies (15 manuscripts) that met the inclusion criteria for review. The Critical Appraisal Skills Program tool and the recommendations of Squires for evaluating translation methods in qualitative research were applied to appraise study quality. Authors coded through directed content analysis and an adaptation of the Joanna Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument coding template to extract themes. Coding focused on food patterns, obesity, population breakdown, immigration, acculturation, and barriers and facilitators to healthy eating. Other themes and categories emerged from this process to complement this approach.
RESULTS: Major findings included the following: (a) Immigration driven changes in scheduling, food choice, socioeconomic status, and family dynamics shape the complex psychology behind healthy food choices for Latina women; (b) in Latina populations, barriers and facilitators to healthy lifestyle choices around food are complex; and (c) there is a clear need to differentiate Latino populations by country of origin in future qualitative studies on eating behavior.

BACKGROUND: Influenza is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular events in patients with heart failure.
METHODS: We used data from the PARADIGM-HF trial in which patients with heart failure were randomized to the angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor LCZ696 (sacubitril/valsartan) or enalapril. We assessed predictors of receiving influenza vaccination, and examined the relationship between influenza vaccination and outcomes in a propensity-adjusted model.
RESULTS: Of 8,099 study participants, 1,769 (21%) received influenza vaccination. We observed significant regional variation in vaccination rates, with highest rates in the Netherlands (77.5%), Great Britain (77.2%), and Belgium (67.5%), and lowest rates in Asia (2.6%), with intermediate rates in North America (52.8%). Top predictors of vaccination included enrolling country, white race, implanted defibrillator, older age, lower New York Heart Association functional class, lower heart rate, and a history of diabetes mellitus.

We assessed the impact of immediate vs as-needed oral etoposide (ET) among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals with mild-to-moderate KS initiating ART.
METHODS: Chemotherapy-naive, HIV type 1-infected adults with mild-to-moderate KS initiating ART in Africa and South America were randomized to ART (tenofovir/emtricitabine/efavirenz) alone (chemotherapy ""as-needed"" arm) vs ART plus up to 8 cycles of oral ET (immediate arm). Participants with KS progression on ART alone received ET as part of the as-needed strategy. Primary outcome was ordinal as follows: failure, stable, and response at 48 weeks. Secondary outcomes included time to initial KS progression, KS-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (KS-IRIS), and KS response.
RESULTS: Of 190 randomized participants (as-needed = 94, immediate = 96), the majority were men (71%) and African (93%). Failure (53.8% vs 56.6%), stable (16.3% vs 10.8%), and response (30% vs 32.5%) did not differ between arms (as-needed vs immediate) among those with week 48 data potential (N = 163, P = .91). Time to KS progression (P = .021), KS-IRIS (P = .003), and KS response (P = .003) favored the immediate arm. Twenty-five participants died (13%). Mortality, adverse events, CD4+ T-cell changes, and HIV RNA suppression were similar at 48 weeks.
CONCLUSIONS: Among HIV-infected adults with mild-to-moderate KS, immediate ET provided early, nondurable clinical benefits. By 48 weeks, no clinical benefit was observed compared to use of ET as needed. Mortality was high and tumor response was low.

Patient navigation (PN) may address many underlying barriers to CRCS, yet little is known about the effectiveness of PN to increase CRCS adherence among Latino Medicare enrollees.
METHODS: Using a randomized controlled trial study design, we evaluated tailored PN delivered outside of primary care settings as an intervention to increase CRCS adherence in this population. Intervention participants (n = 135) received tailored PN services which included education, counseling, and logistical support administered in their language of choice. Comparison participants (n = 168) received mailed cancer education materials. We compared CRCS rates between interventions and used multivariable logistic regression to assess the odds of CRCS adherence for PN versus comparison groups after adjusting for covariates of interest.
RESULTS: More navigated than non-navigated participants became CRCS adherent during the study period (43.7 vs. 32.1%, p = 0.04). The odds of CRCS adherence were significantly higher for PN relative to comparison participants before and after adjusting for covariates (unadjusted OR 1.64, p = 0.04; adjusted OR 1.82, p = 0.02). Higher CRCS adherence rates were observed primarily in the uptake of endoscopic screening methods.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that PN delivered outside of the primary care environment is modestly effective in increasing CRCS adherence among Latino Medicare enrollees.

Cysteamine and its related drugs are currently being evaluated for the treatment of Huntington's and Parkinson's disease. The aim of te study was to understand the pharmacokinetics of cysteamine bitartrate following gastrointestinal infusion.
METHOD: Cysteamine bitartrate was delivered through a naso-enteric catheter into the stomach (n = 8), small intestine (n = 8) and caecum (n = 4) of normal subjects. Plasma cysteamine concentrations were determined using LC-MS/MS.
RESULTS: The rate and extent of drug absorption were assessed by comparing AUC(0, infinity), C(max) and t(max), among the gastrointestinal infusion sites. Total cysteamine exposure, expressed as area under the curve (AUC(0, infinity)) was greatest when the drug was infused into the small intestine (4331.3 +/- 1907.6 min x microM) followed by stomach (3901.9 +/- 1591.9 min x microM) and caecum (3141.4 +/- 1627.6 min x microM).

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The children with CF consumed more calories per day (2175 cal/d) than the control children (1875 cal/d) and achieved a significantly higher recommended daily allowance (RDA) of energy (128% of the RDA) than the control children (91.61% of the RDA). Fifty-four percent of the CF sample were achieving the CF dietary recommendations of 120% of the RDA. Despite this energy intake, the CF sample was significantly below the control sample on weight (24.56 vs 31.23 kg), height (125.48 vs 133.06 cm), and z score for weight (-0.811 vs 0.528) and height (-0.797 vs 0.371). On measures of behavioral eating style, the CF sample had significantly longer meals (23.90 min) than the control sample (17.34 min) and had a significantly slower pace of eating (43.27% 10-second intervals with bites) than the control sample (51.29% 10-second intervals with bites) but did not differ significantly on the number of calories consumed during dinner. On a measure of parent report of mealtime behaviors, parents of the children with CF rated mealtime behavior problems of ""dawdles"" and ""refuses food"" as more intense (mean, 3. 46) than did the parents of control children (mean, 2.67). For the CF sample, a significant correlation was found between the parent intensity ratings of problem behavior in general and meal duration (r = .48), and a significant negative correlation was found between the parent intensity ratings of problem mealtime behaviors and the percentage of intervals with bites (pace of meal) (r = -.533).
CONCLUSIONS: Although the school-age children with CF were consuming more calories per day than their healthy peers, and more than 50% of the children in the CF sample were at or above the CF dietary recommendations, the children in the CF sample were significantly below the control children on measures of weight and height. The behavioral data suggest that increased caloric intake is not without cost, because the CF sample spent an additional 7 minutes per day at dinner and ate their meals at a slower pace than their healthy peers. These data were associated with higher intensity ratings of mealtime behaviors by parents of children with CF. These findings point to the need for individualized assessment of energy needs for school-age children with CF and comprehensive programs that teach parents behavioral strategies to motivate their children to meet these higher energy requirements in an adaptive manner.",2,PRIMARY,Change in Energy Intake From Baseline to Post Treatment,"This primary outcome measure compared change in energy intake from baseline to post treatment between the behavioral and nutrition treatment and the education and attention control treatment.

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective data collected as part of a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial for the treatment of corticosteroid-responsive AIED with methotrexate.
SETTING: Tertiary referral centers.
PATIENTS: One hundred sixteen patients with rapidly progressive, bilateral sensorineural hearing loss.
INTERVENTION: All patients completed a 1-month course of prednisone (60 mg/d). In Phase 2, 67 patients with improvement in hearing underwent a monitored 18-week prednisone taper, resulting in 22 weeks of prednisone therapy at an average dose of 30 mg per day. Thirty-three patients were randomized to receive methotrexate in Phase 2. Thirty-four patients received prednisone and placebo.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Adverse events (AE) in patients treated with prednisone only.
RESULTS: Of 116 patients, 7 had to stop prednisone therapy during the 1-month challenge phase due to AE. Of 34 patients, 5 were unable to complete the full 22-week course of prednisone due to AE. The most common AE was hyperglycemia, which occurred in 17.6% of patients participating in Phase 2. Weight gain was also common, with a mean increase in body mass index of 1.6 kg/m2 (95% confidence interval, 0.77-2.3) during the 22-week steroid course. Patients entering Phase 2 were followed for a mean of 66 weeks. No fractures or osteonecrosis were reported.

Eradication with rescue regimens may be challenging after failure of key antibiotics such as clarithromycin and nitroimidazoles.
AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a second-line levofloxacin-containing triple regimen (PPI-amoxicillin-levofloxacin) in the eradication of H. pylori after non-bismuth quadruple-containing treatment failure.
DESIGN: prospective multicenter study.
PATIENTS: in whom a non-bismuth quadruple regimen, administered either sequentially (PPI + amoxicillin for 5 days followed by PPI + clarithromycin + metronidazole for 5 more days) or concomitantly (PPI + amoxicillin + clarithromycin + metronidazole for 10 days) had previously failed.
INTERVENTION: levofloxacin (500 mg b.i.d.), amoxicillin (1 g b.i.d.) and PPI (standard dose b.i.d.) for 10 days.
OUTCOME: eradication was confirmed with (13)C-urea breath test 4-8 weeks after therapy. Compliance and tolerance: compliance was determined through questioning and recovery of empty medication envelopes. Incidence of adverse effects was evaluated by means of a questionnaire.
RESULTS: 100 consecutive patients were included (mean age 50 years, 62% females, 12% peptic ulcer and 88% dyspepsia): 37 after ""sequential"", and 63 after ""concomitant"" treatment failure.

However, recent data indicate growing numbers of people who inject drugs (PWIDs) in north and central Indian cities.
METHODS: We conducted face-to-face surveys among PWIDs in seven northeast and eight north/central Indian cities using respondent-driven sampling. We used a rapid HIV-testing protocol to identify seropositive individuals and multiassay algorithm to identify those with recent infection. We used multilevel regression models that incorporated sampling weights and had random intercepts for site to assess risk factors for prevalent and incident (recent) HIV infection.
RESULTS: We surveyed 14 481 PWIDs from 15 Indian cities between January and December 2013. Participants reported high rates of needle/syringe sharing. The median (site range) estimated HIV prevalence and incidence were 18.1% (5.9, 44.9) and 2.9 per 100 person-years (0, 12.4), respectively. HIV prevalence was higher in northeast sites, whereas HIV incidence was higher in north/central sites. The odds of prevalent HIV were over three-fold higher in women than in men. Other factors associated with HIV prevalence or incidence included duration since first injection, injection of pharmaceutical drugs, and needle/syringe sharing.
CONCLUSIONS: The burden of HIV infection is high among PWIDs in India, and may be increasing in cities where injecting drug use is emerging.

METHODS: In this 28-day, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, multicentre study (NCT01175473), patients (mean HbA1c 7.3%) received subcutaneous lixisenatide QD (10 µg weeks 1-2, then 20 µg; n = 77) or liraglutide QD (0.6 mg week 1, 1.2 mg week 2, then 1.8 mg; n = 71) 30 min before breakfast. Primary endpoint was change in postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) exposure from baseline to day 28 during a breakfast test meal.
RESULTS: Lixisenatide reduced PPG significantly more than liraglutide [mean change in AUC(0:30-4:30h) : -12.6 vs. -4.0 h·mmol/L, respectively; p < 0.0001 (0:30 h = start of meal)].

Our aim in the REGARD (REbif vs Glatiramer Acetate in Relapsing MS Disease) study was to compare interferon beta-1a with glatiramer acetate in patients with RRMS.
METHODS: In this multicentre, randomised, comparative, parallel-group, open-label study, patients with RRMS diagnosed with the McDonald criteria who had had at least one relapse within the previous 12 months were randomised to receive 44 mug subcutaneous interferon beta-1a three times per week or 20 mg subcutaneous glatiramer acetate once per day for 96 weeks to assess the time to first relapse. A subpopulation of 460 patients (230 from each group) also had serial MRI scans to assess T2-weighted and gadolinium-enhancing lesion number and volume. Treatments were assigned by a computer-generated randomisation list that was stratified by centre. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00078338.
FINDINGS: Between February and December, 2004, 764 patients were randomly assigned: 386 to interferon beta-1a and 378 to glatiramer acetate. After 96 weeks, there was no significant difference between groups in time to first relapse (hazard ratio 0.94, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.21; p=0.64). Relapse rates were lower than expected: 258 patients (126 in the interferon beta-1a group and 132 in the glatiramer acetate group) had one or more relapses (the expected number was 460). For secondary outcomes, there were no significant differences for the number and change in volume of T2 active lesions or for the change in the volume of gadolinium-enhancing lesions, although patients treated with interferon beta-1a had significantly fewer gadolinium-enhancing lesions (0.24 vs 0.41 lesions per patient per scan, 95% CI -0.4 to 0.1; p=0.0002). Safety and tolerability profiles were consistent with the known profiles for both compounds. The overall number and severity of adverse events were similar between the treatments and were not an important cause for discontinuation of the trial during the 96 weeks.
INTERPRETATION: There was no significant difference between interferon beta-1a and glatiramer acetate in the primary outcome. The ability to predict clinical superiority on the basis of results from previous studies might be limited by a trial population with low disease activity, which is an important consideration for ongoing and future trials in patients with RRMS.",0,PRIMARY,Time to First Relapse,"Relapse was defined as new, worsening or recurrent neurological symptoms attributed to multiple sclerosis that last for at least 24 hours without fever or infection, or adverse reaction to prescribed medication, preceded by a stable or improving neurological status of at least 30 days.

BACKGROUND: From a patient's perspective, access site management after percutaneous procedures remains challenging.
METHODS: Patients enrolled in this multicenter, nonblinded trial underwent 6-F diagnostic or interventional procedures were randomly assigned 2:1 to VCD versus MC. The primary efficacy end points were time to hemostasis (TTH) and time to ambulation (TTA), and the primary safety end points were periprocedural and 30-day incidence of arterial access-related complications.
RESULTS: The trial assigned 401 patients (mean age 62.7 +/- 10.9 years, 66.1% men) to VCD (n = 267) versus MC (n = 134) after 87 ""roll-in"" patients treated at 17 participating institutions. The baseline characteristics of the groups were similar. Procedural success was 91.8% in the VCD versus 91.0% in the MC group (p = NS). Mean TTH was 4.4 +/- 11.6 min in the VCD versus 20.1 +/- 22.5 min in the MC group (95% confidence interval: 19.0 to 12.3; p < 0.0001).

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term efficacy of a single course of fluorouracil cream, 5%, for AK treatment.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Veterans Affairs Keratinocyte Carcinoma Chemoprevention (VAKCC) trial was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial with patients from dermatology clinics at 12 VA medical centers recruited from 2009 to 2011 and followed up until 2013. Our study population comprised 932 veterans with 2 or more keratinocyte carcinomas in the 5 years prior to enrollment. The mean follow-up duration was 2.6 years in both treatment and control groups.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants applied either topical fluorouracil cream, 5% (n = 468), or vehicle control cream (n = 464) to the face and ears twice daily for up to 4 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: This study reports on AK counts and treatments, which were secondary outcomes of the VAKCC trial. Actinic keratoses on the face and ears were counted by study dermatologists at enrollment and at study visits every 6 months. The number of spot treatments for AKs on the face and ears at semiannual study visits and in between study visits was recorded.
RESULTS: The number of AKs on the face and ears per participant was not different between the fluorouracil and control groups at randomization (11.1 vs 10.6, P > .10). After randomization, the fluorouracil group had fewer AKs compared with the control group at 6 months (3.0 vs 8.1, P < .001) and for the overall study duration (P < .001). The fluorouracil group also had higher complete AK clearance rates (38% vs 17% at 6 months) and fewer spot treatments at 6-month intervals, at study visits, and in between study visits during the trial (P < .01 for all). The fluorouracil group took longer to require the first spot AK treatment (6.2 months) compared with the control group (6.0 months) (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.60-0.79). The number of hypertrophic AKs was not different between the 2 groups overall (P = .60), although there were fewer hypertrophic AKs in the fluorouracil group at 6 months (0.23 vs 0.41) (P = .05).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our results indicate that a single course of fluorouracil cream, 5%, effectively reduces AK counts and the need for spot treatments for longer than 2 years.

DESIGN: Longitudinal, uncontrolled observational study evaluating results of intraoperative transfusion in patients entered into the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. We made propensity-matched comparisons between patients who received and did not receive intraoperative transfusion to minimize confounding when estimating the effect of intraoperative transfusion on postoperative outcomes.
SETTING: We queried the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database for patients undergoing operations between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2009.
PATIENTS: A large sample of surgical patients from 173 hospitals throughout the United States.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Operative mortality and serious perioperative morbidity (≥1 of 20 complications).
RESULTS: After exclusions, 941,496 operations were analyzed in patients from 173 hospitals. Most patients (893,205 patients [94.9%]) did not receive intraoperative transfusions. Patients who received intraoperative infusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells (15,186 patients [1.6%]) had higher unadjusted rates of mortality and more serious morbidity. These rates further increased with intraoperative transfusion of more than 1 unit of packed red blood cells in a dose-dependent manner. After propensity matching to adjust for multiple preoperative risks, transfusion of a single unit of packed red blood cells increased the multivariate risk of mortality, wound problems, pulmonary complications, postoperative renal dysfunction, systemic sepsis, composite morbidity, and postoperative length of stay compared with propensity-matched patients who did not receive intraoperative transfusion.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a dose-dependent adverse effect of intraoperative blood transfusion. It is likely that a small, possibly discretionary amount of intraoperative transfusion leads to increased mortality, morbidity, and resource use, suggesting that caution should be used with intraoperative transfusions for mildly hypovolemic or anemic patients.",2,PRIMARY,Total Red Blood Cells Transfused in the Intraoperative Period,Total red blood cells transfused in the intraoperative period in (mL).

Predictors and reasons for (non)usage are not well known. Identifying which factors are related to usage contributes to the recognition of subgroups who benefit most from Web-based interventions and to the development of new strategies to increase usage.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this mixed methods study was to explore patient, intervention, and study characteristics that facilitate or impede usage of a Web-based physical activity intervention for patients with knee and/or hip osteoarthritis.
METHODS: This study is part of a randomized controlled trial that investigated the effects of Web-based physical activity intervention. A total of 199 participants between 50-75 years of age with knee and/or hip osteoarthritis were randomly assigned to a Web-based intervention (n=100) or a waiting list (n=99). This mixed methods study used only data from the individuals allocated to the intervention group. Patients were defined as users if they completed at least 6 out of 9 modules. Logistic regression analyses with a stepwise backward selection procedure were executed to build a multivariate prediction usage model. For the qualitative part, semistructured interviews were conducted. Both inductive and deductive analyses were used to identify patterns in reported reasons for nonusage.
RESULTS: Of the 100 participants who received a password and username, 46 completed 6 modules or more. Multivariate regression analyses revealed that higher age (OR 0.94, P=.08) and the presence of a comorbidity (OR 0.33, P=.02) predicted nonusage. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the model was robust to changes in the usage parameter. Results from the interviews showed that a lack of personal guidance, insufficient motivation, presence of physical problems, and low mood were reasons for nonusage. In addition, the absence of human involvement was viewed as a disadvantage and it negatively impacted program usage. Factors that influenced usage positively were trust in the program, its reliability, functionality of the intervention, social support from family or friends, and commitment to the research team.
CONCLUSIONS: In this mixed methods study, we found patient, intervention, and study factors that were important in the usage and nonusage of a Web-based PA intervention for patients with knee and/or hip osteoarthritis. Although the self-guided components offer several advantages, particularly in relation to costs, reach, and access, we found that older patients and participants with a comorbid condition need a more personal approach.

The primary endpoint was MADRS total score change from augmentation baseline to week 16. Safety and tolerability measures included the occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs).
RESULTS: Least squares mean (95% CI) treatment differences (LDX-placebo) for MADRS total score changes from augmentation baseline to week 16 were not statistically significant in study 1 (0.1 [-1.7, 2.0], P=0.883) or study 2 (-0.5 [-2.3, 1.3], P=0.583).

In this study, we compared a reduction treatment approach with an immediate cessation approach in a population of ST users who reported no immediate plans to quit.
METHODS: Subjects randomly assigned to the immediate cessation condition set a quit date soon after enrollment and were offered 2 weeks of nicotine patch therapy to help in their cessation efforts. Subjects assigned to the ST reduction group were provided with their choice of either 4 mg nicotine lozenge or ST brand switching to help them reduce their ST use or levels of nicotine exposure, respectively. Quit date was 6 weeks after the onset of treatment. Follow-up was at 12 weeks and 26 weeks postenrollment and 26 weeks postquit.
RESULTS: Both 7-day point prevalence abstinence and prolonged abstinence rates following the quit date were significantly higher in the immediate cessation group versus the reduction group at 12 and 26 weeks (all p values ≤ .04) and for prolonged abstinence at 6 months postquit (p = .002). Significant reductions in ST use among nonquitters were observed for both groups (p < .0001) with no differences between groups.

OBJECTIVE: To determine if administration of BMCs through transendocardial injections improves myocardial perfusion, reduces left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV), or enhances maximal oxygen consumption in patients with coronary artery disease or LV dysfunction, and limiting heart failure or angina.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A phase 2 randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of symptomatic patients (New York Heart Association classification II-III or Canadian Cardiovascular Society classification II-IV) with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 45% or less, a perfusion defect by single-photon emission tomography (SPECT), and coronary artery disease not amenable to revascularization who were receiving maximal medical therapy at 5 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-sponsored Cardiovascular Cell Therapy Research Network (CCTRN) sites between April 29, 2009, and April 18, 2011.
INTERVENTION: Bone marrow aspiration (isolation of BMCs using a standardized automated system performed locally) and transendocardial injection of 100 million BMCs or placebo (ratio of 2 for BMC group to 1 for placebo group).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Co-primary end points assessed at 6 months: changes in LVESV assessed by echocardiography, maximal oxygen consumption, and reversibility on SPECT. Phenotypic and functional analyses of the cell product were performed by the CCTRN biorepository core laboratory.
RESULTS: Of 153 patients who provided consent, a total of 92 (82 men; average age: 63 years) were randomized (n = 61 in BMC group and n = 31 in placebo group).

In this study, PAP was compared between MV and PCV at the same tidal volume of 8-10 ml/kg during facemask ventilation for anaesthetic induction in children. The occurrence of gastric insufflation (GI) was evaluated with ultrasonography and stethoscopic auscultation.
METHODS: Forty-eight children, aged 0.5-7 years, undergoing elective urologic surgery were randomly allocated into either Group MV or Group PCV. Under light sedation with thiopental iv., ultrasonography (US) was performed and the gastric antrum was identified. After additional thiopental and rocuronium administration, facemask ventilation with a tidal volume of 8-10 ml/kg was performed for 3 min, whereas respiratory parameters were recorded at 1 min intervals.

RESULTS: In the MV group, PAP was higher at all the time points compared with the PCV group (14 vs. 9.5, 15 vs. 10 and 15 vs. 9 cmH2 O, all P < 0.05). However, there was no difference in the GI occurrence between Group MV and Group PCV (7 vs. 3, P = 0.284). There was no difference between PAP in patients with GI and without GI (P > 0.05).

An expected average of 15 minutes.,17456672,Ultrasound using the transverse approach to the lumbar spine provides reliable landmarks for labor epidurals.,"BACKGROUND: Ultrasound imaging of the spine has recently been proposed to facilitate identification of the epidural space. In this study, we assessed the accuracy and precision of the transverse approach, using a ""single-screen"" method, to facilitate labor epidurals.
METHODS: We enrolled 61 patients requesting labor epidurals. Ultrasound imaging (transverse approach, 2-5 MHz curved array probe) identified the midline, the intervertebral space, and the distance from the skin to the epidural space (ultrasound depth/UD). During the epidural puncture, we recorded the success of the insertion point, and measured the distance to the epidural space to the nearest half-centimeter of the marked Tuohy needle (needle depth/ND). We calculated the agreement between UD and ND by the concordance correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman analysis with 95% limits of agreement.
RESULTS: The average maternal age was 33 +/- 4.6 yr, body mass index 29.7 +/- 4.8, UD 4.66 +/- 0.68 cm, and ND 4.65 +/- 0.72 cm. The success of the insertion point was 91.8%, with no need to redirect the needle in 73.8% of the patients. The concordance correlation coefficient between UD and ND was 0.881 (95% CI 0.820-0.942). The 95% limits of agreement were -0.666 to 0.687 cm.

In this study, we have determined and compared the in vitro optical properties of human epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous fat with those of nonmelanoma skin cancers in the spectral range from 370 to 1600 nm. Fresh specimens of normal and cancerous human skin were obtained from surgeries. The samples were rinsed in saline solution and sectioned. Diffuse reflectance and total transmittance were measured using an integrating sphere spectrophotometer. Absorption and reduced scattering coefficients were calculated from the measured quantities using an inverse Monte Carlo technique. The differences between optical properties of each normal tissue-cancer pair were statistically analyzed. The results indicate that there are significant differences in the scattering of cancerous and healthy tissues in the spectral range from 1050 to 1400 nm. In this spectral region, the scattering of cancerous lesions is consistently lower than that of normal tissues, whereas absorption does not differ significantly, with the exception of nodular basal cell carcinomas (BCC). Nodular BCCs exhibit significantly lower absorption as compared to normal skin. Therefore, the spectral range between 1050 and 1400 nm appears to be optimal for nonmelanoma skin cancer detection.",2,PRIMARY,Global Face Total Lesion Count - Percent Change - Baseline to Week 12,Percent change from baseline in global face total lesion count at Week 12,Gel-Cream + Acne Mask,Acne Mask,"Cleanser, Gel-Cream, Acne Mask","Cleanser, Acne Mask",DEVICE,DEVICE,EXPERIMENTAL,ACTIVE_COMPARATOR,['0.538'],['ANCOVA'],['Superiority'],2006-N/A-N/A

However, investigation of the lipodystrophy syndrome has generally been limited to men; and a comprehensive evaluation of insulin, lipids, and regional body composition has not been performed in the expanding population of HIV-infected women. In this study, we assessed fasting insulin, lipid levels, virologic parameters, and regional body composition, using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, in a cohort of 75 HIV-infected women (age, 25-46 yr), in comparison with 30 healthy weight-matched premenopausal control subjects. HIV-infected women demonstrated significant truncal adiposity (38.5 +/- 0.9 vs. 34.9 +/- 1.3%, P < 0.05) hyperinsulinemia (15.9 +/- 1.5 vs. 7.5 +/- 0.6 microU/mL, P < 0.001) and an increased insulin-to-glucose ratio (0.2 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.1 +/- 0.03, P < 0.001), compared with control subjects. Insulin and the insulin-to-glucose ratio were increased, even among HIV-infected patients with low body weight (<90% of ideal body weight) (insulin, 13.3 +/- 2.8 microU/mL, P < 0.01 vs. control; insulin/glucose, 0.2 +/- 0.04, P < 0.01 vs. control). Insulin and the insulin-to-glucose ratio were most significantly elevated among patients with increased truncal adiposity (insulin, 28.2 +/- 3.2 microU/mL, P < 0.001 vs. control; insulin/ glucose, 0.32 +/- 0.04, P < 0.001 vs. control). In contrast, no differences in insulin were seen in relation to protease inhibitor (PI) use. Similarly, HIV-infected women also demonstrated significant hypertriglyceridemia (144 +/- 15 vs. 66 +/- 23 mg/dL, P < 0.01 vs. controls), which was present even among low-weight patients (148 +/- 32 mg/dL, P < 0.001 vs. control) but was not related to truncal adiposity or PI usage. These data demonstrate significant hyperinsulinemia and truncal adiposity in HIV-infected women. Our data suggest that these metabolic abnormalities occur at baseline in HIV-infected women, independent of PI use. However, these data do not rule out a direct effect of PI therapy on fat metabolism or indirect effects of PI therapy to further worsen glucose and lipid homeostasis in association with weight gain and disease recovery.",2,PRIMARY,Change in Weight,A comparison between aripiprazole group and placebo group in change in weight measured at Baseline and Week 8.,Aripiprazole,Placebo,Participants will take aripiprazole for 8 weeks.,Participants will take placebo for 8 weeks.,DRUG,DRUG,EXPERIMENTAL,PLACEBO_COMPARATOR,['0.109'],['ANCOVA'],['Non-Inferiority or Equivalence'],1999-Jun-N/A

OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to confirm weight loss with dapagliflozin and establish through body composition measurements whether weight loss is accounted for by changes in fat or fluid components.
DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a 24-wk, international, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with ongoing 78-wk site- and patient-blinded extension period at 40 sites in five countries.
PATIENTS: Included were 182 patients with T2DM (mean values: women 63.3 and men 58.6 yr of age; hemoglobin A1c 7.17%, body mass index 31.9 kg/m2, and body weight 91.5 kg) inadequately controlled on metformin.
INTERVENTION: Dapagliflozin 10 mg/d or placebo was added to open-label metformin for 24 wk.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary endpoint was total body weight (TBW) change from baseline at wk 24. Key secondary endpoints were waist circumference and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry total-body fat mass (FM) changes from baseline at wk 24, and patient proportion achieving body weight reduction of at least 5% at wk 24. In a subset of patients, magnetic resonance assessment of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and sc adipose tissue (SAT) volume and hepatic lipid content were also evaluated.
RESULTS: At wk 24, placebo-corrected changes with dapagliflozin were as follows: TBW, -2.08 kg [95% confidence interval (CI)=-2.84 to -1.31; P<0.0001]; waist circumference, -1.52 cm (95% CI=-2.74 to -0.31; P=0.0143); FM, -1.48 kg (95% CI=-2.22 to -0.74; P=0.0001); proportion of patients achieving weight reduction of at least 5%, +26.2% (95% CI=15.5 to 36.7; P<0.0001); VAT, -258.4 cm3 (95% CI=-448.1 to -68.6; nominal P=0.0084); SAT, -184.9 cm3 (95% CI=-359.7 to -10.1; nominal P=0.0385).

As per protocol, all patients had a standardized evaluation to assess wound depth, sensory neuropathy, vascular insufficiency, and infection. Patients were assessed at 6 months after their initial evaluation to see whether an amputation had been performed.
RESULTS: There was a significant overall trend toward increased prevalence of amputations as wounds increased in both depth (chi 2trend = 143.1, P < 0.001) and stage (chi 2trend = 91.0, P < 0.001).

The 'Trier Social Stress Test' (TSST) mainly consists of an anticipation period (10 min) and a test period (10 min) in which the subjects have to deliver a free speech and perform mental arithmetic in front of an audience. In six independent studies this protocol has been found to induce considerable changes in the concentration of ACTH, cortisol (serum and saliva), GH, prolactin as well as significant increases in heart rate. As for salivary cortisol levels, the TSST reliably led to 2- to 4-fold elevations above baseline with similar peak cortisol concentrations. Studies are summarized in which TSST-induced cortisol increases elucidated some of the multiple variables contributing to the interindividual variation in adrenocortical stress responses. The results suggest that gender, genetics and nicotine consumption can influence the individual's stress responsiveness to psychological stress while personality traits showed no correlation with cortisol responses to TSST stimulation.

DESIGN: Registered, individually randomized, two-group, parallel double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial.
SETTING: Academically affiliated private clinical and research center.
PATIENT(S): 141 consecutive, unselected, consenting women with no history of renal disease, sickle cell disease, or malignancy who were undergoing IVF.
INTERVENTION(S): Sealed, numbered, opaque envelopes assigned 73 patients to receive G-CSF (Filgrastim, Amgen, 300 μg/1.0 mL) and 68 to receive placebo (saline).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Endometrial thickness, clinical pregnancy, and embryo implantation rates.
RESULT(S): The mean age for the whole study group was 39.59 ± 5.56 years (G-CSF: 39.79 ± 5.13 years; placebo: 39.38 ± 6.03 years). Endometrial thickness statistically significantly increased over the 5-day observation period for the whole group by approximately 1.36 mm. The increase in the G-CSF group was not statistically significantly different from the control group. Statistical models looking at treatment effects on clinical pregnancy and implantation rates demonstrated no effect of G-CSF treatment. There were no adverse events for either treatment group.
CONCLUSION(S): In normal IVF patients, G-CSF does not affect endometrial thickness, implantation rates, or clinical pregnancy rates. Because these results were obtained in an older patient population, they may not necessarily apply to younger women.

A significant improvement in scores was also observed on the KOOS subscales of activities of daily living (MACI, 43.5 to 87.2 vs MFX, 42.6 to 75.8; P < .001), knee-related quality of life (MACI, 18.8 to 56.2 vs MFX, 17.2 to 47.3; P = .029), and other symptoms (MACI, 48.3 to 83.7 vs MFX, 44.4 to 72.2; P < .001) for patients treated with MACI compared with MFX. Repair tissue quality was good as assessed by histology/MRI, but no difference was shown between treatments. A low number of treatment failures (nonresponders: MACI, 12.5% vs MFX, 31.9%; P = .016) and no unexpected safety findings were reported.
CONCLUSION: The treatment of symptomatic cartilage knee defects ≥3 cm(2) in size using MACI was clinically and statistically significantly better than with MFX, with similar structural repair tissue and safety, in this heterogeneous patient population. Moreover, MACI offers a more efficacious alternative than MFX with a similar safety profile for the treatment of symptomatic articular cartilage defects of the knee.",1,PRIMARY,Change From Baseline to Week 104 for the Participant's Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) Pain and Function (Sports and Recreational Activities) Scores.,"The KOOS is a validated knee-specific instrument developed to assess the patients' opinion of their knee and associated problems.

Two aims were to: 1) examine demographic differences in body image discrepancy; and 2) determine the association of body image discrepancy with weight status, percent body fat, physical activity, sedentary behavior, and cardiovascular (CV) fitness among young adolescent girls.
METHODS: The cross-sectional study included a secondary analysis of baseline data from a group randomized controlled trial including 1519 5th-8th grade girls in 24 U.S. schools. Girls completed physical activity and sedentary behavior surveys. To indicate perceived current/actual and ideal body image, girls selected from nine body figures the one that represented how they look now and another showing how they want to look. Girls wore accelerometers measuring physical activity. Height, weight, and percent body fat were assessed. The Progressive Aerobic CV Endurance Run was used to estimate CV fitness. Independent t-test, one- and two-way ANOVA, correlational analyses, and hierarchical linear regressions were performed.
RESULTS: The majority (67.5%; n = 1023) chose a smaller ideal than current/actual figure. White girls had higher body image discrepancy than Black girls (p = .035). Body image discrepancy increased with increasing weight status (F

Review of possible mechanisms of action.,"The purpose of this study was to examine in man the analgesic effect of non-segmental electroacupuncture (EA) limited to a single point (Hoku hand point) and the influence of naloxone using an original modified electrical dental pain test. Results in the literature are still contradictory as to the degree and specificity of acupuncture analgesia and its opioid nature. Acupuncture techniques as well as experimental pain models are factors accounting for the discrepancies in the results. For this reason, we designed an experimental pain test characterized by a high degree of specificity, validity and reliability. We chose optimal conditions for eliciting specific acupuncture effect, i.e. non-segmental, low frequency and painful intensity range. A cross-over repeated measure experimental design was used. Five normal trained subjects participated in 65 sessions under four conditions (control, EA, EA+naloxone, EA+placebo). Changes in experimental dental pain thresholds served as indices of analgesia. The results indicated a 27% pain threshold increase after 30 minutes of EA stimulation (p less than .0001), with no differential effect between pain detection (mild pain sensation) and pain discomfort (strong pain sensation). This increase was partially blocked by the double blind injection of 0.8 mg naloxone IM (p less than .005). The experiment was designed in such a way as to prevent the occurrence of a stress analgesic effect. The endogenous opioid system was shown to be partially involved in acupuncture analgesia.

To conduct a randomized treatment trial of levetiracetam for the first-line treatment of neonatal seizures (the NEOLEV2 trial), we developed a monitoring infrastructure at five NICUs, implementing recent technological advancements to provide continuous video EEG monitoring and real-time response to seizure detection. Here, we report on the feasibility of providing this level of care.
METHODS: Twenty-five key informant interviews were conducted with study neurologists, neonatologists, coordinators, and EEG technicians from the commercial EEG monitoring company Corticare. A general inductive approach was used to analyze these qualitative data.
RESULTS: A robust infrastructure for continuous video EEG monitoring, remote review, and real-time seizure detection was established at all sites. At the time of this survey, 260 babies had been recruited and monitored for 2 to 6 days. The EEG technician review by the commercial EEG monitoring company was reassuring to families and neonatologists and led to earlier detection of seizures but did not reduce work load for neurologists. Neurologists found the automated neonatal seizure detector algorithm provided by the EEG software company Persyst useful, but the accuracy of the algorithm was not such that it could be used without review by human expert. Placement of EEG electrodes to initiate monitoring, especially after hours, remains problematic.
CONCLUSIONS: Technological advancements have made it possible to provide at-risk neonates with continuous video EEG monitoring, real-time detection of and response to seizures.

DESIGN: A randomized, controlled trial comparing CCMP with guideline-based usual care. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00395083) SETTING: 20 Veterans Affairs hospital-based outpatient clinics.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients hospitalized for COPD in the past year.
INTERVENTION: The CCMP included COPD education during 4 individual sessions and 1 group session, an action plan for identification and treatment of exacerbations, and scheduled proactive telephone calls for case management. Patients in both the intervention and usual care groups received a COPD informational booklet; their primary care providers received a copy of COPD guidelines and were advised to manage their patients according to these guidelines. Patients were randomly assigned, stratifying by site based on random, permuted blocks of variable size.
MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was time to first COPD hospitalization. Staff blinded to study group performed telephone-based assessment of COPD exacerbations and hospitalizations, and all hospitalizations were blindly adjudicated. Secondary outcomes included non-COPD health care use, all-cause mortality, health-related quality of life, patient satisfaction, disease knowledge, and self-efficacy.
RESULTS: Of the eligible patients, 209 were randomly assigned to the intervention group and 217 to the usual care group. Citing serious safety concerns, the data monitoring committee terminated the intervention before the trial's planned completion after 426 (44%) of the planned total of 960 patients were enrolled.

METHODS: We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of pregabalin (300 mg) administered before TKA and for 14 days after TKA (150-50 mg twice daily). Patients were screened for the presence of neuropathic pain at 3 and 6 mo postoperatively using the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs scale. Secondary outcomes included postsurgical recovery and rehabilitation measures, including knee range of motion, opioid consumption, postoperative pain scores, sleep disturbance, and time to discharge as well as the occurrence of postoperative systemic complications.
RESULTS: Of the 240 patients randomly assigned to the 2 treatment groups (120 in each), data for the primary outcome were obtained from 113 pregabalin patients and 115 placebo patients.

Patients receiving pregabalin also consumed less epidural opioids (P = 0.003), required less oral opioid pain medication while hospitalized (P = 0.005), and had greater active flexion over the first 30 postoperative days (P = 0.013). There were no differences in the actual recorded duration of hospitalization between the 2 groups, although time to achieve hospital discharge criteria was longer for placebo patients, 69.0 +/- 16.0 h (mean +/- SD), than that of pregabalin patients, 60.2 +/- 15.8 h (P = 0.001). Sedation (P = 0.005) and confusion (P = 0.013) were more frequent on the day of surgery and postoperative day 1 in patients receiving pregabalin.
CONCLUSION: Perioperative pregabalin administration reduces the incidence of chronic neuropathic pain after TKA, with less opioid consumption and better range of motion during the first 30 days of rehabilitation. However, in the doses tested, it is associated with a higher risk of early postoperative sedation and confusion.",1,PRIMARY,Epidural Medication Consumption Rate,"Epidural medication consumption was recorded for each 4-h interval from the completion of surgery to the time that the epidural was discontinued (same as the time to achieve hospital discharge criteria).

However, data regarding the symptoms noted in DSM-IV and timing of their expression in the menstrual cycle have had little empirical support.
OBJECTIVE: To provide evidence informing the definitional criteria for PMDD.
DESIGN: Prospective surveys.
SETTING: General community and clinical settings.
PARTICIPANTS: Two cohorts that included a representative sample and a self-identified treatment-seeking cohort. Main Outcome Measure  Daily ratings of perimenstrual symptoms and functioning.
RESULTS: Mood and physical symptoms were most severe and were accompanied by impairment in the 4 days before through the first 2 days of menses for the self-identified group and in the 3 days before through the first 3 days of menses in the community sample. The most problematic symptoms endorsed were those listed in DSM-IV, but depressed mood was less frequent than other affective symptoms. In the combined sample, 4 or more symptoms was the optimal cutoff point for maximizing both sensitivity and specificity when predicting impairment.
CONCLUSIONS: This is informative for DSM-5 in that the most symptomatic period typically includes the few days before through the first 3 days of menses rather than only the premenstrual phase. Further, we validated the salience of PMDD symptoms included in DSM-IV. Although the number of symptoms most associated with distress and impairment differed between the 2 cohorts, results from the combined cohort suggest that 4 symptoms are linked with impairment from PMDD symptoms.",1,PRIMARY,DRSP,"DRSP (Daily Rating of Severity Problems) is composed of 21 items reflecting the 11 candidate symptoms for PMDD according to DSM IV and DSM V.

This study examined whether electronic monitoring and patient diaries alter as well as measure adherence.
METHOD: A sample of 180 patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) were randomized to one of three adherence surveillance methods (electronic monitoring caps, patient medication diaries, no surveillance control group) for 4 weeks, with adherence measured by a structured interview at baseline and study endpoint; 173 (96%) participants completed the study.
RESULTS: After controlling for baseline adherence, a univariate analyses of adherence at study endpoint revealed no significant differences across groups, F(2, 169) = 0.32, p =.73, with mean adherence rates of 91.4, 92.4, and 93.8 for the electronic monitoring, diaries, and control group, respectively.

The present data, obtained from chronically instrumented fetal lambs, includes three fetuses monitored throughout spontaneous labour, six fetuses with spontaneously developed long-term ST waveform changes and another three fetuses which died in the post-operative period. Uterine contractions could by themselves cause an increase in T wave height (T/QRS ratio greater than 0.30). If the ST elevation was normalised between contractions the fetus seemed to compensate to a moderate degree of hypoxia. When oxygenation was further reduced the T wave remained elevated between contractions and a progressive increase occurred in the T/QRS ratio (greater than 0.60) during the final stages of labour, in parallel with increasing blood lactate levels. Long-term ST changes with T/QRS consistently exceeding 0.30 were found to be related to low haemoglobin levels and/or fetal hypotension. Subsequently, all these fetuses died during labour as compared with a survival rate of 40% in fetuses showing a normal ST waveform. In this group negative T waves are reported as a sign of failing myocardial response to hypoxia. Death in utero, whatever the cause (bleeding, infection or spontaneous hypoxia) was always preceded by marked ST waveform changes.

BACKGROUND: Statin therapy significantly reduces the risk for thrombotic events. Whether or not these benefits are attributable to reduction in plaque lipid content remains to be properly documented in human obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD).
METHODS: We randomized 87 patients with multivessel CAD undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention and at least 1 other severely obstructive (fractional flow reserve [FFR] ≤0.8) nontarget lesion (NTL) to intensive (rosuvastatin 40 mg daily) or standard-of-care lipid-lowering therapy. NTLs were evaluated at baseline and after 7 weeks of therapy with FFR, near-infrared spectroscopy, and intravascular ultrasound. The primary endpoint was the change in lipid-core burden index at the 4-mm maximal segment (LCBI4mm max), wherever this occurred within the lesion.
RESULTS: Upon follow-up, median reduction (95% confidence interval) in LCBI4mm max was significantly greater in the intensive versus standard group (-149.1 [-210.9 to -42.9] vs. 2.4 [-36.1 to 44.7]; p = 0.01). Results remained consistent after adjustment for baseline differences in LCBI between groups and use of change in LCBI across the entire lesion as the dependent outcome.

Average over 4 weeks,24112999,Neurophysiologic effects of repeated exposure to antidepressant medication: are brain functional changes during antidepressant administration influenced by learning processes?,"Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a lifelong and recurrent illness, such that many individuals require multiple courses of antidepressant medication treatment. While some patients respond completely to each course of treatment, many do not, and with each unsuccessful antidepressant trial the likelihood that a patient will respond decreases. This raises the possibility that neurophysiologic response in subsequent antidepressant treatment may be influenced by learning processes including sensitization, habituation, and/or classical conditioning. Classical conditioning would entail the association of cues such as pill-taking (conditioned stimuli; CS) with the effects of active medication (unconditioned stimulus; US), such that later presentation of the CS alone would come to elicit a conditioned response (CR). Such effects could be revealed by blinded administration of placebo following a period of treatment with active medication. Habituation effects (tolerance), or sensitization effects (increased response), which require only repeated exposure to a stimulus, might be evidenced after repeated courses of antidepressant treatment. Knowledge of how learning processes impact neurophysiologic response to successive courses of antidepressant treatment would have relevance for clinical populations. Specific hypotheses, however, may be tested in healthy non-clinical samples to avoid potential confounding factors related to severity or chronicity of illness. Learning theories would suggest two hypotheses: (1) neurophysiologic response to placebo will differ between subjects who were previously treated with antidepressant treatment as compared to placebo (classical conditioning hypothesis); and (2) neurophysiologic response to an initial course of antidepressant treatment will differ from response to a repeated course of antidepressant treatment. Pilot data addressed these hypotheses in healthy never-depressed women who had previously received four weeks of venlafaxine IR, 150 mg (antidepressant-experienced subjects; n=2) or matching placebo (antidepressant-naive subjects; n=4) under double-blind conditions. Six-and-a-half years later, we treated these six women with placebo for one week, followed by four weeks of double-blind treatment with venlafaxine IR, 150 mg. Brain functional changes over the course of treatment were assessed using quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) to compare prefrontal neurophysiologic responses between subjects who had, versus had not, previously been exposed to venlafaxine. Antidepressant-experienced versus antidepressant-naive subjects showed greater decreases in prefrontal cordance (PFC) during venlafaxine administration (sensitization hypothesis) but did not show significantly different PFC changes during treatment with placebo in this small pilot sample (classical conditioning hypothesis). Data suggest that brief treatment with antidepressant medication may have an enduring impact on neurophysiologic responses to a subsequent course of antidepressant treatment. Hypotheses should be tested in larger samples.",0,PRIMARY,Changes in Quantitative Electroencephalogram (qEEG) Prefrontal Cordance (PFC) Over Time (4 Weeks).,"Cordance values were calculated from conventional 'absolute' and 'relative' qEEG power measures using a three-step procedure.

These problems can severely affect individuals' quality of life. In our prior research, we have developed indicators to measure the quality of care delivered to patients with Parkinson's disease, and we identified gaps in delivering evidence-based treatments for this population. Effective strategies to close these gaps are needed to improve patient quality of life.
METHODS/DESIGN: Building on prior research we developed a multi-faceted proactive implementation program called Care Coordination for Health Promotion and Activities in Parkinson's Disease (CHAPS). To be eligible, patients had to have at least two visits with a primary diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (ICD-9 code: 332.0) at one of five Veterans Affairs Medical Centers in the southwestern United States from 2010 to 2014. The program consists of telephone assessments, evidence-based protocols, and tools to enhance patient self-management, care planning, and coordination of care across providers, including an electronic database to support and track coordination of care. Our mixed-methods study employs a randomized, controlled trial design to test whether the CHAPS intervention improves performance in 38 quality measures among an analytic sample of 346 patients. The 38 quality measures are categorized into overarching areas of communication, education, and continuity; regulatory reporting; diagnosis; periodic assessment; medication use; management of motor and non-motor symptoms; use of non-pharmacological approaches and therapies; palliative care; and health maintenance. Secondary outcomes are patient health-related quality of life, self-efficacy, and perceptions of care quality. We are also evaluating the extent of the CHAPS Program implementation and measuring program costs and impacts on health services utilization, in order to perform a analysis of the CHAPS program from the perspective of the Veterans Health Administration (VA). Outcomes are assessed by interviewer-administered surveys collected at baseline and at 6, 12, and 18 months, and by medical record chart abstractions. Analyses will be intention-to-treat.

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective data collected as part of a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial for the treatment of corticosteroid-responsive AIED with methotrexate.
SETTING: Tertiary referral centers.
PATIENTS: One hundred sixteen patients with rapidly progressive, bilateral sensorineural hearing loss.
INTERVENTION: All patients completed a 1-month course of prednisone (60 mg/d). In Phase 2, 67 patients with improvement in hearing underwent a monitored 18-week prednisone taper, resulting in 22 weeks of prednisone therapy at an average dose of 30 mg per day.

METHODS: We conducted a prospective quality initiative study by recruiting all English-speaking patients undergoing hysterectomy for benign, nonobstetric indications at a university hospital between August 2015 and December 2015, excluding those with major medical morbidities or substance abuse. Before hysterectomy, patients completed the Fibromyalgia Survey, a validated measure of centralized pain. After hysterectomy, opioid use (converted to oral morphine equivalents) and pain scores (0-10 numeric rating scale) were collected by a daily diary and a structured telephone interview 14 days after surgery. Primary outcomes were total opioid prescribed and consumed in the 2 weeks after hysterectomy. Secondary outcomes included daily opioid use and daily pain severity for 14 days after hysterectomy.
RESULTS: Of 103 eligible patients, 102 (99%) agreed to participate, including 44 (43.1%) laparoscopic, 42 (41.2%) vaginal, and 16 (15.7%) abdominal hysterectomies.

DynaMed is a database of synthesized evidence. We investigated whether primary care clinicians would answer more clinical questions, change clinical decision making, and alter search time using DynaMed in addition to their usual information sources.
METHODS: Fifty-two primary care clinicians naïve to DynaMed searched for answers to 698 of their own clinical questions using the Internet. On a per-question basis, participants were randomized to have access to DynaMed (A) or not (N) in addition to their usual information sources. Outcomes included proportions of questions answered, proportions of questions with answers that changed clinical decision making, and median search times. The statistical approach of per-participant analyses of clinicians who asked questions in both A and N states was decided before data collection.
RESULTS: Among 46 clinicians in per-participant analyses, 23 (50%) answered a greater proportion of questions during A than N, and 13 (28.3%) answered more questions during N than A (P = .05). Finding answers that changed clinical decision making occurred more often during A (25 clinicians, 54.3%) than during N (13 clinicians, 28.3%) (P = .01). Search times did not differ significantly. Overall, participants found answers for 263 (75.8%) of 347 A questions and 250 (71.2%) of 351 N questions. Answers changed clinical decision making for 224 (64.6%) of the A questions and 209 (59.5%) of the N questions.

DATA SOURCES: Literature was retrieved through MEDLINE (1946-September 2011) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-September 2011) using the terms tranexamic acid, aminocaproic acid, antifibrinolytic, topical, and surgical. In addition, reference citations from publications identified were reviewed.
STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All identified articles in English were evaluated. Clinical trials, case reports, and meta-analyses describing topical use of tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid to prevent postoperative bleeding were included.
DATA SYNTHESIS: A total of 16 publications in the setting of major surgical procedures were included; the majority of data were for tranexamic acid. For cardiac surgery, 4 trials used solutions containing tranexamic acid (1-2.5 g in 100-250 mL of 0.9% NaCl), and 1 trial assessed a solution containing aminocaproic acid (24 g in 250 mL of 0.9% NaCl). These solutions were poured into the chest cavity before sternotomy closure. For orthopedic procedures, all of the data were for topical irrigation solutions containing tranexamic acid (500 mg-3 g in 50-100 mL of 0.9% NaCl) or for intraarticular injections of tranexamic acid (250 mg to 2 g in 20-50 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride, with or without carbazochrome sodium sulfate). Overall, use of topical tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid reduced postoperative blood loss; however, few studies reported a significant reduction in the number of packed red blood cell transfusions or units given, intensive care unit stay, or length of hospitalization.

Individuals with nocturnal hypercapnia but daytime normocapnia were randomised to a control group or nocturnal NIV to examine whether nocturnal hypoventilation is a valid indication for NIV.
METHODS: Forty eight patients with congenital neuromuscular or chest wall disease aged 7-51 years and vital capacity<50% predicted underwent overnight respiratory monitoring. Twenty six with daytime normocapnia and nocturnal hypercapnia were randomised to either nocturnal NIV or to a control group without ventilatory support.

METHODS: In 50 female Medical students, this study was conducted. Age, weight and height was taken, a detailed history and clinical examination was performed. Blood was drawn for 25 Hydroxy Vitamin D3 (25OHD) level. Two women had >30 ng/mL of 25OHD and was excluded from the study. The participants were divided into two groups of 24 in each arm. All participants equivocally agreed not to change their dietary habits and life style till the study was over. The study group of women were asked to apply; Top-D (Aloe Vera based- Vitamin D3) (Patency Pending) was developed at King Fahd Hospital of the University, AlKhobar with each gram of the Top-D cream delivering 5000 IU of vitamin D3. The second group used 1 gram of Aloe vera gel. The participants had no knowledge to which group they belong. A second blood sample was taken at the end of 3 months and the data was analyzed.
RESULTS: The data of 48 women was available for analysis. The average age was 22.58 ± 1.95 years.

Extended-release depot formulations may improve adherence, but long-term adherence rates to depot naltrexone are not known. This study determined long-term rates of adherence to depot naltrexone and whether employment-based reinforcement can improve adherence.
DESIGN: Participants who were inducted onto oral naltrexone were assigned randomly to contingency (n = 18) or prescription (n = 17) groups. Participants were offered six depot naltrexone injections and invited to work at the therapeutic workplace on week days for 26 weeks, where they earned stipends for participating in job skills training. Contingency participants were required to accept naltrexone injections to maintain workplace access and to maintain maximum pay. Prescription participants could work independently of whether they accepted injections.
SETTING: The therapeutic workplace, a model employment-based intervention for drug addiction and unemployment.
PARTICIPANTS: Opioid-dependent unemployed adults.
MEASUREMENTS: Depot naltrexone injections accepted and opiate-negative urine samples.
FINDINGS: Contingency participants accepted significantly more naltrexone injections than prescription participants (81% versus 42%), and were more likely to accept all injections (66% versus 35%). At monthly assessments (with missing urine samples imputed as positive), the groups provided similar percentages of samples negative for opiates (74% versus 62%) and for cocaine (56% versus 54%). Opiate-positive samples were more likely when samples were also positive for cocaine.

These abnormalities are thought to reflect a deficiency in the synchronization of pyramidal cell activity that is dependent, in part, on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission through GABA type A (GABA(A)) receptors containing alpha(2) subunits. The authors conducted a proof-of-concept clinical trial designed to test the hypothesis that a novel compound with relatively selective agonist activity at GABA(A) receptors containing alpha(2) subunits would improve cognitive function and gamma band oscillations in individuals with schizophrenia.
METHOD: Participants were male subjects (N=15) with chronic schizophrenia who were randomly assigned to receive 4 weeks of treatment with the study drug MK-0777, a benzodiazepine-like agent with selective activity at GABA(A) receptors containing alpha(2) or alpha(3) subunits, or a matched placebo in a double-blind fashion. Outcome measures were the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status, three tests of working memory and/or cognitive control (N-back, AX Continuous Performance Test, and Preparing to Overcome Prepotency), and EEG measures of gamma band oscillations induced during the Preparing to Overcome Prepotency task.
RESULTS: Compared with placebo, the MK-0777 compound was associated with improved performance on the N-back, AX Continuous Performance Test, and Preparing to Overcome Prepotency tasks. The compound was also associated with increased frontal gamma band power during the Preparing to Overcome Prepotency task. No effects of the MK-0777 compound were detected in BPRS or Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status scores, with the exception of improvement on the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status delayed memory index. The MK-0777 agent was well-tolerated.

METHODS: Adult patients initiating ART in a public clinic in Cape Town, South Africa, were randomized to treatment-supporter DOT-ART or self-administered ART. DOT-ART patients and supporters received baseline and follow-up training and monitoring. The primary endpoints were the proportions of patients with HIV viral load less than 400 copies/ml and change in CD4 cell counts at 12 and 24 months.
RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy-four patients enrolled (137 in each arm) and baseline characteristics were similar for both arms. The study was stopped early for futility by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board. In an intention-to-treat analysis, the proportions of patients with viral load less than 400 copies/ml at 12 months were 72.8% in the DOT-ART arm and 68.4% in the Self-ART arm (P = 0.42). DOT-ART patients had greater median CD4 cell count (cells/microl) increases at 6 months [148 (IQR 84-222) vs. 111 (IQR 44-196) P = 0.02] but similar results at all other time-points.

This study examined effects on outcomes, service costs, and user satisfaction among adults with serious mental illness.
METHODS: Public mental health system clients were randomly assigned to self-directed care (N=114) versus services as usual (N=102) and assessed at baseline and 12 and 24 months. The primary outcome was self-perceived recovery. Secondary outcomes included psychosocial status, psychiatric symptom severity, and behavioral rehabilitation indicators. Mixed-effects random-regression analysis tested for longitudinal changes in outcomes between the two conditions. Differences in service costs were analyzed with negative binomial and zero-inflated negative binomial regression models.
RESULTS: Compared with the control group, self-directed care participants had significantly greater improvement over time in recovery, self-esteem, coping mastery, autonomy support, somatic symptoms, employment, and education. No between-group differences were found in total per-person service costs in years 1 and 2 or both years combined. However, self-directed care participants were more likely than control group participants to have zero costs for six of 12 individual services and to have lower costs for four. The most frequent nontraditional purchases were for transportation (21%), communication (17%), medical care (15%), residential (14%), and health and wellness needs (11%).

Approved therapies do not halt disease progression.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of recombinant human pentraxin 2 vs placebo on change from baseline to week 28 in mean forced vital capacity (FVC) percentage of predicted value.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 18 sites in 7 countries of eligible patients with IPF (N = 117; aged 40-80 years; FVC ≥50% and ≤90% predicted; ratio of forced expiratory volume in the first second/FVC >0.70; diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide [Dlco] ≥25% and ≤90% predicted; and distance of ≥150 m on the 6-minute walk test). Study period was August 2015-May 2017.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to receive either recombinant human pentraxin 2 (10 mg/kg intravenous every 4 weeks, n = 77) or placebo (n = 39) for 24 weeks, and stratified by concurrent IPF treatment status.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was the least-squares mean change in FVC percentage of predicted value from baseline to week 28 (minimal clinically important difference, decline of 2%-6%). Secondary end points included mean change in lung volumes (total, normal, and interstitial lung abnormalities) on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and 6-minute walk distance (minimal clinically important difference, 24-45 m).
RESULTS: Of 117 randomized patients, 116 received at least 1 dose of study drug (mean age, 68.6 years; 81.0% men; mean time since IPF diagnosis, 3.8 years), and 111 (95.7%) completed the study. The least-squares mean change in FVC percentage of predicted value from baseline to week 28 in patients treated with recombinant human pentraxin 2 was -2.5 vs -4.8 for those in the placebo group (difference, +2.3 [90% CI, 1.1 to 3.5]; P = .001). No significant treatment differences were observed in total lung volume (difference, 93.5 mL [90% CI, -27.7 to 214.7]), quantitative parenchymal features on HRCT (normal lung volume difference, -1.2% [90% CI, -4.4 to 1.9]; interstitial lung abnormalities difference, 1.1% [90% CI, -2.2 to 4.3]), or measurement of Dlco (difference, -0.4 [90% CI, -2.6 to 1.7]). The change in 6-minute walk distance was -0.5 m for patients treated with recombinant human pentraxin 2 vs -31.8 m for those in the placebo group (difference, +31.3 m [90% CI, 17.4 to 45.1]; P < .001). The most common adverse events in the recombinant human pentraxin 2 vs placebo group were cough (18% vs 5%), fatigue (17% vs 10%), and nasopharyngitis (16% vs 23%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this preliminary study, recombinant human pentraxin 2 vs placebo resulted in a slower decline in lung function over 28 weeks for patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Further research should more fully assess efficacy and safety.

The source and function of CTpr production in sepsis, however, remains an enigma. In the classical view, the transcription of the CT-I gene is restricted to neuroendocrine cells, in particular the C cells of the thyroid. To better understand the pathophysiology of CTpr induction in sepsis, we used an animal model analog to human sepsis, in which bacterial infection is induced in hamsters by implanting Escherichia coli pellets ip. Compared with control hamsters, levels of CTpr were elevated several fold in septic plasma and in nearly all septic hamster tissues analyzed. Unexpectedly, CT-messenger RNA was ubiquitously and uniformly expressed in multiple tissues throughout the body in response to sepsis. Notably, the transcriptional expression of CT-messenger RNA seemed more widely up-regulated in sepsis than were classical cytokines (e.g. tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A randomized controlled 3-month trial was conducted with two post-treatment assessments of 200 breast cancer survivors assigned to either 12 weeks of 90-minute twice per week hatha yoga classes or a wait-list control. The main outcome measures were lipopolysaccharide-stimulated production of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and scores on the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF), the vitality scale from the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form (SF-36), and the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale.
RESULTS: Immediately post-treatment, fatigue was not lower (P > .05) but vitality was higher (P = .01) in the yoga group compared with the control group. At 3 months post-treatment, fatigue was lower in the yoga group (P = .002), vitality was higher (P = .01), and IL-6 (P = .027), TNF-α (P = .027), and IL-1β (P = .037) were lower for yoga participants compared with the control group. Groups did not differ on depression at either time (P > .2). Planned secondary analyses showed that the frequency of yoga practice had stronger associations with fatigue at both post-treatment visits (P = .019; P < .001), as well as vitality (P = .016; P = .0045), but not depression (P > .05) than simple group assignment; more frequent practice produced larger changes. At 3 months post-treatment, increasing yoga practice also led to a decrease in IL-6 (P = .01) and IL-1β (P = .03) production but not in TNF-α production (P > .05).

Time point of measurement: 20 min after the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).,15166838,Postresuscitation disease after cardiac arrest: a sepsis-like syndrome?,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Despite advances in cardiac arrest resuscitation, neurologic impairments and other organ dysfunctions cause considerable mortality and morbidity after restoration of spontaneous cardiac activity. The mechanisms underlying this postresuscitation disease probably involve a whole-body ischemia and reperfusion syndrome that triggers a systemic inflammatory response.
RECENT FINDINGS: Postresuscitation disease is characterized by high levels of circulating cytokines and adhesion molecules, the presence of plasma endotoxin, and dysregulated leukocyte production of cytokines: a profile similar to that seen in severe sepsis. Transient myocardial dysfunction can occur after resuscitation, mainly as a result of myocardial stunning. However, early successful angioplasty is independently associated with better outcomes after cardiac arrest associated with myocardial infarction. Coagulation abnormalities occur consistently after successful resuscitation, and their severity is associated with mortality. For example, plasma protein C and S activities after successful resuscitation are lower in nonsurvivors than in survivors. Low baseline cortisol levels may be associated with an increased risk of fatal early refractory shock after cardiac arrest, suggesting adrenal dysfunction in these patients.
SUMMARY: Postresuscitation abnormalities after cardiac arrest mimic the immunologic and coagulation disorders observed in severe sepsis. This suggests that therapeutic approaches used recently with success in severe sepsis should be investigated in patients successfully resuscitated after cardiac arrest.",2,PRIMARY,Early Postresuscitation Arterial Blood Pressure (mmHg) Measured Through Institution of Invasive Intra-arterial Pressure Monitoring (as Feasible).,"Results on early postresuscitation, mean arterial blood pressure (mmHg) are provided for the first, pre-specified time point of measurement, i.e. at 20 min after the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).",Steroids Group,Control Group,"Intervention: Stress-dose Steroids.

DESIGN: Twenty HIV and 10 non-HIV-infected subjects consumed a standardized low sodium or liberal sodium diet to stimulate or suppress the RAAS, respectively. RAAS parameters were evaluated in response to each diet and a graded angiotensin II infusion. Further analyses were performed after groups were substratified by median VAT measured by magnetic resonance imaging.
RESULTS: Aldosterone concentrations during the low-sodium diet were higher in HIV than non-HIV-infected subjects [13.8 (9.7, 30.9) vs 9.2 (7.6, 13.6) ng/dL, P = .03] and increased across groups stratified by visceral adipose tissue (VAT) [8.5 (7.1, 12.8), 9.2 (8.1, 21.5), 11.4 (9.4, 13.8), and 27.2 (13.0, 36.9) ng/dL in non-HIV-infected without increased VAT, non-HIV-infected with increased VAT, HIV-infected without increased VAT, HIV-infected with increased VAT, respectively, overall trend P = .02].

Differences in the suppressibility of plasma renin activity by graded angiotensin infusion were seen stratifying by VAT among the HIV-infected group (P < .02 at each dose). In addition, aldosterone (P = .007) was an independent predictor of insulin resistance in multivariate modeling, controlling for VAT and adiponectin.

9849,NCT00066573,Exemestane is superior to Anastrozole in terms of Event-free Survival 5 years,23358971,Exemestane versus anastrozole in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer: NCIC CTG MA.27--a randomized controlled phase III trial.,"PURPOSE: In patients with hormone-dependent postmenopausal breast cancer, standard adjuvant therapy involves 5 years of the nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors anastrozole and letrozole. The steroidal inhibitor exemestane is partially non-cross-resistant with nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors and is a mild androgen and could prove superior to anastrozole regarding efficacy and toxicity, specifically with less bone loss.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We designed an open-label, randomized, phase III trial of 5 years of exemestane versus anastrozole with a two-sided test of superiority to detect a 2.4% improvement with exemestane in 5-year event-free survival (EFS). Secondary objectives included assessment of overall survival, distant disease-free survival, incidence of contralateral new primary breast cancer, and safety.
RESULTS: In the study, 7,576 women (median age, 64.1 years) were enrolled. At median follow-up of 4.1 years, 4-year EFS was 91% for exemestane and 91.2% for anastrozole (stratified hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.18; P = .85). Overall, distant disease-free survival and disease-specific survival were also similar. In all, 31.6% of patients discontinued treatment as a result of adverse effects, concomitant disease, or study refusal. Osteoporosis/osteopenia, hypertriglyceridemia, vaginal bleeding, and hypercholesterolemia were less frequent on exemestane, whereas mild liver function abnormalities and rare episodes of atrial fibrillation were less frequent on anastrozole. Vasomotor and musculoskeletal symptoms were similar between arms.
CONCLUSION: This first comparison of steroidal and nonsteroidal classes of aromatase inhibitors showed neither to be superior in terms of breast cancer outcomes as 5-year initial adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal breast cancer by two-way test. Less toxicity on bone is compatible with one hypothesis behind MA.27 but requires confirmation. Exemestane should be considered another option as up-front adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.",0,PRIMARY,Event-free Survival,"Event free survival, the primary endpoint of this study, is defined as the time from randomization to the time of documented locoregional or distant recurrence, new primary breast cancer, or death from any cause.",Exemestane,Anastrozole,"Patients receive oral exemestane (25 mg) once daily for 5 years.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty patients with type 1 diabetes initiated the study at the Universities of Virginia, Padova, and Montpellier and Sansum Diabetes Research Institute; 18 completed the entire protocol. Each patient participated in two 40-h outpatient sessions, CLC versus OL, in randomized order. Sensor (Dexcom G4) and insulin pump (Tandem t:slim) were connected to Diabetes Assistant (DiAs)-a smartphone artificial pancreas platform. The patient operated the system through the DiAs user interface during both CLC and OL; study personnel supervised on site and monitored DiAs remotely. There were no dietary restrictions; 45-min walks in town and restaurant dinners were included in both CLC and OL; alcohol was permitted.
RESULTS: The primary outcome-reduction in risk for hypoglycemia as measured by the low blood glucose (BG) index (LGBI)-resulted in an effect size of 0.64, P = 0.003, with a twofold reduction of hypoglycemia requiring carbohydrate treatment: 1.2 vs. 2.4 episodes/session on CLC versus OL (P = 0.02).

STUDY DESIGN: Chronically instrumented, near-term fetal sheep received 1-minute total umbilical cord occlusion either every 5 minutes for 4 hours (1:5 group, n = 8), or every 2.5 minutes until blood pressure fell <20 mm Hg on 2 successive occlusions (1:2.5 group, n = 8).
RESULTS: Umbilical cord occlusion caused variable decelerations, with sustained hypertension in the 1:5 group and little change in acid-base status (pH = 7.34 +/- 0.07 after 4 hours). In contrast, the 1:2.5 group showed progressive hypotension and metabolic acidemia (pH 6.92 +/- 0.1 after the final occlusion). There was a marked increase in ST waveform height during occlusions; this increase was greater in the 1:2.5 group (P <.001), but there was overlap between the groups. ST waveform height between occlusions was significantly higher in the 1:2.5 group (P <.001) until negative and biphasic ST waveforms developed in these fetuses between occlusions in the final 30 minutes.
CONCLUSION: ST waveform elevation occurs during umbilical cord occlusions but only crudely reflects the severity of hypoxia.

METHODS: This single-center, open-label randomized clinical trial RIDILOTT DVT enrolled patients with their first femoropopliteal DVT confirmed by duplex ultrasound scan (DUS). Participants were randomly allocated to the control group (standard treatment with rivaroxaban for six months and ECS for 12 months) or the experimental group (standard treatment with the additional use of diosmin 600 mg once daily for 12 months). Patients were followed for 12 months. The primary outcome was post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS), according to the Villalta Score (≥5). The secondary outcomes were deep vein recanalization, chronic venous disease (CVD) progression, the severity of PTS (Villalta), and CVD (VCSS), quality of life (CIVIQ-20), venous thromboembolism recurrence, and adverse event (AE).
RESULTS: Ninety patients were randomized (45 per group). There were 56 men and 34 women with a mean age of 57.8±13.4 years, and 69% had clinically unprovoked DVT.

In this study, the efficacy of amiodarone for prevention of post-pulmonary resection AF was investigated.
METHODS: One hundred thirty patients undergoing lobectomy, bilobectomy, or pneumonectomy were randomly assigned prospectively to receive amiodarone (n = 65) or no prophylaxis (control group, n = 65). The amiodarone group received 1,050 mg by continuous intravenous infusion over 24 hours, initiated at the time of anesthesia induction, followed by 400 mg orally twice daily until hospital discharge or for a maximum of 6 days. The primary endpoint was AF requiring treatment during hospitalization. Secondary endpoints included postoperative length of hospital and intensive care unit stays.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the amiodarone and control groups in demographics, comorbid conditions, extent of pulmonary resection, or preoperative or postoperative use of beta-blockers or calcium-channel blockers. The incidence of AF was lower in the amiodarone group than in the control group (13.8% versus 32.3%, p = 0.02; relative risk reduction = 57%).

Results. Participants described rigid, often antihomosexual expectations of masculinity from their families, peers, and communities. Consistent with GRS, this conflict and pressure to conform to these expectations despite their homosexuality led to psychological distress, efforts to camouflage their homosexuality, and strategies to prove their masculinity. Participants believed this conflict and the associated experience of GRS might increase HIV risk through social isolation, poor self-esteem, reduced access to HIV prevention messages, and limited parental-family involvement in sexuality development and early sexual decision-making.

METHODS: 443 patients of the Veterans Health Administration diagnosed with a depressive disorder completed the Beck Depression Inventory, Interpersonal Support Evaluation List, and Beck Hopelessness Scale, from which we derived measures of burdensomeness, belongingness, and hopelessness consistent with the interpersonal theory of suicide. Measures of active and passive suicidal ideation were constructed from the Beck Suicide Scale and Beck Depression Inventory obtained at baseline and 3-months follow-up. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of passive and active suicidal ideation while adjusting for demographic characteristics and somatic-affective symptoms of depression (e.g., anhedonia, insomnia).
RESULTS: Burdensomeness and hopelessness were significantly associated with passive suicidal ideation at baseline and 3 months follow-up, but belongingness and the interaction between belongingness and burdensomeness were not significant predictors as proposed by the interpersonal theory of suicide. Somatic-affective depressive symptoms, but not any of the main effects predicted by the interpersonal theory of suicide or their interactions, were associated with active suicidal ideation at baseline. No factors were consistently associated with active suicidal ideation at 3 months follow-up.
LIMITATIONS: The measure of burdensomeness used in this study only partially represents the construct described by the interpersonal theory of suicide.
CONCLUSION: We found little support for the predictions of the interpersonal theory of suicide.

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.
DATA SOURCES: Ovid Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to May 2012, without restriction by language or publication status.
REVIEW METHODS: Randomised trials that compared ultrasound imaging with standard methods (no imaging) in the performance of a lumbar puncture or epidural catheterisation were identified.
RESULTS: 14 studies with a total of 1334 patients were included (674 patients assigned to the ultrasound group, 660 to the control group). Five studies evaluated lumbar punctures and nine evaluated epidural catheterisations. Six of 624 procedures conducted in the ultrasound group failed; 44 of 610 procedures in the control group failed. Ultrasound imaging reduced the risk of failed procedures (risk ratio 0.21 (95% confidence interval 0.10 to 0.43), P<0.001). Risk reduction was similar when subgroup analysis was performed for lumbar punctures (risk ratio 0.19 (0.07 to 0.56), P=0.002) or epidural catheterisations (0.23 (0.09 to 0.60), P=0.003). Ultrasound imaging also significantly reduced the risk of traumatic procedures (risk ratio 0.27 (0.11 to 0.67), P=0.005), the number of insertion attempts (mean difference -0.44 (-0.64 to -0.24), P<0.001), and the number of needle redirections (mean difference -1.00 (-1.24 to -0.75), P<0.001).

This study was proposed to quantify the magnitude of the problem.
METHODS: Fifteen patients undergoing gastric bypass had oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) recorded continuously, but not displayed, for 24h postoperatively; eight also had arterial blood analysis every 4h. All received narcotic PCA. SpO(2)<90% lasting more than 10 s was reviewed. Results are mean+/-SEM.
RESULTS: Mean age was 44+/-4 y, and mean BMI was 48+/-2kg/m(2); 77% had OSA. Every patient had more than one episode with SpO(2)<90% for longer than 30s undetected by routine monitoring; most had multiple episodes. Nadir SpO(2) averaged 75% +/- 8%. Mean longest duration of desaturation below 90% averaged 21+/-15min. Mean PaCO(2) was 37+/-3mm Hg; maximum PaCO(2) was 47mm Hg.
CONCLUSIONS: Severe and prolonged episodes of hypoxemia were a consistent finding, despite aggressive preoperative diagnosis and treatment of OSA, including use of CPAP postoperatively. Although some postoperative hypoventilation was expected, the degree and frequency of desaturation were surprising. No patient exhibited arterial PaCO(2) evidence of hypoventilation. No patient experienced cardiopulmonary arrest/instability, in spite of severe, repeated episodes of hypoxemia. In no instance was a significant hypoxemic episode suspected or detected. Continuous pulse oximetry monitoring, with an audible alarm set for a saturation less than 90% for 10 s, would have alerted providers to 100% of significant hypoxemic episodes.

We did this phase 3 trial to examine the safety and efficacy of such treatment in children.
METHODS: In this final analysis of a phase 3, randomised, multicentre, double-blind study, patients aged 6 months to 17 years with a documented malignancy who were scheduled to receive either moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy were randomly assigned with an interactive voice response system to an age-based and weight-based blinded regimen of aprepitant (125 mg for ages 12-17 years; 3·0 mg/kg up to 125 mg for ages 6 months to <12 years) plus ondansetron on day 1, followed by aprepitant (80 mg for ages 12-17 years; 2·0 mg/kg up to 80 mg for ages 6 months to <12 years) on days 2 and 3, or placebo plus ondansetron on day 1 followed by placebo on days 2 and 3; addition of dexamethasone was allowed. Randomisation was stratified according to patient age, planned use of chemotherapy associated with very high risk of emetogenicity, and planned use of dexamethasone as an anti-emetic. Ondansetron was dosed per the product label for paediatric use or local standard of care. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved complete response (defined as no vomiting, no retching, and no use of rescue medication) during the 25-120 h (delayed phase) after initiation of emetogenic chemotherapy. Efficacy and safety analyses were done with all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01362530.
FINDINGS: Between Sept 22, 2011, and Aug 16, 2013, 307 patients were randomly assigned at 49 sites in 24 countries to either the aprepitant group (155 patients) or to the control group (152 patients). Three patients in the aprepitant group and two in the control group did not receive study medication, and thus were excluded from analyses. 77 (51%) of 152 patients in the aprepitant group and 39 (26%) of 150 in the control group achieved a complete response in the delayed phase (p<0·0001). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were febrile neutropenia (23 [15%] of 152 in the aprepitant group vs 21 [14%] of 150 in the control group), anaemia (14 [9%] vs 26 [17%]), and decreased neutrophil count (11 [7%] vs 17 [11%]). The most common serious adverse event was febrile neutropenia (23 [15%] patients in the aprepitant group vs 22 [15%] in the control group).

METHODS: We performed a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 449 consecutive patients undergoing ERCP at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, from March 2013 through December 2014. Approximately 70% of the cohort were at average risk for PEP. Subjects were assigned randomly to groups given either a single 100-mg dose of rectal indomethacin (n = 223) or a placebo suppository (n = 226) during the procedure. The primary outcome was the development of post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP), defined by new upper-abdominal pain, a lipase level more than 3-fold the upper limit of normal, and hospitalization after ERCP for 2 consecutive nights.
RESULTS: There were no differences between the groups in baseline clinical or procedural characteristics. Sixteen patients in the indomethacin group (7.2%) and 11 in the placebo group (4.9%) developed PEP (P = .33). Complications and the severity of PEP were similar between groups. Per a priori protocol guidelines, the study was stopped owing to futility.
CONCLUSIONS: In a randomized controlled study of consecutive patients undergoing ERCP, rectal indomethacin did not prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional.
SETTING: Community-based study.
PARTICIPANTS: Sample included 125 Alzheimer caregivers and 60 demographically similar older adults with nondemented spouses (i.e., noncaregivers).
MEASUREMENTS: We compared caregivers and noncaregivers on stress, coping, and mood outcomes. We also examined antidepressant use within the caregiver sample. An emphasis was placed upon effect size differences, including Cohen's d as well as more clinically meaningful effect sizes.
RESULTS: Caregivers were significantly more likely to endorse depressive symptoms and to meet clinically significant cutoff for depression (40% for caregivers; 5% for noncaregivers). Approximately 25% of caregivers reported taking antidepressant medication, although 69% of these continued to experience significant symptoms of depression. Caregivers also utilized fewer positive coping and greater negative coping strategies than noncaregivers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Urine PCA3 scores were determined before year 2 and year 4 biopsies from patients in the placebo arm of the REDUCE trial, a prostate cancer risk reduction study evaluating men with moderately increased serum prostate specific antigen results and negative biopsy at baseline. PCA3, serum prostate specific antigen and percent free prostate specific antigen results were correlated with biopsy outcome via univariate logistic regression and ROC analyses. Multivariate logistic regression was also performed including these biomarkers together with prostate volume, age and family history.
RESULTS: PCA3 scores were measurable from 1,072 of 1,140 subjects (94% informative rate). PCA3 scores were associated with positive biopsy rate (p <0.0001) and correlated with biopsy Gleason score (p = 0.0017). PCA3 AUC of 0.693 was greater than serum prostate specific antigen (0.612, p = 0.0077 vs PCA3). The multivariate logistic regression model yielded an AUC of 0.753 and exclusion of PCA3 from the model decreased AUC to 0.717 (p = 0.0009).

Currently licensed pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) confer protection against PD caused by most vaccine serotypes, but non-vaccine serotypes contribute to residual disease. V114 is a 15-valent PCV containing all 13 serotypes in Prevnar 13™ (PCV13) and additional serotypes 22F and 33F. This pivotal phase 3 study compared safety and immunogenicity of V114 and PCV13.
METHODS: 1720 healthy infants were randomized 1:1 to receive a 4-dose regimen of V114 or PCV13 concomitantly with other routine pediatric vaccines. Safety was evaluated after each dose as proportion of participants with adverse events (AEs). Serotype-specific anti-pneumococcal immunoglobulin G (IgG) was measured at 1-month post-dose 3 (PD3), pre-dose 4, and 1-month post-dose 4 (PD4). IgG response rates, geometric mean concentrations (GMCs), and opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) were compared between vaccination groups.
RESULTS: The proportion, maximum intensity, and duration of injection-site, systemic, and serious AEs were generally comparable between V114 and PCV13 groups. In comparison to PCV13, V114 met non-inferiority criteria for all 15 serotypes based on IgG response rates at PD3. V114 met non-inferiority criteria by IgG GMCs for all serotypes at PD3 and PD4, except for serotype 6A at PD3. V114-induced antibodies had bactericidal activity as assessed by OPA. Further, V114 met superiority criteria for shared serotype 3 and unique serotypes 22F and 33F compared to PCV13 by serotype-specific IgG GMCs at both PD3 and PD4. Immunogenicity of concomitantly administered routine pediatric vaccines was comparable in V114 and PCV13 groups.
CONCLUSIONS: In healthy infants, V114 displays acceptable safety and tolerability profiles and generates comparable immune responses to PCV13. V114 also met superiority criteria for serotypes 3, 22F, and 33F. These results support use of V114 for prevention of PD as part of routine infant vaccination schedules.

Although guidelines recommend measuring it as a diagnostic tool for asthma, the usefulness of this approach has not been studied in children.
AIM: To assess the usefulness of home spirometry in children with nonspecific lower respiratory tract symptoms, to diagnose or exclude asthma.
METHODS: In school-aged children, referred by their general practitioner because of chronic respiratory symptoms of unknown origin, the diagnosis of asthma was made or excluded by a pediatric pulmonologist (gold standard), based on international guidelines and a standardized protocol. Additionally, children measured peak expiratory flow (PEF) and forced expiratory flow in 1 sec (FEV(1)) twice daily for 2 weeks on a home spirometer, from which diurnal variation was calculated. These results (index test) were not revealed to the pediatric pulmonologist. The value of home spirometry to diagnose asthma was calculated.
RESULTS: Sixty-one children (27 boys) were included (mean age: 10.4 years; range: 6-16 years). Between asthma and no asthma, the mean difference in PEF variation was 4.4% (95% CI: 0.9-7.9; P = 0.016) and in FEV(1) variation 4.5% (95% CI: 1.6-7.4; P = 0.003).

According to the 'surviving sepsis campaign,' diagnosis of sepsis and infection is urgent; early and specific treatment is most effective to reduce complications and to decrease mortality.
RECENT FINDINGS: A variety of biomarkers of sepsis is presently available. The diagnostic spectrum of the various markers, however, is different. Some primarily indicate severity of inflammation (e.g. interleukin-6), others respond to infection, but do not indicate the host response well (endotoxin, lipoprotein binding protein, triggering receptor on myeloid cells). There are new markers with limited clinical experience, for example triggering receptor on myeloid cells or mid-pro atrial natriuretic peptide (Seristra, Brahms AG, Hennigsdorf, Germany). Procalcitonin is a well-established biomarker of sepsis that fulfills several criteria of clinical needs: it responds both to infection and severity of inflammation and thus has an impact on therapy. Recent studies indicate that antibiotic treatment can also be guided by procalcitonin. Further indications, including diagnosis of invasive bacterial infections and diagnosis of sepsis in neonates and children have been reported recently.
SUMMARY: Recent data and cumulative analyses indicate that biomarkers of sepsis improve diagnosis of sepsis. However, only a few markers have impact on therapy and fulfill the clinical requirements.

At 12 months, the mean change in C-peptide area under curve was -229 pmol/L (95% CI -316 to -142) for the treatment group and -253 pmol/L (-383 to -123) for the placebo group; this difference was not significant (p=0·77). No adverse or serious adverse events were probably or definitely related to the study treatment.
INTERPRETATION: Although the expected change in the primary endpoint was not achieved, not all participants had increases in glucagon-like peptide-1 and gastrin concentrations that were expected with treatment. Although participants did not have adverse events related to study drugs, the study is not powered to address safety definitively. Further trials including these drugs might be warranted, but should be designed to ensure appropriate selection of participants and increases in these intermediary hormones.

METHODS: Data were analyzed for 134 adults 60 years or older with insomnia and apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of less than 15 who were randomized to a larger study of CBTI versus a sleep education control. Sleep outcomes (sleep onset latency, total wake time, wake after sleep onset, sleep efficiency, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) were compared between CBTI and control at 6 months using repeated-measures analysis of variance adjusted for baseline values. AHI of 5 or greater versus less than 5 was included as an interaction term to evaluate changes in sleep outcomes. The number of participants at baseline and 6 months with mild SDB for whom insomnia was their only other indication for PAP was also compared between CBTI and control.
RESULTS: AHI status (AHI ≥ 5 [75.5% of participants] versus AHI < 5) did not moderate improvements in sleep associated with CBTI (all p values ≥ .12). Nine (45.0%) of 20 participants with mild SDB for whom insomnia was their only other indication for PAP therapy at baseline no longer had another indication for PAP at 6 months, with no significant difference between CBTI and control.

METHODS: In a randomised, open-label study, 121 healthy women, 18-50 years of age, were randomly assigned to receive NOMAC/E2 (2.5 mg/1.5 mg) in a 24/4-day regimen (n=60) or LNG/EE (150 μg/30 μg) in a 21/7-day regimen (n=61) for six cycles. The primary outcome was the change from baseline to cycle 6 for all indices.
RESULTS: All parameters were similar at baseline between the two groups. Over six cycles, NOMAC/E2 had less effect on most haemostatic indices than LNG/EE. Lipids were essentially unchanged with NOMAC/E2, whereas with LNG/EE high-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides slightly increased. NOMAC/E2 induced negligible changes in glucose and insulin parameters, in contrast to LNG/EE. A much smaller increase in CRP was observed with NOMAC/E2 than with LNG/EE. NOMAC/E2 was associated with a greater increase in SHBG.

METHODS: A 26-week, multi-country (Canada, Mexico, Romania, South Africa and the USA), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study compared exenatide twice-daily vs. placebo in 165 subjects suboptimally controlled with TZDs with or without metformin [HbA(1c) 8.2% (s.d. 0.9), fasting serum glucose 9.1 (2.6) mmol/l, body weight 93.9 (17.8) kg, diabetes duration 6.4 (4.3) years]. After a 2-week, single-blind, lead-in period, subjects were randomly assigned (2 : 1) to add exenatide or placebo to current regimens. The primary endpoint was HbA(1c) change at endpoint (Week 26 or last-observation-carried-forward).
RESULTS: Only 8 subjects were treated with concomitant TZD alone. Exenatide reduced HbA(1c) significantly more than placebo [-0.84% (s.e. 0.20) vs. -0.10% (0.23), treatment difference -0.74% (0.16), p < 0.001)]. Mean reductions in body weight were similar in both treatments at endpoint [exenatide, -1.4 (s.e. 0.6) kg vs. placebo, -0.8 (0.7) kg, p = 0.176)]. Nearly 71% of subjects had both a reduction in HbA(1c) and body weight with exenatide compared with 54% with placebo. The most common adverse events (exenatide vs. placebo) were nausea (12% vs. 2%, p = 0.037), vomiting (8% vs. 0%, p = 0.031) and headache (4% vs. 4%). Confirmed (blood glucose <3.0 mmol/l) minor hypoglycaemia was experienced by 4 and 2% of subjects treated with exenatide and placebo, respectively.

OBJECTIVES: The long-term safety and efficacy of intermittent (28-day ""on""/""off"" cycles) inhaled tobramycin nebulization solution 300 mg/4 ml (TNS4, Bramitob(®)/Bethkis(®)) was assessed over 56 weeks in CF patients aged ≥6 years having baseline 1 sec forced expiratory volume (FEV(1)) 40-80% predicted.
METHODS: Patients were initially randomized in an 8-week open-label trial (core phase) to compare TNS4 (N = 159) and tobramycin 300 mg/5 ml (TNS5, TOBI(®)) (N = 165). A subset of patients continued in a 48-week, single-arm extension receiving TNS4 only. The primary endpoint of the core phase was to demonstrate the non-inferiority of TNS4 compared to TNS5 in terms of absolute change from baseline to week 4 in FEV(1) % predicted. The assessment of long-term safety was the primary purpose of the extension phase. Throughout all phases of the study, microbiological assessments, adverse events, and audiometry findings were also evaluated.
RESULTS: In the core phase (N = 321), FEV(1) (% predicted) increased from baseline (absolute change) following a single on-treatment cycle for both TNS4 (7.0%) and TNS5 (7.5%) and the non-inferiority between treatments was met [difference between treatments of -0.5 (95% CI: -2.6; 1.6)]. These improvements were maintained throughout the extension phase (N = 209), ranging throughout the study between 5.1% (95% CI: 3.2; 6.9) and 8.1% (95% CI: 6.8; 9.4) compared to baseline. Pa sputum count reductions ranged between 0.6 (95% CI: 0.2; 0.9) to 2.3 (95% CI: 2.0; 2.6) log10 CFU/g throughout the 56 weeks. No remarkable safety issues were identified throughout both study phases, with similar percentages of patients reporting adverse events in the two treatment groups during the 8-week core phase [TNS4 (31.4%); TNS5 (28.0%)].

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In total, 239 patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to treatment with lenalidomide (n = 160) or placebo (n = 79) once per day (on 28-day cycles). The primary end point was the rate of RBC transfusion independence (TI) ≥ 8 weeks. Secondary end points were RBC-TI ≥ 24 weeks, duration of RBC-TI, erythroid response, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and safety.
RESULTS: RBC-TI ≥ 8 weeks was achieved in 26.9% and 2.5% of patients in the lenalidomide and placebo groups, respectively (P < .001). Ninety percent of patients achieving RBC-TI responded within 16 weeks of treatment. Median duration of RBC-TI with lenalidomide was 30.9 weeks (95% CI, 20.7 to 59.1). Transfusion reduction of ≥ 4 units packed RBCs, on the basis of a 112-day assessment, was 21.8% in the lenalidomide group and 0% in the placebo group. Higher response rates were observed in patients with lower baseline endogenous erythropoietin ≤ 500 mU/mL (34.0% v 15.5% for > 500 mU/mL). At week 12, mean changes in HRQoL scores from baseline did not differ significantly between treatment groups, which suggests that lenalidomide did not adversely affect HRQoL. Achievement of RBC-TI ≥ 8 weeks was associated with significant improvements in HRQoL (P < .01). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.
CONCLUSION: Lenalidomide yields sustained RBC-TI in 26.9% of RBC transfusion-dependent patients with lower-risk non-del(5q) myelodysplastic syndromes ineligible for or refractory to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents.

The present study quantified net joint torques of the lower limbs and trunk in the sagittal and frontal planes following multi-directional surface translations. Twenty-one healthy subjects stood with feet on separate force plates mounted on a moveable platform, translated unexpectedly in one of 12 directions. Peak net torque magnitudes and latencies following perturbation onset were determined as were the relative contributions of each joint to total torque production. Magnitude of net torque generated by each leg varied by perturbation direction, with the largest individual joint magnitude elicited in directions of limb loading. Relative contributions of individual joint torques to the total response were dependent upon perturbation direction. Results suggest that a redistribution of the relative contributions of hip/trunk versus ankle strategies occurs dependent on perturbation direction, with a significant contribution by the knee joint in response to forward perturbations. Direction-specific redistribution of proximal versus distal strategies appears to depend upon the biomechanical constraints imposed by a given perturbation direction. Thus, it appears that sagittal and frontal plane posture-righting responses may not be uniquely controlled, and may instead be governed similarly, with modulation of relative torque contributions among joints when necessary, given direction-specific anatomical constraints.",2,PRIMARY,Change From Baseline to 6 Months in Numeric Pain Rating Scale (0-10 Points),Current Pain Scale 0-10 Lower score is better/improved; Negative value indicates improvement,Stabilization,Strengthening and Conditioning,"Stabilization exercise protocol: The stabilization exercise protocol consists of exercises focused on improving the ability of trunk muscles to stabilize the spine, beginning with training to isolate the deeper abdominal muscles as well as deep dorsal trunk muscles. Then patients were progressed to exercises that added leverage of the limbs while maintaining the co-contraction of the deeper abdominal muscles and deep dorsal trunk muscles while breathing normally. Various positions (e.g., supine and quadruped positions) were used to challenge the patients based on their tolerance. Finally, patients were progressed to exercises in more functional positions that included tasks/activities that were reported as challenging and/or painful; patients performed the tasks at the speed demanded by the particular task. Maintenance of the co-contraction of deep trunk muscles was emphasized during these functional activities.","Strength and conditioning exercise protocol: This protocol contained trunk strengthening and endurance exercises. It consisted of 3 phases: 1) initial strengthening of trunk flexors/extensors in single plane movements, 2) trunk and lower-extremity stretching as well as progression of trunk-strengthening exercises to include multi-planar trunk movements. Aerobic exercises were progressed as tolerated and patient education about body biomechanics were reinforced, and 3) trunk-strengthening exercises under dynamic conditions (e.g., unstable support surface and in multi-planar trunk movements). During the 10 week protocol, exercises became more challenging, and each subject had to complete at least the first phase before moving onto the next phase in order to be included in post-testing analyses.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Analysis of a nationally representative sample of visits to office-based physicians conducted between 1993 and 2002 (N = 251,905). Visits were grouped into 3 discrete time periods, 1993-1996, 1997-1999 and 2000-2002.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rate of diagnosis, type of mental health visit, type of treatment received (medication or psychotherapy), rate of psychotropic medications prescription, and specialty of the treating physician.
RESULTS: From 1993-1996 to 2000-2002, the proportion of office visits in which mental health care was provided decreased for Hispanics from 12.2% to 11.7% while it increased from 13.1% to 15.7% for non-Hispanics (P < 0.05). Visits with a diagnosis of mental disorder decreased from 5.2% to 5.1% in Hispanics but increased from 6.0% to 8.8% in non-Hispanics (P < 0.05). Visits resulting in prescription of a psychotropic medication decreased from 10.2% to 9.3% in Hispanics, while they increased from 10.2% to 12.5% in non-Hispanics (P < 0.05). Psychotherapy visits decreased from 2.4% to 1.3% in Hispanics (P < 0.05), whereas they remained constant (2.5%) in non-Hispanics. Visits to a psychiatrist decreased from 2.5% to 1.3% in Hispanics (P < 0.05), while they increased (nonsignificantly) from 3.1% to 3.5% for non-Hispanics. Most differences persisted after adjusting for age and insurance status.
CONCLUSIONS: From 1993 to 2002, there was an increase in mental health care disparities between Hispanics and non-Hispanics treated by office-based physicians.

METHODS: We re-determined the skin microcirculation of 72 patients (ICT 35 vs ST 37) from the original Stockholm Diabetes Intervention Study with iontophoresis topically applied with the following vasoactive stimuli: acetylcholine (ACh) (endothelial-dependent vasodilatation), sodium nitroprusside (SNP) (endothelial-independent vasodilatation), and capsaicin (C-nociceptive-dependent vasodilatation). HbA1c levels (mean of 14 values/patient) were prospectively collected between 1990 and 1995 and tested for association with skin microcirculation.

Stimulated blood flow was higher in the ICT vs ST group with significantly increased perfusion units (PU) for: ACh (8.1 PU [4.6-24.7 PU] vs 5.3 PU [1.7-21.4 PU], p < 0.01); SNP (8.1 PU [2.2-20.1 PU] vs 5.6 PU [2.3-19.2 PU], p = 0.03); and capsaicin (5.0 PU [1.7-22.9 PU] vs 3.4 PU [1.5-8.4 PU], p < 0.01). HbA1c was associated with vasodilatation induced by ACh (b = -0.02, p < 0.01) and capsaicin (b = -0.02, p = 0.03). HbA1c was independently associated with ACh (b = -1.48, p < 0.01) and capsaicin-induced vasodilatation (b = -1.45, p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Improved glycaemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes is associated with an improvement in skin microcirculation and with a lower incidence of ischaemic foot ulcers.

Despite positive trends in survivorship, a cancer diagnosis can trigger accelerated functional decline that can threaten independence, reduce quality-of-life and increase healthcare costs, especially among the elderly who comprise the majority of survivors. Lifestyle interventions may hold promise in reorienting functional decline in older cancer survivors, but few studies have been conducted.
METHODS: We describe the design and methods of a randomized controlled trial, RENEW (Reach out to ENhancE Wellness), that tests whether a home-based multi-behavior intervention focused on exercise, and including a low saturated fat, plant-based diet, would improve physical functioning among 641 older, long-term (>or=5 years post-diagnosis) survivors of breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer. Challenges to recruitment are examined.
RESULTS: Twenty thousand and fifteen cases were approached, and screened using a two-step screening process to assure eligibility. This population of long-term, elderly cancer survivors had lower rates of response (approximately 11%) and higher rates of ineligibility (approximately 70%) than our previous intervention studies conducted on adults with newly diagnosed cancer. Significantly higher response rates were noted among survivors who were White, younger, and more proximal to diagnosis and breast cancer survivors (p-values<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Older cancer survivors represent a vulnerable population for whom lifestyle interventions may hold promise. RENEW may provide guidance in allocating limited resources in order to maximize recruitment efforts aimed at this needy, but hard-to-reach population.",2,PRIMARY,Rapid Gait Speed,No Description Available,Arm 1,Arm 2,"Multi-component physical activity counseling program: A one-year high intensity physical activity counseling program with the following five components: (1) a baseline face-to-face counseling session by the health counselor, (2) follow-up telephone calls by the health counselor biweekly for 6 weekly and then monthly, (3) a one-time physician endorsement of the prescribed exercise regimen in a primary care clinic visit, (4) monthly automated tailored telephone calls from the primary care provider encouraging continued physical activity, and (5) quarterly mailed materials providing personalized feedback",Usual care,BEHAVIORAL,,EXPERIMENTAL,NO_INTERVENTION,['0.04'],['Mixed Models Analysis'],['Superiority or Other'],2009-Apr-N/A
10281,NCT01686750,Integrated Care Centers is superior to Standard Services in terms of Proportion Reporting HIV Testing in the Prior 12 Months 2 years,30952565,"Integrated HIV testing, prevention, and treatment intervention for key populations in India: a cluster-randomised trial.","BACKGROUND: To achieve reductions in HIV incidence, we need strategies to engage key population at risk for HIV in low-income and middle-income countries. We evaluated the effectiveness of integrated care centres in India that provided single-venue HIV testing, prevention, and treatment services for people who inject drugs (PWID) and men who have sex with men (MSM).
METHODS: We did baseline respondent-driven sampling surveys in 27 sites across India, and selected 22 of these (12 PWID and ten MSM) for a cluster randomised trial on the basis of high HIV prevalence and logistical considerations. We used stratified (by PWID and MSM), restricted randomisation to allocate sites to either the integrated care intervention or usual care (11 sites per group). We implemented integrated care centres in 11 cities (six PWID integrated care centres embedded within opioid agonist treatment centres and five MSM centres within government-sponsored health services), with a single integrated care centre per city in all but one city. After a 2-year intervention phase, we did respondent-driven sampling evaluation surveys of target population members who were aged 18 years or older at all sites. The primary outcome was self-reported HIV testing in the previous 12 months (recent testing), determined via the evaluation survey. We used a biometric identification system to estimate integrated care centre exposure (visited an integrated care centre at least once) among evaluation survey participants at intervention sites. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01686750.
FINDINGS: Between Oct 1, 2012, and Dec 19, 2013, we recruited 11 993 PWID and 9997 MSM in the baseline survey and, between Aug, 1 2016, and May 27, 2017, surveyed 11 721 PWID and 10 005 MSM in the evaluation survey using respondent-driven sampling, across the 22 trial sites. During the intervention phase, integrated care centres provided HIV testing for 14 698 unique clients (7630 PWID and 7068 MSM. In the primary population-level analysis, recent HIV testing was 31% higher at integrated care centres than at usual care sites (adjusted prevalence ratio [PR] 1·31, 95% CI 0·95-1·81, p=0·09). Among survey participants at intervention sites, integrated care centre exposure was lower than expected (median exposure 40% at PWID sites and 24% at MSM sites). In intervention sites, survey participants who visited an integrated care centre were more likely to report recent HIV testing than were participants who had not (adjusted PR 3·46, 2·94-4·06).
INTERPRETATION: Although integrated care centres increased HIV testing among visitors, our low exposure findings suggest that the scale-up of a single integrated care centre in most cities was insufficient to serve the large PWID and MSM populations. Future work should address the use of population size estimates to guide the dose of combination HIV interventions targeting key populations.

Improving health outcomes and reducing costs will depend on whether employees sustain lifestyle changes and maintain a healthy weight over time.
PURPOSE: To determine if a 9-month maintenance intervention immediately following a 10-week worksite exercise and nutrition program would prevent regain of the weight lost during the program.
DESIGN: RCT.
SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: In 2008, a total of 330 employees from 24 teams completed a 10-week exercise and nutrition program at a large hospital worksite and were randomized by team to maintenance or control (usual care) for 9 months.
INTERVENTION: Internet support with a website for goal-setting and self-monitoring of weight and exercise plus minimal personal support.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Weight loss, percentage weight loss, time spent in physical activity, and frequency of consumption of fruits/vegetables, fatty foods, and sugary foods at 1 year compared to baseline. One-year follow-up was completed in 2010, and data were analyzed in 2011.
RESULTS: At 1 year, 238 subjects (72%) completed follow-up assessments. Mean baseline BMI was 27.6 and did not differ between intervention and control. Compared to baseline, both groups lost weight during the 10-week program and maintained 65% of weight loss at 1 year (p<0.001). There was no difference in weight loss between groups at the end of the 10-week program (4.8 lbs vs 4.3 lbs, p=0.53 for group X time interaction) or end of maintenance at 1 year (3.4 lbs vs 2.5 lbs, p=0.40 for group X time interaction). All subjects had improvements in physical activity and nutrition (increased fruits/vegetables and decreased fat and sugar intake) at 1 year but did not differ by group.
CONCLUSIONS: An intensive 10-week team-based worksite exercise and nutrition program resulted in moderate weight loss and improvements in diet and exercise behaviors at 1 year, but an Internet-based maintenance program immediately following the 10-week program did not improve these outcomes.

However, most of the literature involves penetrating colon injuries. There are few reports describing complications following penetrating stomach and small bowel injuries. Based on the hypothesis that SSIs are commonly found following penetrating stomach and small bowel trauma, a prospective observational study was performed at an academic Level I trauma center from March 1, 2004 until August 31, 2006. The subjects were patients who had sustained a penetrating injury to the stomach or small bowel. Patients were followed for the development of an SSI, defined as wound infection, fascial dehiscence, or intraabdominal abscess. A total of 178 patients were admitted with penetrating stomach or small bowel injuries over the 29-month period. There were 121 (68%) gunshot injuries and 57 (32%) stab wounds. Associated intraabdominal injuries occurred in 74% of patients. Overall, SSIs occurred in 20% of cases. Risk factors for SSI included associated duodenal or colon injury, whereas time to operating room, blood loss, and type and duration of antibiotic use were not.

Several options for preventing PPH are available, but further advances in this field are important, especially the identification of safe, easy to use and cost-effective regimens. Tranexamic acid (TA), which is an antifibrinolytic agent that is used widely to prevent and treat haemorrhage, merits evaluation to assess whether it meets these criteria.
OBJECTIVES: To determine, from the best available evidence, whether TA is effective and safe for preventing PPH in comparison to placebo or no treatment (with or without uterotonic co-treatment), or to uterotonic agents.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (28 January 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies.
SELECTION CRITERIA: All published, unpublished and ongoing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the use of TA alone or in addition to uterotonics in the third stage of labour or during caesarean section (CS) to prevent PPH.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed for inclusion all the potential studies identified as a result of the search strategy. We entered the data into Review Manager software and checked for accuracy.
MAIN RESULTS: Twelve trials involving 3285 healthy women at low risk of excessive bleeding undergoing elective CS (nine trials, 2453 participants) or spontaneous birth (three trials, 832 participants) satisfied inclusion criteria and contributed data to the analysis. All participants received routine prophylactic uterotonics in accordance with the local guideline in addition to TA or placebo or no intervention. Overall, included studies had moderate risk of bias for random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, selective reporting and low risk of bias for incomplete data. The quality of evidence was also as assessed using GRADE.Blood loss greater than 400 mL or 500 mL, and more than 1000 mL was less common in women who received TA versus placebo or no intervention (risk ratio (RR) 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42 to 0.63, six trials, 1398 women; moderate quality evidence) and (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.71, six trials, 2093 women; moderate quality evidence), respectively. TA was effective in decreasing the incidence of blood loss greater than 1000 mL in women who had undergone CS (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.23, 0.78, four trials, 1534 women), but not vaginal birth (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.06, 1.36, two trials 559 women). The effect of TA on blood loss greater than 500 mL or 400 mL was more pronounced in the group of women having vaginal birth than in women who had CS. Mean blood loss (from delivery until two hours postpartum) was lower in women who received TA versus placebo or no intervention (mean difference MD - 77.79 mL, 95% CI -97.95, -57.64, five trials, 1186 women) and this effect was similar following vaginal birth and CS.Additional medical interventions (moderate quality evidence) and blood transfusions were less frequent in women receiving TA versus placebo or no interventions. Mild side effects such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness were more common with the use of TA (moderate quality evidence). The effect of TA on maternal mortality, severe morbidity and thromboembolic events is uncertain (low quality evidence).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: TA (in addition to uterotonic medications) decreases postpartum blood loss and prevents PPH and blood transfusions following vaginal birth and CS in women at low risk of PPH based on studies of mixed quality. There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about serious side effects, but there is an increase in the incidence of minor side effects with the use of TA. Effects of TA on thromboembolic events and mortality as well as its use in high-risk women should be investigated further.",2,PRIMARY,Number of Participants With Maternal Death or Transfusion of Packed Red Blood Cells,"Participants were monitored from delivery until hospital discharge or 7 days after delivery (postpartum), whichever is sooner.

GOAL: This study assessed the impact of technically improved periodic STD services on STD prevalence and on consistent condom use (CCU).
STUDY DESIGN: The study involved monthly follow-up of 917 FSWs at two STD clinics, with evaluations before and during implementation of strengthened STD services, which included periodic screening and treatment for gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, trichomoniasis, bacterial vaginosis (BV), and syphilis; counseling; and supply of condoms. Outcome analyses were adjusted for participation bias.
RESULTS: During 7908 person-months of observation, the prevalences of gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, trichomoniasis, and BV declined significantly and CCU increased significantly, with similar trends in both clinics.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A prospective, controlled observational study design was used. Mothers who contacted the Beilinson Teratology Information Service (BELTIS) regarding use of tranexamic acid while breastfeeding were followed up by phone interview. Data on lactation, neonatal symptoms, and outcomes at the age of 1-3 years were obtained. Mothers' breastfeeding while taking tranexamic acid and their infants were compared with those of a matched control group of breastfeeding mothers using a drug known to be safe during lactation (amoxicillin) and their infants.
RESULTS: Follow-up was obtained for 28 of 32 women who sought advice regarding use of tranexamic acid during breastfeeding. Of the 28 women, six did not take the drug, and one refused to participate.

Diary-rated sleep efficiency and wake after sleep onset, and daytime ratings of General Fatigue on the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory improved more in the CBTI-AD compared to the BPT group. In addition, more subjects were classified as treatment responders following CBTI-AD. No group differences were found in the number of participants who relapsed to any drinking or who relapsed to heavy drinking.

This single-center, randomized, vehicle-controlled, double-blind, phase II study was designed to ensure the safety of multiple intra-articular injections of LMWF-5A and to explore its efficacy in reducing pain as a result of knee osteoarthritis. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive 3 biweekly intra-articular knee injections of either 4 mL LMWF-5A or vehicle control (saline), administered at weeks 0 (baseline), 2, and 4. Safety was examined as the incidence and severity of adverse events. Efficacy was assessed by the mean (SD) change between treatment groups in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain score from baseline to week 20. A total of 40 patients were randomized and received treatment. No drug-related serious adverse events and no deaths were reported. Adverse events were similar in patients who received saline (18, 90%) and LMWF-5A (19, 95%).

In a randomized, phase 3 trial of 1,776 patients with metastases from solid tumors (except breast or prostate) or multiple myeloma, denosumab was non-inferior to zoledronic acid (ZA) in delaying or preventing SREs. This ad hoc analysis reports outcomes in the subgroup of 1,597 patients with solid tumors, excluding patients with multiple myeloma.
METHODS: Patients received monthly subcutaneous denosumab 120 mg or intravenous ZA 4 mg, adjusted for creatinine clearance, with calcium and vitamin D supplementation recommended. Endpoints included times to first on-study SRE, first-and-subsequent SREs, and pain worsening.
RESULTS: Denosumab significantly delayed time to first on-study SRE compared with ZA (HR, 0.81; 95 % CI, 0.68-0.96) and time to first-and-subsequent SREs (RR, 0.85; 95 % CI, 0.72-1.00). Denosumab also significantly delayed time to development of moderate or severe pain (HR, 0.81; 95 % CI, 0.66-1.00), pain worsening (HR, 0.83; 95 % CI, 0.71-0.97), and worsening pain interference in patients with no/mild baseline pain (HR, 0.77; 95 % CI, 0.61-0.96).

BACKGROUND: Simvastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, reduced cardiovascular events in patients with myocardial infarction and hypercholesterolemia.
METHODS: Sixteen patients with polygenic hypercholesterolemia were randomly allocated to diet (n = 8) or diet plus 20 mg/day simvastatin (n = 8) for eight weeks. Before and at the end of treatment period, lipid profile and monocyte expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) were measured.
RESULTS: At baseline no difference in lipid profile and monocyte expression of TNF and IL-1beta were observed between the two groups. In patients allocated to diet alone, no change in lipid profile and monocyte expression of TNF and IL-1beta was seen. In patients with diet plus simvastatin, significant decreases of total cholesterol (-27%, p<0.02), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (-33%, p<0.02), and monocyte expression of TNF (-49%, p<0.02) and IL-1beta (-35%, p<0.02) were observed. At the end of treatment period, patients treated with simvastatin had lower cholesterol and monocyte TNF and IL-1beta than did patients assigned to diet alone.

We aimed to assess two dose fractionation schedules in patients with painful bone metastases needing repeat radiation therapy.
METHODS: We did a multicentre, non-blinded, randomised, controlled trial in nine countries worldwide. We enrolled patients 18 years or older who had radiologically confirmed, painful (ie, pain measured as ≥2 points using the Brief Pain Inventory) bone metastases, had received previous radiation therapy, and were taking a stable dose and schedule of pain-relieving drugs (if prescribed). Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either 8 Gy in a single fraction or 20 Gy in multiple fractions by a central computer-generated allocation sequence using dynamic minimisation to conceal assignment, stratified by previous radiation fraction schedule, response to initial radiation, and treatment centre. Patients, caregivers, and investigators were not masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was overall pain response at 2 months, which was defined as the sum of complete and partial pain responses to treatment, assessed using both Brief Pain Inventory scores and changes in analgesic consumption. Analysis was done by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00080912.
FINDINGS: Between Jan 7, 2004, and May 24, 2012, we randomly assigned 425 patients to each treatment group. 19 (4%) patients in the 8 Gy group and 12 (3%) in the 20 Gy group were found to be ineligible after randomisation, and 140 (33%) and 132 (31%) patients, respectively, were not assessable at 2 months and were counted as missing data in the intention-to-treat analysis. In the intention-to-treat population, 118 (28%) patients allocated to 8 Gy treatment and 135 (32%) allocated to 20 Gy treatment had an overall pain response to treatment (p=0·21; response difference of 4·00% [upper limit of the 95% CI 9·2, less than the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 10%]). In the per-protocol population, 116 (45%) of 258 patients and 134 (51%) of 263 patients, respectively, had an overall pain response to treatment (p=0·17; response difference 6·00% [upper limit of the 95% CI 13·2, greater than the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 10%]). The most frequently reported acute radiation-related toxicities at 14 days were lack of appetite (201 [56%] of 358 assessable patients who received 8 Gy vs 229 [66%] of 349 assessable patients who received 20 Gy; p=0·011) and diarrhoea (81 [23%] of 357 vs 108 [31%] of 349; p=0·018). Pathological fractures occurred in 30 (7%) of 425 patients assigned to 8 Gy and 20 (5%) of 425 assigned to 20 Gy (odds ratio [OR] 1·54, 95% CI 0·85-2·75; p=0·15), and spinal cord or cauda equina compressions were reported in seven (2%) of 425 versus two (<1%) of 425, respectively (OR 3·54, 95% CI 0·73-17·15; p=0·094).
INTERPRETATION: In patients with painful bone metastases requiring repeat radiation therapy, treatment with 8 Gy in a single fraction seems to be non-inferior and less toxic than 20 Gy in multiple fractions; however, as findings were not robust in a per-protocol analysis, trade-offs between efficacy and toxicity might exist.

A meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Antifibrinolytic agents have been shown to decrease the blood loss associated with major orthopaedic surgical procedures. Spine surgery, particularly procedures performed for deformity correction and procedures involving long arthrodesis constructs, can be associated with a large amount of blood loss requiring blood transfusions. The purpose of the present study was to determine if antifibrinolytic agents reduced blood transfusions in patients managed with spine surgery and to see if one agent had a greater effect than another.
METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the available literature were performed to investigate the efficacy of aprotinin, tranexamic acid, and epsilon-aminocaproic acid in terms of reducing blood loss and blood transfusions in patients undergoing spine surgery. This meta-analysis was focused on the role of these agents in major spine operations as reported in eighteen clinical trials that included information on the drug dosage, the age of the patient, blood loss, blood transfusions, surgery complexity, and complications.
RESULTS: Compared with control groups, the treatment groups for all three antifibrinolytic agents maintained lower levels of total blood loss and transfusions associated with spine surgery. The effect size (d) of the differences in total blood loss between the treatment and control groups ranged from -0.668 (95% confidence interval, -0.971 to -0.365) to -0.936 (95% confidence interval, -1.240 to -0.632) across all three agents. The effect size (d) of the differences in total blood transfusions between the treatment and control groups ranged from -0.466 (95% confidence interval, -0.764 to -0.167) to -0.749 (95% confidence interval, -1.046 to -0.453) across all three agents.
CONCLUSIONS: Aprotinin, tranexamic acid, and epsilon-aminocaproic acid are effective for reducing blood loss and transfusions in patients managed with spine surgery. With the exception of aprotinin, the side-effect profiles of these agents have not been shown to cause any substantial morbidity or to increase the rate of thromboembolic events. Epsilon-aminocaproic acid had a greater effect on reducing blood transfusions as the complexity of surgery increased.

Interventions have been developed to improve community-based ADHD care but have not demonstrated that better care results in improved patient outcomes. The objective of this study was to determine whether an ADHD quality improvement (QI) intervention for community-based pediatric practices improves patient outcomes.
METHODS: A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted in which 50 community-based pediatric primary care practices (213 providers) were randomized either to receive a technology-assisted QI intervention or to a control condition. The intervention consisted of 4 training sessions, office flow modification, guided QI, and an ADHD Internet portal to assist with treatment monitoring.

In this study, it was postulated that radiopharmaceuticals, added to bisphosphonates, could further decrease the incidence of SREs.
METHODS: NRG Oncology RTOG 0517 randomized patients with breast, lung, and prostate cancer and blastic bone metastases to either zoledronic acid (ZA) alone or ZA plus radiopharmaceuticals (Sr-89 or Sm-153). The primary endpoint was time to development of SREs. Secondary objectives included quality of life (QOL), pain control, overall survival (OS), and toxicity.
RESULTS: 261 patients (median age 68; 62% male; 55% prostate, 35% breast, 10% lung) were accrued between July 2006 and February 2011. The study closed early due to a lower than expected rate of SREs. 52 (42%) patients in the ZA arm and 49 (40%) in the radiopharmaceutical arm experienced an SRE. Median time free of SREs was 29.9 and 27.4 months, respectively (p = 0.84). Median OS in the ZA arm and radiopharmaceutical arms was 32.1 and 26.9 months, respectively (p = 0.37). Cox proportional hazards regression model showed that primary disease site (lung) and number of bone metastases (> 2) had a negative impact on OS (p < 0.0001, p = 0.01, respectively). The addition of radiopharmaceuticals to ZA led to a significant reduction in pain at 1 month based on BPI worst score (p = 0.02). No other group differences were noted for QOL or toxicity.
CONCLUSION: The addition of radiopharmaceuticals to bisphosphonates did not alter time to SREs or OS for patients with breast, lung, prostate cancers and blastic bone metastases, although it was associated with significant pain reduction at 1 month.

We compared PCC and FFP intraoperative administration in patients undergoing heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).
METHODS: Forty patients [with international normalized ratio (INR)≥ 2·1] assigned semi-urgent cardiac surgery were randomized to receive either FFP (n = 20) or PCC (n = 20). Prior to CPB, they received either 2 units of FFP or half of the PCC dose calculated according to body weight, initial INR and target INR ( ≤ 1·5). After CPB and protamine administration, patients received either another 2 units of FFP or the other half PCC dose. Additional doses were administered if INR was still too high ( ≥ 1·5).
RESULTS: Fifteen minutes after CPB, more patients reached INR target with PCC (P = 0·007): 7/16 patients vs. 0/15 patients with FFP; there was no difference 1 h after CPB (6/15 patients with PCC vs. 4/15 patients with FFP reached target). Fifteen minutes after CPB, median INR (range) decreased to 1·6 (1·2-2·2) with PCC vs. 2·3 (1·5-3·5) with FFP; 1 h after CPB both groups reached similar values [1·6 (1·3-2·2) with PCC and 1·7 (1·3-2·7) with FFP]. With PCC, less patients needed additional dose (6/20) than with FFP (20/20) (P < 0·001). Both groups differed significantly on the course of factor II (P = 0·0023) and factor X (P = 0·008) over time.

Palifermin reduces mucositis when given in multiple doses to patients undergoing hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of palifermin given as a single dose before each cycle in patients receiving multicycle chemotherapy.
DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00267046)
SETTING: The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.
PATIENTS: 48 patients with sarcoma were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive palifermin or placebo. All patients received doxorubicin-based chemotherapy (90 mg per m(2) of body surface area over 3 days, by infusion).
INTERVENTION: Palifermin (180 µg per kg of body weight) or placebo was administered intravenously as a single dose 3 days before each chemotherapy cycle (maximum, 6 cycles). Patients who had severe mucositis received open-label palifermin in subsequent cycles.
MEASUREMENTS: Oral assessment of mucositis by using World Health Organization (WHO) oral toxicity scale (grades 0 to 4), with moderate to severe mucositis (grades 2 to 4) as the main outcomes; patient-reported outcome questionnaire; and daily symptom record diary.
RESULTS: A median of 6 blinded cycles (range, 1 to 6) were completed by the palifermin group and 2 (range, 1 to 6) by the placebo group. Compared with placebo, palifermin reduced the cumulative incidence of moderate to severe (grade 2 or higher) mucositis (44% vs. 88%; P < 0.001; difference, -44 percentage points [95% CI, -71 to -16 percentage points) and severe (grade 3 or 4) mucositis (13% vs. 51%; P = 0.002; difference, -38 percentage points [CI, -67 to -9 percentage points]). The main adverse effects were thickening of oral mucosa (72% in the palifermin group vs. 31% in the placebo group; P = 0.007) and altered taste. Seven of the 8 patients who had severe mucositis in the placebo group received open-label palifermin. None of these patients had severe mucositis in the subsequent cycles (a total of 17) with open-label palifermin.
LIMITATIONS: Study limitations include smaller sample size for the control group, inclusion of only patients with sarcoma, and perceived unblinding of the treatment because of notable differences between the biologic effects of palifermin and placebo.

We report the results of OPUS-2, a phase III study evaluating the efficacy and safety of lifitegrast compared with placebo for the treatment of DED.
DESIGN: A 12-week, multicenter, randomized, prospective, double-masked, placebo-controlled clinical trial.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged ≥18 years with use of artificial tears within 30 days, inferior corneal staining score ≥0.5 (0-4 scale), Schirmer tear test (without anesthesia) ≥1 and ≤10 mm, and eye dryness score ≥40 (0-100 visual analogue scale [VAS]).
METHODS: Subjects were randomized 1:1 after 14-day placebo run-in to lifitegrast ophthalmic solution 5.0% or placebo twice daily for 84 days.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Co-primary efficacy end points were change, from baseline to day 84, in eye dryness score (VAS, both eyes) and inferior corneal fluorescein staining score in the designated study eye. Secondary end points were change, from baseline to day 84, in ocular discomfort score (0-4 scale) in study eye, eye discomfort score (VAS), total corneal staining score in the study eye, and nasal conjunctival lissamine green staining score (0-4 scale) in the study eye. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were recorded.
RESULTS: A total of 718 subjects were randomized: placebo, n = 360; lifitegrast, n = 358 (intent-to-treat population). Lifitegrast-treated subjects experienced greater improvement in eye dryness than placebo-treated subjects (treatment effect, 12.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 8.51-16.70; P < 0.0001). There was no between-group difference in inferior corneal staining (treatment effect, 0.03; 95% CI, -0.10 to 0.17; P = 0.6186). There was nominally significant improvement of secondary symptom end points among lifitegrast-treated subjects: ocular discomfort (nominal P = 0.0005) and eye discomfort (nominal, P < 0.0001). There were no between-group differences on secondary signs: total corneal staining and nasal lissamine staining. More lifitegrast-treated subjects (33.7%) than placebo-treated subjects (16.4%) experienced ocular TEAEs; no ocular TEAEs were serious.
CONCLUSIONS: Lifitegrast met the co-primary symptom end point (eye dryness) but not the co-primary sign end point (inferior corneal staining).

METHODS: Subjects with CIS were enrolled in a phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 14-center randomized trial testing 80 mg atorvastatin on clinical and brain MRI activity. Brain MRIs were performed quarterly. The primary endpoint (PEP) was development of ≥ 3 new T2 lesions, or one clinical relapse within 12 months. Subjects meeting the PEP were offered additional weekly interferon β-1a (IFNβ-1a).
RESULTS: Due to slow recruitment, enrollment was discontinued after 81 of 152 planned subjects with CIS were randomized and initiated study drug. Median (interquartile range) numbers of T2 and gadolinium-enhancing (Gd) lesions were 15.0 (22.0) and 0.0 (0.0) at baseline. A total of 53.1% of atorvastatin recipients (n = 26/49) met PEP compared to 56.3% of placebo recipients (n = 18/32) (p = 0.82). Eleven atorvastatin subjects (22.4%) and 7 placebo subjects (21.9%) met the PEP by clinical criteria. Proportion of subjects who did not develop new T2 lesions up to month 12 or to starting IFNβ-1a was 55.3% in the atorvastatin and 27.6% in the placebo group (p = 0.03). Likelihood of remaining free of new T2 lesions was significantly greater in the atorvastatin group compared with placebo (odds ratio [OR] = 4.34, p = 0.01). Likelihood of remaining free of Gd lesions tended to be higher in the atorvastatin group (OR = 2.72, p = 0.11). Overall, atorvastatin was well tolerated. No clear antagonistic effect of atorvastatin plus IFNβ-1a was observed on MRI measures.
CONCLUSION: Atorvastatin treatment significantly decreased development of new brain MRI T2 lesion activity, although it did not achieve the composite clinical and imaging PEP.

Controlled behavioral assessment studies have not focused on this population. This study compared calorie intake, percentage of Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) per day and per kilogram, and percentage of calories from fat, protein, and carbohydrates between infants and toddlers with CF and healthy peers. Also, eating behaviors, such as meal duration, bites and sips per minute, percentage of meal spent eating, children's problematic eating behaviors, and parents' perceptions of mealtime behaviors were compared between infants and toddlers with CF and controls. Five hypotheses were tested. 1) Infants and toddlers with CF would be comparable to controls on the number of calories consumed per day and the percentage of calories from fat. 2) Infants and toddlers with CF would not meet the CF dietary guidelines for the percentage of RDA for calories or the percentage of calories from fat. 3) Infants and toddlers with CF would have longer meal durations than healthy peers, but would not differ on the pace of eating, the number of calories consumed during the meal, or the percentage of time spent eating during the meal. 4) Parents of infants and toddlers with CF would perceive more problematic mealtime behavior than controls. 5) Parents' perceptions of children's mealtime behavior would positively correlate with meal duration and negatively correlate with the number of calories consumed during the meal.
DESIGN: A 2-group comparison study.
SETTING/SAMPLE: A clinical sample of 35 infants and toddlers with CF (M = 18.6; standard deviation = 8.1 months; range = 7-35 months) and a community sample of 34 healthy peers matched for age, gender, socioeconomic status, and number of parents and siblings present during mealtimes.
MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: Children's calorie intake was measured using 3-day diet diaries. The 2 groups did not differ on the total number of calories consumed per day, the percentage of calories derived from fat, or the percentage of RDA consumed per day. Infants and toddlers with CF were not meeting the CF dietary recommendations of 120% to 150% RDA for energy with 40% of calories coming from fat. Using the Dyadic Interaction Nomenclature for Eating, a behavioral coding system, videotaped recordings of children's dinner meals were scored for meal duration, number of bites and sips per minute, number of calories per bite or sip, and the percentage of 10-second intervals with bites and sips. The CF sample had significantly longer mealtimes (20.2 minutes) than the control group (16.4 minutes), but did not differ on calories consumed at the meal, bites and sips per minute, calories per bite and sip, or time spent eating during the meal. On the Behavioral Pediatrics Feeding Assessment Scale, a measure of parental perceptions of mealtime behavior that was completed by a subset of families (39 families), parents of infants and toddlers with CF endorsed a greater number of mealtime behaviors as problems and a higher occurrence of problems than did parents of controls. Examples of these behaviors for the CF sample included problems with their child's willingness to try new foods (48%), eat vegetables (48%), and observations that their child has a poor appetite (32%) and would rather drink than eat (32%). Parents of children with CF chose a greater number of mealtime strategies and feelings as problems and reported more frequently using problematic strategies at mealtimes than did parents of controls. Examples of problematic strategies and feelings for parents of infants and toddlers with CF included feeling anxious/frustrated when feeding their children (37%), not feeling confident that their child eats enough (32%), and using coaxing to get their child to take a bite (26%). For the entire sample, a positive correlation of 0.29 was found between the number of mealtime behavior problems reported by parents and meal duration, suggesting the co-occurrence of problematic mealtime behavior with longer meal duration. No relationship was found between the number of child mealtime behavior problems reported by parents and the number of calories consumed during the filmed meal. For the CF sample, a correlation of -0.26 between children's weight percentile for age and the filmed meal duration was found, suggesting a tendency for meal duration to increase as children's weight for age decreases. Post-hoc analyses were conducted comparing infants and toddlers with previously reported samples of preschool and school-aged children on meal duration. Results demonstrated that in each group, children with CF had longer meals than age-matched controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal significant deficits in achieving dietary recommendations for many families of infants and toddlers with CF. Only 11% of infants and toddlers with CF met the CF dietary recommendation of at least 120% of the RDA/day for energy. In addition, infants and toddlers were found to derive only 34% of their daily calories from fat, compared with the recommended 40% needed for a moderate to high fat diet. These results underscore the need for intervention in families of infants and toddlers with CF, who in addition to being at increased risk for malnutrition, may also experience a hastening in the decline of their pulmonary status because of poor nutritional status. Currently, there is limited programmatic research on nutritional and feeding interventions for toddlers and infants with CF. One study, which used a hospital-based behavioral education program to increase the caloric intake of 3 children (ages 10-20 months) who were below the fifth percentile for weight for length, found at least a 54% increase in calories for each child after treatment. Similarly, preliminary findings of 2 parent-based interventions, a nutrition education curriculum and a nutrition education plus behavior parent-training curriculum, found a 22% and 32% increase in daily calories, respectively, at treatment completion. A large-scale clinical trial is needed to evaluate the efficacy of any nutritional intervention before widespread dissemination. Additional assessment-focused research is also needed to identify patients' who may be at greatest risk for malnutrition and to guide the development of interventions to treat them.",2,PRIMARY,Change in Energy Intake From Baseline to Post Treatment,"This primary outcome measure compared change in energy intake from baseline to post treatment between the behavioral and nutrition treatment and the education and attention control treatment.

Although evidence suggests that family psychoeducation is cost-effective, many cost-effectiveness analyses have suffered from limitations that reduce their utility in guiding decisions to incorporate this intervention within existing clinical services. These include not presenting results in present-day dollars and not examining whether the intervention would remain cost-effective in situations where the clinical benefits achieved were smaller than those reported in past studies. Thus the goal of this study was to investigate the cost of providing a specific psychoeducation program-multifamily group psychoeducation-to individuals with first-episode psychosis and their families.
METHODS: Statistical simulation was used to estimate the cost and burden of illness associated with usual treatment versus usual treatment plus multifamily group psychoeducation. In addition, the simulation model was rerun to test whether multifamily psychoeducation would remain cost-effective in situations where the clinical benefits achieved were smaller than those reported in past studies.
RESULTS: When provided for two years, multifamily group psychoeducation ranged from a cost-effective to a cost-saving intervention, depending on the clinical benefits achieved by staff delivering the intervention. When provided for longer durations (five, ten, or 20 years), multifamily psychoeducation was a cost-saving intervention even in scenarios where the clinical benefits of the intervention were reduced by 90%.

Because deficient Wnt signaling has been implicated in disorders of reduced bone mass, we tested whether lithium could improve bone mass in mice. We gavage-fed lithium chloride to 8-week-old mice from three different strains (Lrp5(-/-), SAMP6, and C57BL/6) and assessed the effect on bone metabolism after 4 weeks of therapy. Lrp5(-/-) mice lack the Wnt coreceptor low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 and have markedly reduced bone mass. Lithium, which is predicted to act downstream of this receptor, restored bone metabolism and bone mass to near wild-type levels in these mice. SAMP6 mice have accelerated osteoporosis due to inadequate osteoblast renewal. Lithium significantly improved bone mass in these mice and in wild-type C57BL/6 mice. We found that lithium activated canonical Wnt signaling in cultured calvarial osteoblasts from Lrp5(-/-) mice ex vivo and that lithium-treated mice had increased expression of Wnt-responsive genes in their bone marrow cells in vivo. These data lead us to conclude that lithium enhances bone formation and improves bone mass in mice and that it may do so via activation of the canonical Wnt pathway. Lithium has been used safely and effectively for over half a century in the treatment of bipolar illness. Prospective studies in patients receiving lithium should determine whether it also improves bone mass in humans.",2,PRIMARY,pQCT of Lower Leg,"pQCT will be done at baseline for all OPPG participants and unaffecteds.

The randomised, phase III JAVELIN Gastric 300 trial compared avelumab versus physician's choice of chemotherapy as third-line therapy in patients with advanced GC/GEJC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with unresectable, recurrent, locally advanced, or metastatic GC/GEJC were recruited at 147 sites globally. All patients were randomised to receive either avelumab 10 mg/kg by intravenous infusion every 2 weeks or physician's choice of chemotherapy (paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 or irinotecan 150 mg/m2 on days 1 and 15, each of a 4-week treatment cycle); patients ineligible for chemotherapy received best supportive care. The primary end point was overall survival (OS). Secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety.
RESULTS: A total of 371 patients were randomised. The trial did not meet its primary end point of improving OS {median, 4.6 versus 5.0 months; hazard ratio (HR)=1.1 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.9-1.4]; P = 0.81} or the secondary end points of PFS [median, 1.4 versus 2.7 months; HR=1.73 (95% CI 1.4-2.2); P > 0.99] or ORR (2.2% versus 4.3%) in the avelumab versus chemotherapy arms, respectively. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) of any grade occurred in 90 patients (48.9%) and 131 patients (74.0%) in the avelumab and chemotherapy arms, respectively. Grade ≥3 TRAEs occurred in 17 patients (9.2%) in the avelumab arm and in 56 patients (31.6%) in the chemotherapy arm.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of patients with GC/GEJC with single-agent avelumab in the third-line setting did not result in an improvement in OS or PFS compared with chemotherapy. Avelumab showed a more manageable safety profile than chemotherapy.

3147,NCT02557672,Prothrombin Complex Concentrate is superior to Fresh Frozen Plasma in terms of Platelets Blood Product Transfusion 24 hours,17599498,Comparison of early platelet activation in patients undergoing on-pump versus off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery.,"OBJECTIVE: Cardiopulmonary bypass has been shown to be associated with platelet dysfunction, which has a potential for increasing the risk of perioperative bleeding. Off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery is thought to avoid this deleterious effect of pump use on platelets. However, the influence of off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery on platelets has not been thoroughly studied.
METHODS: Accordingly, we evaluated 60 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting prospectively using cardiopulmonary bypass and warm cardioplegic arrest (n = 30) or an off-pump technique (n = 30). Platelet function was evaluated before and 2 hours after coronary artery bypass grafting.
RESULTS: Among patients undergoing on-pump coronary artery bypass surgery, all studies of platelet function were significantly abnormal after surgical intervention compared with results before surgical intervention. Similarly, among patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery, evidence of platelet dysfunction after surgical intervention was noted, with a lower platelet count and a higher proportion of P-selectin- and Annexin V-positive platelets. However, compared with the preprocedural value, the postprocedural decrease in platelet count (78,200 x 10(3)/microL vs 103,000 x 10(3)/microL) and platelet aggregation (0.8% vs 10.9%) and increase in bleeding time (0 minutes vs +1.3 minutes), P-selectin-positive platelets (6.0% vs 9.1%), and Annexin V-positive platelets (1.7% vs 3.7%) were significantly lower in the off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery group compared with those in the on-pump coronary artery bypass surgery group, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Early postoperative decrease in platelet count and increase in platelet activation occurs to a much lesser extent and does not alter bleeding time or adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery. This lack of significant effects on platelets might in part account for the potential decreased risk in bleeding and for the preserved hemostasis seen in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery compared with those undergoing on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting surgery.",2,PRIMARY,Platelets Blood Product Transfusion,"The number of subject's who received 0,1,2,3 or more units of Platelets transfused from completion of study drug administration though midnight of the next day.",Prothrombin Complex Concentrate,Fresh Frozen Plasma,"After cardiopulmonary bypass, patients received protamine at dose 0.01 mg/unit of heparin given with target activated clotting time (ACT) within 10% of baseline value.

Diabetes in particular is of concern because of its increased prevalence among Navajo youth. Gardening can successfully address issues of poor availability of fruits and vegetables and offer many other social and health benefits. Our assessment aimed to determine Navajo attitudes about gardening and health in San Juan County, New Mexico. We conducted seven focus groups (including 31 people) to assess knowledge and attitudes related to gardening and uncover barriers and facilitators to participation in a garden project. Each group session was moderated by two Navajo students. Transcripts revealed that many Navajo are aware of adverse health issues that occur on the reservation, predominantly obesity and diabetes. Participants expressed a preference for educational approaches that incorporated cultural traditions, respect for elders, use of visual aids, and experiential learning. Several social and agronomic barriers to gardening were also mentioned. Results suggested a broad interest in promoting gardening especially to reduce the risk of diabetes with the added value of enhancing social capital in Navajo communities.",2,PRIMARY,Estimated Change in Child Fruit & Vegetable Self-efficacy,"Self-efficacy for eating F\&V score is average of responses to five 4-point Likert scale questions.

We conducted a pilot study of metformin, a medication efficacious in treating and preventing diabetes while reducing hyperinsulinemia, among persons with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) with the goal of collecting preliminary data on feasibility, safety, and efficacy. Participants were 80 men and women aged 55 to 90 years with aMCI, overweight or obese, without treated diabetes. We randomized participants to metformin 1000 mg twice a day or matching placebo for 12 months. The co-primary clinical outcomes were changes from baseline to 12 months in total recall of the Selective Reminding Test (SRT) and the score of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog). The secondary outcome was change in relative glucose uptake in the posterior cingulate-precuneus in brain fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. Change in plasma Aβ42 was an exploratory outcome. The mean age of participants was 65 years. Fifty percent of participants were women. The only baseline variable that was different between the arms was the ADAS-Cog. Metformin could not be tolerated by 7.5% of participants; 15% tolerated 500 mg/day, 35% tolerated 1000 mg/day, 32.5% tolerated 1500 mg/day, and only 10% tolerated the maximum dose. There were no serious adverse events related to metformin. The 7.5% of persons who did not tolerate metformin reported gastrointestinal symptoms. After adjusting for baseline ADAS-cog, changes in total recall of the SRT favored the metformin group (9.7±8.5 versus 5.3±8.5; p = 0.02). Differences for other outcomes were not significant.

Consistent with the Institute of Medicine's (IOM) emphasis on patients transitioning from treatment to cancer survivorship and increasing long-term healthy behaviors in these survivors, we plan to conduct a pilot RCT to address the increasing overweight/obesity rates among PCS by targeting their caregivers as agents for PCS behavior change. We plan to focus on parents' behaviors, attitudes and roles in promoting healthier eating and physical activity (PA) in PCS and adapt an evidence-informed, manualized parent intervention - NOURISH - found to be effective for parents of overweight and obese children and adolescents in reducing child and adolescent BMI. We plan to adapt NOURISH for caregivers of 5-12 year old PCS (6 months-4 years off active cancer treatment). Our pilot feasibility RCT - NOURISH-T (Nourishing Our Understanding of Role modeling to Improve Support for Healthy Transitions) evaluates: 1) the preliminary efficacy of NOURISH-T for PCS, compared with an Enhanced Usual Care (EUC) control condition, and 2) factors to consider to improve future adaptations of the intervention.

This study evaluated whether entry to a therapeutic workplace could reinforce adherence with oral naltrexone. Opiate-dependent and cocaine-using injection drug users were detoxified, inducted onto oral naltrexone, and randomly assigned to a contingency (n = 35) or prescription (n = 32) group for a 26-week period. Contingency participants were required to ingest naltrexone under staff observation to gain access to the therapeutic workplace. Prescription participants received a take-home supply of naltrexone and could access the workplace independent of naltrexone ingestion. Primary outcome measures were percent of urine samples positive for naltrexone at 30-day assessments and negative for opiates and cocaine at 30-day assessments. Contingency participants provided significantly more urine samples that were positive for naltrexone compared with prescription participants (72% vs. 21%, p < .01); however, no effect of experimental group was observed on percent opiate-negative (71% vs. 60%, p = .19.) or cocaine-negative (56% vs. 53%, p = .82) samples in the contingency and prescription groups, respectively. Opiate-positive samples were significantly more likely to occur in conjunction with cocaine (p < .001) and when not protected by naltrexone (p < .02), independent of experimental group.

METHODS: After a 2 week placebo run-in period, eligible patients inadequately controlled on long-acting, intermediate-acting or premixed insulin (HbA1c > or = 7.5% and < or = 11%), were randomised 1:1 to the addition of once-daily sitagliptin 100 mg or matching placebo over a 24-week study period. The study capped the proportion of randomised patients on insulin plus metformin at 75%. Further, the study capped the proportion of randomised patients on premixed insulin at 25%. The metformin dose and the insulin dose were to remain stable throughout the study. The primary endpoint was HbA1c change from baseline at week 24.
RESULTS: Mean baseline characteristics were similar between the sitagliptin (n = 322) and placebo (n = 319) groups, including HbA1c (8.7 vs. 8.6%), diabetes duration (13 vs. 12 years), body mass index (31.4 vs. 31.4 kg/m(2)), and total daily insulin dose (51 vs. 52 IU), respectively. At 24 weeks, the addition of sitagliptin significantly (p < 0.001) reduced HbA1c by 0.6% compared with placebo (0.0%). A greater proportion of patients achieved an HbA1c level < 7% while randomised to sitagliptin as compared with placebo (13 vs. 5% respectively; p < 0.001). Similar HbA1c reductions were observed in the patient strata defined by insulin type (long-acting and intermediate-acting insulins or premixed insulins) and by baseline metformin treatment.

In this paper, we present results from an analysis of existing data about the demographic and clinical characteristics, service needs and utilization patterns, and primary care retention of HIV-positive primary care patients seen at FCHC during a 24-month study period. Patient data were extracted from Logician, FCHC's electronic medical record system, and imported into Microsoft Access, Microsoft Excel and SAS for manipulation and analysis. A total of 999 unique individuals were included in the study population. Most were men (97%), white (75%) and between 39 and 80 years of age. Patients averaged 6.7 medical visits annually at FCHC, and 61% had at least one medical visit every six months. Significant predictors of primary care utilization were insurance status, HIV disease stage, being on combination therapy, first CD4 count, first viral load level and receipt of ancillary services. Need and receipt of ancillary services were found through medical and case management record review; case management was the most used ancillary service, received by 36% of the study population. For most ancillary services, clients with assessed need had documented receipt of the service. Publicly insured and/or Ryan White CARE Act-funded patients had the greatest ancillary service utilization. The influence of ancillary services upon primary care entry could not be evaluated with available data; however, their influence upon primary care was significant. For patients who received primary care in every continuous six-month period, statistically significant associations were found with receipt of mental health care, case management, drug assistance, food/nutrition, complementary services and housing.

Also the first-line treatment for adolescent ADHD, stimulant medication, is underutilized in routine practice. This article briefly describes three behavioral interventions designed to promote stronger integration of medication interventions into treatment planning for adolescent ADHD: family ADHD psychoeducation, family-based medication decision-making, and behavior therapist leadership in coordinating medication integration. It then introduces the Medication Integration Protocol (MIP), which incorporates all three interventions into a five-task protocol: ADHD Assessment and Medication Consult; ADHD Psychoeducation and Client Acceptance; ADHD Symptoms and Family Relations; ADHD Medication and Family Decision-Making; and Medication Management and Integration Planning.

DESIGN: Prospective.
SETTING: University-affiliated, pediatric medical center.
PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred ninety-four children.
INTERVENTIONS: Coagulation tests.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Demographic, coagulation test, blood loss, and transfusion data were noted in consecutive children undergoing cardiac surgery. Laboratory tests included hematocrit (Hct), prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time (PTT), platelet count, fibrinogen concentration, and thromboelastography. Stepwise linear regression analysis indicated that platelet count during CPB was the variable most significantly associated with intraoperative blood loss (in milliliters per kilogram) and 12-hour chest tube output (in milliliters per kilogram). Other independent variables associated with blood loss were thromboelastography maximum amplitude (MA) during CPB, preoperative PTT, preoperative Hct, and preoperative thromboelastography angle and shear modulus values. Thromboelastography MA during CPB was the only variable associated with total products transfused (in milliliters per kilogram). Of all tests studied, platelet count during CPB (< or = 108,000/microL) provided the maximum sensitivity (83%) and specificity (58%) for prediction of excessive blood loss (receiver operating characteristic analysis). Blood loss was inversely related to patient age; neonates received the most donor units (median, 8 units; range, 6 to 10 units).
CONCLUSIONS: During cardiac surgery, coagulation tests (including thromboelastography) drawn pre-CPB and during CPB are useful to identify children at risk for excessive bleeding.

We used transcranial Doppler to compare cerebral blood flow velocity changes (Vmca) during recovery after anesthesia. In the first part of the study, 30 patients were randomized to propofol- or isoflurane-based anesthesia. Vmca, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and CO(2) partial pressure (PaCO(2)) were measured before anesthesia, at tracheal extubation, at 5 to 60 min after extubation, and at 24 h after anesthesia. There was a 60% increase in Vmca above the awake value at extubation. The increase in Vmca was significant at least for 30 min after extubation. There was no difference between the Propofol and Isoflurane anesthesia groups. There was no correlation between Vmca and MAP or PaCO(2) at any time. In the second part of the study, Vmca, MAP, and jugular venous bulb saturation in oxygen (SjvO(2)) were measured after isoflurane anesthesia. SjvO(2) increased significantly at extubation, consistent with cerebral hyperemia. In conclusion, cerebral hyperemia occurs during recovery from general anesthesia independently of the anesthetic technique or hemodynamic or ventilatory changes. It is speculated that cerebral hyperemia is a nonspecific response to stress during emergence from anesthesia.
IMPLICATIONS: Cerebral hyperemia occurs during emergence from general anesthesia.

Aflibercept is a recombinant human fusion protein that binds A and B isoforms of VEGF and placental growth factor, thereby inhibiting angiogenesis. We assessed whether the addition of aflibercept to docetaxel and prednisone would improve overall survival in men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer compared with the addition of placebo to docetaxel and prednisone.
METHODS: VENICE was a phase 3, multicentre, randomised double-blind placebo-controlled parallel group study done in 31 countries (187 sites). Men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, adequate organ function, and no prior chemotherapy were treated with docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) intravenously every 3 weeks) and oral prednisone (5 mg twice daily) and randomly allocated (1:1) to receive aflibercept (6 mg/kg) or placebo, intravenously, every 3 weeks. Treatment allocation was done centrally via an interactive voice response system, using a computer-generated sequence with a permuted-block size of four and stratified according Eastern Co-operative Group performance status (0-1 vs 2). Patients, investigators, and other individuals responsible for study conduct and data analysis were masked to treatment assignment. Aflibercept or placebo vials were supplied in identical boxes. The primary endpoint was overall survival using intention-to-treat analysis. This is the primary analysis of the completed trial. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00519285 FINDINGS: Between Aug 17, 2007, and Feb 11, 2010, 1224 men were randomly allocated to treatment: 612 to each group. At final analysis, median follow-up was 35 months (IQR 29-41) and 873 men had died. Median overall survival was 22·1 months (95·6% CI 20·3-24·1) in the aflibercept group and 21·2 months (19·6-23·8) in the placebo group (stratified hazard ratio 0·94, 95·6% CI 0·82-1·08; p=0·38). We recorded a higher incidence of grade 3-4 gastrointestinal disorders (182 [30%] vs 48 [8·0%]), haemorrhagic events (32 [5·2%] vs ten [1·7%]), hypertension (81 [13%] vs 20 [3·3%]), fatigue (97 [16%] vs 46 [7·7%]), infections (123 [20%] vs 60 [10%]) and treatment-related fatal adverse events (21 [3·4%] vs nine [1·5%]) in the aflibercept group than in the placebo group.
INTERPRETATION: Aflibercept in combination with docetaxel and prednisone given as first-line chemotherapy for men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer resulted in no improvement in overall survival and added toxicity compared with placebo.

This study investigated whether cigarette demand predicted response to contingent monetary rewards for abstinence among individuals with substance use disorders. It also sought to replicate evidence for greater price sensitivity at whole-dollar pack price transitions (ie, left-digit effects).
METHODS: Participants (N = 338) were individuals in residential substance use disorder treatment who participated in a randomized controlled trial that compared contingent vouchers to noncontingent vouchers for smoking abstinence. Baseline demand indices were used to predict number of abstinent days during the 14-day voucher period (after the reduction lead-in) and at 1 and 3 months afterward.
RESULTS: Demand indices correlated with measures of smoking and nicotine dependence. As measured by elasticity, intensity and O max, higher demand significantly predicted fewer abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings during voucher period for individuals in the noncontingent vouchers condition. Breakpoint exhibited a trend-level association with abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings. Demand indices did not predict abstinence in the contingent vouchers group, and did not predict abstinence at 1- and 3-month follow-ups. Left-digit price transitions were associated with significantly greater reductions in consumption.
CONCLUSIONS: The association of cigarette demand with smoking behavior only in the group for whom abstinence was not incentivized indicates that CPT assesses the value of smoking more than the value of money per se and that vouchers counteract the effects of the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes. Results provide initial short-term evidence of predictive validity for the CPT indices.
IMPLICATIONS: This study provides the first evidence of the validity of the CPT for predicting early response to brief advice for smoking cessation plus nicotine replacement in smokers with substance dependence. However, demand for cigarettes did not predict voucher-based treatment response, indicating that incentives serve as a powerful motivator not to smoke that acts in opposition to the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes and that the indices reflect the value of smoking more than the value of money per se.",0,PRIMARY,Number of Participants Smoking Abstinent in Past 7 Days,7 -day smoking cessation confirmed by expired alveolar CO levels of \< 10 ppm or salivary cotinine \< 16 ng/ml.,Contingency Management (CM),Noncontingent Reinforcement (NR),"Condition provides contingent monetary reinforcement for smoking reductions (first 5 days) then for smoking abstinence (subsequent 14 days).

METHODS: In a phase 2, double-blind study, patients with schizophrenia and AUD experiencing ≥ 10 drinking and ≥ 2 heavy-drinking days in the previous month and recent (≤ 6 mo) disease symptom exacerbation were recruited between June 2014 and March 2017. DSM-IV-TR and DSM-5 criteria were used to assign the diagnoses of schizophrenia and AUD, respectively. After a 6-week lead-in period, 234 eligible patients were randomized (1:1) to olanzapine + 10 mg samidorphan tablets (OLZ/SAM) or olanzapine + placebo tablets (olanzapine) for 36-60 weeks of treatment. The primary outcome of time to the first event of exacerbation of disease symptoms (EEDS) was evaluated using the log rank test for treatment comparison, and the Cox proportional-hazards model was used to estimate hazard ratio. Safety was assessed as adverse events and laboratory measures.
RESULTS: No significant difference was observed between groups in the time to first EEDS (hazard ratio = 0.91; 95% CI, 0.53-1.56; P = .746).

Since the phase-out of chlorofluorocarbon nasal aerosols, intranasal corticosteroids have been available only as aqueous nasal sprays. This study was designed to assess the efficacy, safety, and quality-of-life benefits of beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) hydrofluoroalkane nasal aerosol in subjects with perennial AR (PAR). After a 7- to 21-day placebo run-in period, eligible subjects aged ≥12 years with PAR were randomized to 6 weeks of once-daily treatment with BDP nasal aerosol at 320 μg or placebo. Reflective and instantaneous total nasal symptom scores (rTNSS and iTNSS, respectively), Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) score, and physician-assessed total nasal symptom score were evaluated.

METHODS: Pilot randomized controlled trial of adult patients with OUD initiating buprenorphine treatment (n = 78) at two sites (Seattle, WA and Boston, MA) from January 2019 to May 2020. Intervention was video DOT using a HIPAA-compliant smartphone application to record taking daily buprenorphine. Study smartphones, text reminders to upload a video, and calendar summaries of video DOT adherence were provided. Main outcomes were 1) percentage of 12 weekly urine drug tests (UDT) negative for illicit opioids and 2) engagement in treatment at week 12 (i.e., having an active prescription for buprenorphine within the last 7 days).
RESULTS: Of 78 enrolled, 20 (26 %) were female; 29 (37 %) non-white; and 31 (40 %) homeless. The mean (standard deviation) percentage of doses confirmed by video was 31 % (34 %). In intention-to-treat analysis, the average percentage of weekly opioid negative UDT was 50 % (95 % CI: 40-63 %) in the intervention arm versus 64 % (95 % CI: 55-74 %) among controls; RR = 0.78 (95 % CI: 0.60-1.02, p = 0.07). Engagement at week 12 was 69 % (95 % CI: 56-86 %) v. 82 % (95 % CI: 71-95 %) in the intervention vs. TAU arms, respectively; RR = 0.84 (95 % CI: 0.65-1.10, p = 0.20).
CONCLUSIONS: The video DOT intervention did not result in improvements in illicit opioid use and treatment engagement compared to TAU. The study was limited by low rates of intervention use.

The aim of this study was to determine the demographic, clinical, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) factors associated with QOL 10 years after CIS.
METHODS: Controlled High Risk Avonex® Multiple Sclerosis Prevention Study in Ongoing Neurologic Surveillance (CHAMPIONS) 10-year patients were assessed for CDMS, EDSS score, MRI T2 activity, brain parenchymal fraction, and patient-reported QOL. Associations were evaluated using analysis of variance models.
RESULTS: A second clinical event consistent with CDMS and higher EDSS scores at years 5 and 10 were associated with lower 36-item Short Form Health Status Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Summary scores at year 10 (P < .01). Patients with earlier onset of CDMS had worse patient-reported Physical Component Summary, SF-36 Mental Component Summary, fatigue, and pain scores at year 10 than patients with later or no onset of CDMS. Neither initial randomization group nor any MRI metrics assessed at baseline or during follow-up were associated with QOL at 10 years.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether fluoxetine can promote recovery and prolong time-to-relapse among patients with anorexia nervosa following weight restoration.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. From January 2000 until May 2005, 93 patients with anorexia nervosa received intensive inpatient or day-program treatment at the New York State Psychiatric Institute or Toronto General Hospital. Participants regained weight to a minimum body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters) of 19.0 and were then eligible to participate in the randomized phase of the trial.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned to receive fluoxetine or placebo and were treated for up to 1 year as outpatients in double-blind fashion. All patients also received individual cognitive behavioral therapy.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measures were time-to-relapse and the proportion of patients successfully completing 1 year of treatment.
RESULTS: Forty-nine patients were assigned to fluoxetine and 44 to placebo. Similar percentages of patients assigned to fluoxetine and to placebo maintained a body mass index of at least 18.5 and remained in the study for 52 weeks (fluoxetine, 26.5%; placebo, 31.5%; P = .57). In a Cox proportional hazards analysis, with prerandomization body mass index, site, and diagnostic subtype as covariates, there was no significant difference between fluoxetine and placebo in time-to-relapse (hazard ratio, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.65-2.01; P = .64).
CONCLUSIONS: This study failed to demonstrate any benefit from fluoxetine in the treatment of patients with anorexia nervosa following weight restoration. Future efforts should focus on developing new models to understand the persistence of this illness and on exploring new psychological and pharmacological treatment approaches.

METHODS: In a randomised, open-label study, 121 healthy women, 18-50 years of age, were randomly assigned to receive NOMAC/E2 (2.5 mg/1.5 mg) in a 24/4-day regimen (n=60) or LNG/EE (150 μg/30 μg) in a 21/7-day regimen (n=61) for six cycles. The primary outcome was the change from baseline to cycle 6 for all indices.
RESULTS: All parameters were similar at baseline between the two groups. Over six cycles, NOMAC/E2 had less effect on most haemostatic indices than LNG/EE. Lipids were essentially unchanged with NOMAC/E2, whereas with LNG/EE high-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides slightly increased. NOMAC/E2 induced negligible changes in glucose and insulin parameters, in contrast to LNG/EE. A much smaller increase in CRP was observed with NOMAC/E2 than with LNG/EE. NOMAC/E2 was associated with a greater increase in SHBG.

OBJECTIVE: To examine mortality from HBV; HCV; and, for comparison, HIV.
DESIGN: Analysis of U.S. multiple-cause mortality data from 1999 to 2007 from the National Center for Health Statistics.
SETTING: All U.S. states and the District of Columbia.
PARTICIPANTS: Approximately 22 million decedents.
MEASUREMENTS: Age-adjusted mortality rates from HBV, HCV, and HIV. Logistic regression analyses of 2007 data generated 4 independent models per outcome (HCV- or HBV-related deaths) that each included 1 of 4 comorbid conditions and all sociodemographic characteristics.
RESULTS: Between 1999 and 2007, recorded deaths from HCV [corrected] increased significantly to 15,106, whereas deaths from HIV declined to 12,734 by 2007. Factors associated with HCV-related deaths included chronic liver disease, HBV co-infection, alcohol-related conditions, minority status, and HIV co-infection. Factors that increased odds of HBV-related death included chronic liver disease, HCV co-infection, Asian or Pacific Islander descent, HIV co-infection, and alcohol-related conditions. Most deaths from HBV and HCV occurred in middle-aged persons.
LIMITATION: A person other than the primary physician of the decedent frequently completed the death certificate, and HCV and HBV often were not detected and thus not reported as causes of death.
CONCLUSION: By 2007, HCV had superseded HIV as a cause of death in the United States, and deaths from HCV and HBV disproportionately occurred in middle-aged persons. To achieve decreases in mortality similar to those seen with HIV requires new policy initiatives to detect patients with chronic hepatitis and link them to care and treatment.

It was hypothesized that vecuronium impairs carotid body chemoreceptor function during hypoxia.
METHOD: The effect of systemic administration of vecuronium on single chemoreceptor activity during hypoxia, as recorded from a single nerve fiber preparation of the carotid sinus nerve, was studied in seven mechanically ventilated New Zealand White rabbits during continuous thiopental anesthesia. During normoventilation, the isocapnic hypoxic chemosensitivity of the single carotid body chemoreceptor was measured at four levels of oxygenation; these measurements were repeated at six separate occasions: control recording before injection, after intravenous administrations of 0.1 mg and 0.5 mg of vecuronium, and then at three occasions during a 90-min recovery period. Chemoreceptor chemosensitivity during isocapnic hypoxia was expressed as a hyperbolic function: Chemoreceptor output (Hz) = a + b x PaO2(-1) (mmHg).
RESULTS: Chemosensitivity was reduced after both 0.1 mg and 0.5 mg vecuronium intravenous administration compared with control measurements; the hypoxic response curve was significantly depressed after both doses (P < 0.05). Notably, there was variation in the effect of vecuronium; some chemoreceptor preparations showed only minimal impairment, whereas some showed an almost abolished response to hypoxia. The chemosensitivity remained significantly depressed at 30 and 60 min but had recovered spontaneously at 90 min after 0.5 mg vecuronium.
DISCUSSION: It is concluded that vecuronium depresses carotid body chemoreceptor function to a varying extent during hypoxia and that the depression recovers spontaneously.",2,PRIMARY,Duration of Surgery,Measured from the time of first skin incision to completion of skin closure.,"Deep Neuromuscular Blockade, Reversal With Sugammadex","Normal Neuromuscular Blockade, Reversal With Neostigmine","a continuous rocuronium infusion (0.6mg/kg (lean body mass)/h,) is started and titrated to a post tetanic count of 1-2 twitches.
