Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis showed a non-significant improvement in NRS score, in favor of Sativex. The per protocol (PP) population (79% of subjects) change in NRS score and responder analyses (> or =30% improvement from baseline) were both significantly superior for Sativex, compared with placebo: -1.3 versus -0.8 points (change from baseline, p=0.035); and 36% versus 24% (responders, p=0.040). These were supported by the time to response (ITT: p=0.068; PP: p=0.025) analyses, carer global impression of change assessment (p=0.013) and timed 10-meter walk (p=0.042). Among the subjects who achieved a > or =30% response in spasticity with Sativex, 98, 94 and 73% reported improvements of 10, 20 and 30%, respectively, at least once during the first 4 weeks of treatment. Sativex was generally well tolerated, with most adverse events reported being mild-to-moderate in severity.\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The 0-10 NRS and responder PP analyses demonstrated that Sativex treatment resulted in a significant reduction in treatment-resistant spasticity, in subjects with advanced MS and severe spasticity. The response observed within the first 4 weeks of treatment appears to be a useful aid to prediction of responder/non-responder status.\n## Response:\nFALSE"}

This study examined the cost-effectiveness of EMR-based CDS for adults with diabetes from the perspective of the health care system.\nDATA SOURCES/SETTING: Clinical outcome and cost data from a randomized clinical trial of EMR-based CDS were used as inputs into a diabetes simulation model. The simulation cohort included 1,092 patients with diabetes with A1c above goal at baseline.\nSTUDY DESIGN: The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study Outcomes Model, a validated simulation model of diabetes, was used to evaluate remaining life years, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and health care costs over patient lifetimes (40-year time horizon) from the health system perspective.\nPRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Patients in the intervention group had significantly lowered A1c (0.26 percent, p\u00a0=\u00a0.014) relative to patients in the control arm. Intervention costs were $120 (SE\u00a0=\u00a045) per patient in the first year and $76 (SE\u00a0=\u00a045) per patient in the following years. In the base case analysis, EMR-based CDS increased lifetime QALYs by 0.04 (SE\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and increased lifetime costs by $112 (SE\u00a0=\u00a0660), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $3,017 per QALY. The cost-effectiveness of EMR-based CDS persisted in one-way, two-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.\nCONCLUSIONS: Widespread adoption of sophisticated EMR-based CDS has the potential to modestly improve the quality of care for patients with chronic conditions without substantially increasing costs to the health care system.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data were used to examine the incidence, manifestations, and survival in patients with melanoma with respect to race/ethnicity.\nMETHODS: A SEER search (1992-2002) for primary invasive cutaneous melanoma cases identified 48 143 whites, 932 Hispanics, 394 Asian/Pacific islanders, 251 African Americans, and 52 American Indians. Multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the relationship between race/ethnicity and clinicopathologic factors; associations between race/ethnicity and survival were examined using the Cox proportional hazards model.\nRESULTS: Based on our cohort of patients, the average annual age-adjusted melanoma incidence per 100 000 persons was 18.4 for whites compared with 2.3, 0.8, 1.6, and 1.0 for Hispanics, African Americans, American Indians, and Asians, respectively. Lower extremity and acral lentiginous melanomas were more common among minorities. Overall 5-year survival was 72.2% to 81.1% for minorities compared with 89.6% for whites. A 1.96- to 3.01-fold greater risk of disease-specific mortality persisted in minorities compared with whites after adjusting for age, sex, and region. In addition, Hispanics (odds ratio [OR], 3.6), African Americans (OR, 4.2), American Indians (OR, 3.4), and Asians (OR, 2.4) were more likely to present with stage IV melanoma than were whites. African Americans had a 1.48-fold higher rate of risk-adjusted, stage-specific mortality compared with whites.\nCONCLUSIONS: Melanoma is a public health concern for all ethnic populations. Differences in disease stage at presentation contributes to disparities in survival. Understanding melanoma in minority populations may lead to early detection and ultimately save lives.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

A convenience sample of 30 premature infants was selected from three neonatal intensive care units. A one-group repeated measures design was adopted for this study. The oxygen saturation of all subjects was first measured while they were receiving endotracheal suctioning during a four-hour control period with regular care. Then, four hours after the control period was completed, an experimental period began in which the music \" Transitions \" was played. One minute before suctioning, the level of oxygen saturation was measured to provide the baseline data. During a period of 30 minutes after suctioning, the oxygen saturation was recorded every minute to analyze the clinical effects of music therapy. The results showed that premature infants receiving music therapy with endotracheal suctioning had a significantly higher SPO(2); than that when not receiving music therapy (p <.01), and the level of oxygen saturation returned to the baseline level faster than when they did not receive music therapy (p <.01). Accordingly, it is hoped that giving appropriate music therapy as developmental care to premature infants when performing any nursing intervention may enhance not only the quality of nursing care but also quality of the infant's life.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Physical rehabilitation after stroke enhances neuroplasticity and improves limb function, but does not typically restore normal movement. We have recently developed a novel method that uses vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) paired with forelimb movements to drive specific, long-lasting map plasticity in rat primary motor cortex. Here we report that VNS paired with rehabilitative training can enhance recovery of forelimb force generation following infarction of primary motor cortex in rats. Quantitative measures of forelimb function returned to pre-lesion levels when VNS was delivered during rehab training. Intensive rehab training without VNS failed to restore function back to pre-lesion levels. Animals that received VNS during rehab improved twice as much as rats that received the same rehabilitation without VNS. VNS delivered during physical rehabilitation represents a novel method that may provide long-lasting benefits towards stroke recovery.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Participants were randomized to receive either recommended usual care (R-UC; 10 min of in-person counseling, 8 weeks of nicotine patch, and referral to quitline services) or abstinence-optimized treatment (A-OT; 3 weeks of prequit mini-lozenges, 26 weeks of nicotine patch + mini-lozenges, three in-person and eight phone counseling sessions, and 7-11 automated calls to prompt medication use). The key outcomes were self-reported and biochemically confirmed (carbon monoxide, CO <6 ppm) 7-day point-prevalence abstinence.\nRESULTS: A-OT participants had significantly higher self-reported abstinence rates than R-UC participants at 4, 8, 16, and 26 weeks (ORs: 1.91-3.05; p <. 001). The biochemically confirmed 26-week abstinence rates were lower than the self-reported 26-week rates, but revealed a similar treatment effect size (OR = 2.94, p < .001). There was no moderation of treatment effects on 26-week abstinence by demographic, psychiatric, or nicotine dependence variables.

Acceptance and commitment therapy, a promising intervention for cancer-related suffering, has rarely been applied to dyads coping with advanced cancer.\nAIM: To examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of acceptance and commitment therapy for patient-caregiver dyads coping with advanced gastrointestinal cancer. Primary outcomes were patient fatigue interference and caregiver burden.\nDESIGN: In this pilot trial, dyads were randomized to six weekly sessions of telephone-delivered acceptance and commitment therapy or education/support, an attention control. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and at 2\u2009weeks and 3\u2009months post-intervention.\nSETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Forty patients with stage III-IV gastrointestinal cancer and fatigue interference and family caregivers with burden or distress were recruited from two oncology clinics and randomized.\nRESULTS: The eligibility screening rate (54%) and retention rate (81% at 2\u2009weeks post-intervention) demonstrated feasibility. At 2\u2009weeks post-intervention, acceptance and commitment therapy participants reported high intervention helpfulness (mean\u2009=\u20094.25/5.00). Group differences in outcomes were not statistically significant. However, when examining within-group change, acceptance and commitment therapy patients showed moderate decline in fatigue interference at both follow-ups, whereas education/support patients did not show improvement at either follow-up. Acceptance and commitment therapy caregivers showed medium decline in burden at 2\u2009weeks that was not sustained at 3\u2009months, whereas education/support caregivers showed little change in burden.\nCONCLUSIONS: Acceptance and commitment therapy showed strong feasibility, acceptability, and promise and warrants further testing.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04010227.

We attempted a conceptual replication test of these results via a randomized trial of instructions to continue vs. stop nicotine patch after a lapse.\nMETHODS: Smokers trying to quit (n=701) received nicotine patch (21/14/7mg) and brief phone counseling (six 15-min sessions). We randomized smokers to receive instructions for and rationale for stopping vs. continuing patch after a lapse. The messages were repeated before and after cessation and following lapses via counseling, phone and written instructions.\nRESULTS: Among those who lapsed, those told to Continue Patch did not have a greater incidence of 7-day abstinence at 4months (primary outcome) than those told to Discontinue Patch (51% vs. 46%). Most (81%) participants in the Discontinue condition stopped patch for only 1-2days and then resumed abstinence and patch use. Analyses based on all participants randomized were similar. Adverse events were as expected and did not differ between conditions.\nCONCLUSION: Instructions to continue nicotine patch after a lapse did not increase return to abstinence. These negative results may have occurred because actual use of patch after a lapse was similar in the two conditions. Also, allowing patch use while smoking may have reduced motivation to stay abstinent.\n## Response:\nFALSE"}

The median follow-up time was 20.0 weeks in the panitumumab plus BSC group and 18.2 weeks in the BSC alone group.\nAbstract: PURPOSE: Panitumumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). We compared the activity of panitumumab plus best supportive care (BSC) to that of BSC alone in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who had progressed after standard chemotherapy.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: We randomly assigned 463 patients with 1% or more EGFR tumor cell membrane staining, measurable disease, and radiologic documentation of disease progression during or within 6 months of most recent chemotherapy to panitumumab 6 mg/kg every 2 weeks plus BSC (n = 231) or BSC alone (n = 232). Tumor assessments by blinded central review were scheduled from week 8 until disease progression. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included objective response, overall survival (OS), and safety. BSC patients who progressed could receive panitumumab in a cross-over study.\nRESULTS: Panitumumab significantly prolonged PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.54; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.66, [P < .0001]). Median PFS time was 8 weeks (95% CI, 7.9 to 8.4) for panitumumab and 7.3 weeks (95% CI, 7.1 to 7.7) for BSC. Mean (standard error) PFS time was 13.8 (0.8) weeks for panitumumab and 8.5 (0.5) weeks for BSC. Objective response rates also favored panitumumab over BSC; after a 12-month minimum follow-up, response rates were 10% for panitumumab and 0% for BSC (P < .0001). No difference was observed in OS (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.22), which was confounded by similar activity of panitumumab after 76% of BSC patients entered the cross-over study. Panitumumab was well tolerated. Skin toxicities, hypomagnesaemia, and diarrhea were the most common toxicities observed. No patients had grade 3/4 infusion reactions.\nCONCLUSION: Panitumumab significantly improved PFS with manageable toxicity in patients with chemorefractory colorectal cancer.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Presented here is a pooled analysis of safety and tolerability data from all completed short-term, placebo-controlled trials in schizophrenia from the aripiprazole clinical development program. Data were analyzed from five 4- to 6-week double-blind multicenter studies of patients hospitalized with acute relapse of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder randomized to aripiprazole (n=932), placebo (n=416), or haloperidol (n=201). Daily aripiprazole doses ranged from 2 to 30 mg. Safety assessments included adverse event (AE) reports, EPS scales, ECGs, weight, and prolactin, glucose and cholesterol levels. Aripiprazole was well tolerated, with similar AE incidence rates to placebo, and lower rates than haloperidol for akathisia, extrapyramidal syndrome and somnolence. Objective EPS assessments demonstrated no significant differences between aripiprazole and placebo on Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS) scores, no dose-dependent effects on Barnes Akathisia scores, and significant reductions in Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) scores from baseline vs. placebo (p</=0.01). Haloperidol showed increased SAS and Barnes Akathisia scores over placebo (p</=0.01). There was minimal mean weight change with aripiprazole (+0.71 kg) and haloperidol (+0.56 kg), and a lack of QT(c) prolongation. Serum prolactin increased with haloperidol, but not aripiprazole. In conclusion, aripiprazole shows a favorable safety and tolerability profile with low potential for EPS, weight gain, prolactin elevation, QT(c) prolongation, and sedation. Aripiprazole's safety profile may offer benefits in schizophrenia treatment.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

I propose a glossary of confusing terms pertaining to the patellofemoral joint, the various interpretations of these terms, and possible resolutions of these conflicts.

Combination immunotherapy with lenalidomide and rituximab is an immunomodulatory regimen that has shown promising activity in patients with indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\nMETHODS: We conducted this multicenter, international, phase 3 superiority trial to evaluate rituximab plus lenalidomide, as compared with rituximab plus chemotherapy, in patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma. Patients were randomly assigned to receive one of the two regimens, followed by maintenance monotherapy with rituximab. Treatment with rituximab plus lenalidomide consisted of 18 cycles of the two drugs, followed by rituximab maintenance therapy every 8 weeks for 12 cycles (six additional doses). Treatment with rituximab plus chemotherapy consisted of the investigator's choice of one of three rituximab-based regimens, followed by maintenance monotherapy with rituximab every 8 weeks for 12 cycles. The primary end points were complete response (confirmed or unconfirmed) at 120 weeks and progression-free survival.\nRESULTS: A total of 1030 patients were randomly assigned to receive rituximab plus lenalidomide (513 patients) or rituximab plus chemotherapy (517 patients). The rate of confirmed or unconfirmed complete response at 120 weeks was similar in the two groups: 48% (95% confidence interval [CI], 44 to 53) in the rituximab-lenalidomide group and 53% (95% CI, 49 to 57) in the rituximab-chemotherapy group (P=0.13). The interim 3-year rate of progression-free survival was 77% (95% CI, 72 to 80) and 78% (95% CI, 74 to 82), respectively. A higher percentage of patients in the rituximab-chemotherapy group had grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (32% vs. 50%) and febrile neutropenia of any grade (2% vs. 7%), and a higher percentage of patients in the rituximab-lenalidomide group had grade 3 or 4 cutaneous reactions (7% vs. 1%).\nCONCLUSIONS: Among patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma, efficacy results were similar with rituximab plus lenalidomide and rituximab plus chemotherapy (with both regimens followed by rituximab maintenance therapy). The safety profile differed in the two groups. (Funded by Celgene; RELEVANCE ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT01476787 and NCT01650701 , and EudraCT number, 2011-002792-42 .).\n## Response:\nNONE"}

In the present study hypoxia was induced via the mother, thus keeping the fetal circulation intact. The experiments were conducted on mature fetuses of three different species, namely 20 guinea-pig 3 cat and 3 lamb fetuses. The ECG was recorded continuoulsy and used for measuring the fetal heart rate. The vagal influence on the fetal hypoxic bradycardia was tested by comparing the time for the onset of the bradycardia with of without vagal activity. There was no indication of any vagal component in the fetal hypoxic bradycardia, which is therfore to be regarded rather as a sign of myocardial hypoxia and failing fetal circulation. The ECG recordings showed that the fetal bradycardia initially is an AV-block, type II, and that there are progressive changes in the S-T interval as an early sign of hypoxia.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Despite limited data, favipiravir is administered to patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in several countries.\nMETHODS: We conducted a phase 2, double-blind, randomized controlled outpatient trial of favipiravir in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic adults with a positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR) within 72\u2005hours of enrollment. Participants were randomized to receive placebo or favipiravir (1800\u2005mg twice daily [BID] day 1, 800\u2005mg BID days 2-10). The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 shedding cessation in a modified intention-to-treat (mITT) cohort of participants with positive enrollment RT-PCRs. Using SARS-CoV-2 amplicon-based sequencing, we assessed favipiravir's impact on mutagenesis.\nRESULTS: We randomized 149 participants with 116 included in the mITT cohort. The participants' mean age was 43 years (standard deviation, 12.5 years) and 57 (49%) were women. We found no difference in time to shedding cessation overall (hazard ratio [HR], 0.76 favoring placebo [95% confidence interval {CI}, .48-1.20]) or in subgroups (age, sex, high-risk comorbidities, seropositivity, or symptom duration at enrollment). We detected no difference in time to symptom resolution (initial: HR, 0.84 [95% CI, .54-1.29]; sustained: HR, 0.87 [95% CI, .52-1.45]) and no difference in transition mutation accumulation in the viral genome during treatment.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data do not support favipiravir at commonly used doses in outpatients with uncomplicated COVID-19. Further research is needed to ascertain if higher favipiravir doses are effective and safe for patients with COVID-19.\nCLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT04346628.\n## Response:\nFALSE"}

Given the high prevalence of chronic pain in the US, new strategies are needed to enhance access to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and other evidence-based treatments designed to facilitate self-management of chronic pain conditions. Although CBT is efficacious, many patients have limited or no access to CBT. Technology-assisted delivery of CBT may improve access while maintaining efficacy.\nMETHODS/DESIGN: We describe a randomized non-inferiority trial of interactive voice response (IVR)-based CBT for patients with chronic low back pain. This intervention uses daily IVR monitoring and weekly pre-recorded therapist feedback, based on patient-reported information, to provide treatment for patients at home. A total of 230 patients with chronic low back pain are being identified from a single statewide health system serving US military veterans. Participants are randomized to receive either ten weeks of in-person CBT or IVR-based CBT. The primary outcome is pain intensity as measured by the Numeric Rating Scale immediately post-treatment. Secondary outcomes include pain-related interference, emotional functioning, and quality of life measured immediately post treatment, and 6 and 9 months post recruitment. Exploratory objectives of the study are to examine: (1) potential mediators of impact on clinical outcomes (treatment retention, self-reported skill practice ratings, IVR call adherence, and treatment satisfaction); and (2) moderators of treatment engagement, adherence to therapist recommendations for pain coping skill practice, and effects on clinical outcomes.\nDISCUSSION: This non-inferiority trial may identify an alternative to resource intensive in-person CBT that allows many more patients to receive care while also increasing retention of those enrolled in the program.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01025752 .

The primary objective was to compare renal function at 6 months after transplant.\nRESULTS: Mean 6-month serum creatinine (primary safety variable) was 112+/-31 micromol/L (1.26+/-0.35 mg/dL) and 127+/-50 micromol/L (1.44+/-0.57 mg/dL) in the low and standard tacrolimus groups, respectively, (n.s.); mean estimated GFR (Nankivell) was 75.3+/-16.6 mL/min and 72.5+/-15.2 mL/min (n.s.). Biopsy-proven acute rejection occurred in 13 patients: seven (14%) in the low tacrolimus group and six (14%) in the standard tacrolimus group, n.s. One graft was lost in the standard tacrolimus group. No patients died.\nCONCLUSIONS: Tacrolimus exposure reduction in the presence of everolimus, steroids and basiliximab induction results in good efficacy in de novo renal transplant recipients with very well-preserved renal function. Additional studies are warranted because between-group comparisons were limited by the relatively small differences in tacrolimus exposure in the 2 arms; trough levels were toward the upper end of the low-exposure ranges and toward the bottom of the standard-exposure ranges.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Three-year rates are reported here.\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Oropharyngeal squamous-cell carcinomas caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) are associated with favorable survival, but the independent prognostic significance of tumor HPV status remains unknown.\nMETHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of the association between tumor HPV status and survival among patients with stage III or IV oropharyngeal squamous-cell carcinoma who were enrolled in a randomized trial comparing accelerated-fractionation radiotherapy (with acceleration by means of concomitant boost radiotherapy) with standard-fractionation radiotherapy, each combined with cisplatin therapy, in patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Proportional-hazards models were used to compare the risk of death among patients with HPV-positive cancer and those with HPV-negative cancer.\nRESULTS: The median follow-up period was 4.8 years. The 3-year rate of overall survival was similar in the group receiving accelerated-fractionation radiotherapy and the group receiving standard-fractionation radiotherapy (70.3% vs. 64.3%; P=0.18; hazard ratio for death with accelerated-fractionation radiotherapy, 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72 to 1.13), as were the rates of high-grade acute and late toxic events. A total of 63.8% of patients with oropharyngeal cancer (206 of 323) had HPV-positive tumors; these patients had better 3-year rates of overall survival (82.4%, vs. 57.1% among patients with HPV-negative tumors; P<0.001 by the log-rank test) and, after adjustment for age, race, tumor and nodal stage, tobacco exposure, and treatment assignment, had a 58% reduction in the risk of death (hazard ratio, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.66). The risk of death significantly increased with each additional pack-year of tobacco smoking. Using recursive-partitioning analysis, we classified our patients as having a low, intermediate, or high risk of death on the basis of four factors: HPV status, pack-years of tobacco smoking, tumor stage, and nodal stage.\nCONCLUSIONS: Tumor HPV status is a strong and independent prognostic factor for survival among patients with oropharyngeal cancer.

This review of the published literature was undertaken to assess the effect of such programs on pain and disability.\nMETHODS: Medline and HealthSTAR were searched for the period 1964-1998. The references of each article were then hand-searched for further publications. Studies were included in the meta-analysis if the intervention contained a self-management education component, a concurrent control group was included, and pain and/or disability were assessed as end points. Two authors reviewed each study. The methodologic attributes and efficacy of the interventions were assessed using a standardized abstraction tool, and the magnitude of the results was converted to a common measure, the effect size. Summary effect sizes were calculated separately for pain and disability.\nRESULTS: The search strategy yielded 35 studies, of which 17 met inclusion criteria. The mean age of study participants was 61 years, and 69% were female. On average, 19% of patients did not complete followup (range 0-53%). The summary effect size was 0.12 for pain (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.00, 0.24) and 0.07 for disability (95% CI 0.00, 0.15). Funnel plots indicated no significant evidence of bias toward the publication of studies with findings that showed reductions in pain or disability.\nCONCLUSION: The summary effect sizes suggest that arthritis self-management education programs result in small reductions in pain and disability.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers an evidence-based behavioral weight management intervention called MOVE!, mostly delivered through in-person group sessions. Few eligible Veterans participate due to factors like distance and preferences, mirroring barriers in the general population. Practical alternatives to standard in-person programs are needed to improve access and engagement. A self-directed lifestyle intervention called D-ELITE-delivered through pre-recorded videos by DVD or online streaming-previously efficacious in a general primary care population, may provide such an alternative. This pragmatic clinical trial will evaluate whether D-ELITE improves weight and general health status among Veterans with obesity, relative to VA usual care. The yearlong intervention includes one orientation by phone, supplemental lifestyle coaching primarily via technology-based messages, 12 DVD or online streaming sessions over 3\u00a0months, and continued self-directed weight management for months 4-12. Participants use MyFitnessPal.com or paper booklets for self-monitoring weight, diet, and physical activity. Follow-up assessments at 12 and 24\u00a0months are administered by mail or phone. The study hypothesis is that compared with usual care, D-ELITE will lead to greater improvements in 12-month weight loss, per VA electronic health records, and general physical health status, assessed using the self-reported SF-12 physical composite score. We will also explore D-ELITE's effects on secondary biometric (e.g., HbA1c) and intermediate (e.g., diet) outcomes, reach, and budget impact. If effective, D-ELITE will offer a potentially scalable, low-cost alternative to VA's existing weight loss interventions by mitigating barriers presented by distance and technology.\n## Response:\nFALSE"}

The underlying mechanism(s) may involve chronic low-grade systemic inflammation and immune cell activation. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (sitagliptin) improve glucose tolerance and may possess immunomodulatory effects because leukocyte CD26 cell surface receptors express dipeptidyl peptidase-4 activity.\nOBJECTIVE: Sitagliptin will reduce inflammatory and immune cell activation markers known to be elevated in cART-treated HIV-infected (HIV+) adults with impaired glucose tolerance.\nDESIGN: This was designed as a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of sitagliptin in HIV+ adults.\nSETTING: The setting was an academic medical center.\nPATIENTS: Patients were cART-treated HIV+ men and women (n = 36) with stable HIV disease and impaired glucose tolerance.\nINTERVENTIONS: Interventions included sitagliptin 100 mg/d or placebo for 8 weeks.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: At baseline and week 8, plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and C-X-C motif chemokine 10 concentrations (ELISA), oral glucose tolerance, and abdominal sc adipose mRNA expression for M1 macrophage markers (monocyte chemotactic protein-1, EGF-like module-containing, mucin-like hormone receptor 1).\nRESULTS: Sitagliptin reduced glucose area under the curve (P = .002) and improved oral glucose insulin sensitivity index (P = .04) more than placebo. Sitagliptin reduced plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and C-X-C motif chemokine 10 levels more than placebo (P < .009). Adipose tissue monocyte chemotactic protein-1 mRNA abundance declined significantly more (P = .01), and adipose EGF-like module-containing, mucin-like hormone receptor 1 mRNA expression tended to decline more (P = .19) in sitagliptin than placebo.\nCONCLUSION: Sitagliptin had beneficial systemic and adipose anti-inflammatory effects in cART-treated HIV+ adults with impaired glucose tolerance. Large-scale, long-term studies should determine whether sitagliptin reduces cardiovascular risk and events in HIV+ adults.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

Pharmacological treatment options, including antipsychotics are not satisfactory.\nOBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of citalopram for agitation in patients with Alzheimer disease. Key secondary objectives examined effects of citalopram on function, caregiver distress, safety, cognitive safety, and tolerability.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Citalopram for Agitation in Alzheimer Disease Study (CitAD) was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group trial that enrolled 186 patients with probable Alzheimer disease and clinically significant agitation from 8 academic centers in the United States and Canada from August 2009 to January 2013.\nINTERVENTIONS: Participants (n\u2009=\u2009186) were randomized to receive a psychosocial intervention plus either citalopram (n\u2009=\u200994) or placebo (n\u2009=\u200992) for 9 weeks. Dosage began at 10 mg per day with planned titration to 30 mg per day over 3 weeks based on response and tolerability.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome measures were based on scores from the 18-point Neurobehavioral Rating Scale agitation subscale (NBRS-A) and the modified Alzheimer Disease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change (mADCS-CGIC). Other outcomes were based on scores from the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), ability to complete activities of daily living (ADLs), caregiver distress, cognitive safety (based on scores from the 30-point Mini Mental State Examination [MMSE]), and adverse events.\nRESULTS: Participants who received citalopram showed significant improvement compared with those who received placebo on both primary outcome measures. The NBRS-A estimated treatment difference at week 9 (citalopram minus placebo) was -0.93 (95% CI, -1.80 to -0.06), P\u2009=\u2009.04. Results from the mADCS-CGIC showed 40% of citalopram participants having moderate or marked improvement from baseline compared with 26% of placebo recipients, with estimated treatment effect (odds ratio [OR] of being at or better than a given CGIC category) of 2.13 (95% CI, 1.23-3.69), P\u2009=\u2009.01. Participants who received citalopram showed significant improvement on the CMAI, total NPI, and caregiver distress scores but not on the NPI agitation subscale, ADLs, or in less use of rescue lorazepam. Worsening of cognition (-1.05 points; 95% CI, -1.97 to -0.13; P\u2009=\u2009.03) and QT interval prolongation (18.1 ms; 95% CI, 6.1-30.1; P\u2009=\u2009.01) were seen in the citalopram group.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with probable Alzheimer disease and agitation who were receiving psychosocial intervention, the addition of citalopram compared with placebo significantly reduced agitation and caregiver distress; however, cognitive and cardiac adverse effects of citalopram may limit its practical application at the dosage of 30 mg per day.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00898807.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

Week 12\nAbstract: AIM: Dapagliflozin is a stable, competitive, reversible, and highly selective inhibitor of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2, the major transporter responsible for renal glucose reabsorption. With an insulin-independent mechanism of action, dapagliflozin is currently being developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This work aims to compare the efficacy of dapagliflozin, as measured by the change in hemoglobin A1c concentration (A1c) and body weight, and to determine the pharmacodynamic effects of dapagliflozin, as measured by urinary glucose excretion in early-stage and late-stage T2DM patient populations.\nMETHODS: A total of 151 early-stage patients and 58 late-stage patients with T2DM randomly assigned 10 or 20 mg once daily (QD) dapagliflozin treatment or placebo for 12 weeks from two phase 2 studies were included in the analysis. A1c, body weight, and urinary glucose were compared between the two patient populations.\nRESULTS: Compared with the early-stage population, patients in the late-stage population had a longer duration of T2DM and higher baseline levels of A1c, body weight, fasting plasma glucose, and urinary glucose excretion. After 12 weeks of dapagliflozin treatment, A1c reduction, weight loss, and increased urinary glucose excretion from baseline were observed in both populations. Baseline A1c level impacted the A1c reduction after dapagliflozin treatment with a comparable effect in patients with early and late stage disease. Late-stage patients had greater reduction in body weight. There was no statistically significant difference in the amount of urinary glucose excretion between the early-stage and late-stage patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin treatment at 10 and 20 mg QD for 12 weeks resulted in significant improvement in glycaemic control and body weight reduction in both early-stage and late-stage patients with T2DM. The findings suggest that dapagliflozin could be a promising treatment option for a wide range of patients with T2DM.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Laboratory abnormalities included: platelets less than 100,000/mm, aspartate aminotransferase 100 units/L or greater, creatinine 1.5 mg/dL or greater, lactate dehydrogenase 600 units/L or greater, total bilirubin 1.2 mg/dL or greater, or evidence of hemolysis on peripheral smear. Mild pregnancy-associated hypertension was defined as blood pressure 140-159/90-109 mm Hg. Severe pregnancy-associated hypertension was defined as persistent blood pressure 160/110 mm Hg or greater, acute antihypertensive treatment, or any blood pressure elevation associated with clinical signs of end-organ dysfunction (one or more of headache, epigastric pain, blurred vision, pulmonary edema, eclampsia, or oliguria). Pregnancy outcomes were compared across four groups: I, mild hypertension alone; II, mild hypertension+abnormal laboratory values; III, severe pregnancy-associated hypertension alone; and IV, severe pregnancy-associated hypertension+abnormal laboratory values.\nRESULTS: Of 9,969 women, 2,752 (27.9%) developed pregnancy-associated hypertension and of these, laboratory abnormalities occurred in 7.3%. Laboratory abnormalities increased with severity of hypertension: mild hypertension alone (4.9%), severe hypertension alone (8.9%), and mild or severe hypertension with clinical signs of end-organ dysfunction (12.2%) (P for trend<.001). Compared with women with mild hypertension alone, the adjusted odds for the perinatal composite (2-fold to 4.8-fold in Category III-IV), preterm birth (2.1-fold to 7.8-fold in Category II-IV), and other adverse perinatal outcomes increase with disease severity, particularly with laboratory abnormalities and severe clinical signs.\nCONCLUSION: The frequency of abnormal laboratory values in women with pregnancy-associated hypertension increases with disease severity. Adverse perinatal outcomes increase in the presence of abnormal laboratory values, particularly in those with clinical signs, likely atttributable in part to the decision to deliver early.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

(ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02105688).\nSETTING: Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Israel, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\nPATIENTS: 301 treatment-naive patients with chronic HCV genotype 1, 4, or 6 infection who were at least 80% adherent to visits for opioid agonist therapy (OAT).\nINTERVENTION: The immediate-treatment group (ITG) received elbasvir-grazoprevir for 12 weeks; the deferred-treatment group (DTG) received placebo for 12 weeks, no treatment for 4 weeks, then open-label elbasvir-grazoprevir for 12 weeks.\nMEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was sustained virologic response at 12 weeks (SVR12), evaluated separately in the ITG and DTG. Other outcomes included SVR24, viral recurrence or reinfection, and adverse events.\nRESULTS: The SVR12 was 91.5% (95% CI, 86.8% to 95.0%) in the ITG and 89.5% (95% CI, 81.5% to 94.8%) in the active phase of the DTG. Drug use at baseline and during treatment did not affect SVR12 or adherence to HCV therapy. Among 18 patients with posttreatment viral recurrence through 24-week follow-up, 6 had probable reinfection. If the probable reinfections were assumed to be responses, SVR12 was 94.0% (CI, 89.8% to 96.9%) in the ITG. One patient in the ITG (1 of 201) and 1 in the placebo-phase DTG (1 of 100) discontinued treatment because of an adverse event.\nLIMITATION: These findings may not be generalizable to PWID who are not receiving OAT, nor do they apply to persons with genotype 3 infection, a common strain in PWID.\nCONCLUSION: Patients with HCV infection who were receiving OAT and treated with elbasvir-grazoprevir had high rates of SVR12, regardless of ongoing drug use. These results support the removal of drug use as a barrier to interferon-free HCV treatment for patients receiving OAT.\nPRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: Merck & Co.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

This facilitates glucose and insulin delivery to muscle, thus augmenting glucose uptake. In obese rats, both insulin-mediated microvascular recruitment and glucose uptake are diminished; however, this action of insulin has not been studied in obese humans. Here we used contrast ultrasound to measure microvascular blood volume (MBV) (an index of microvascular recruitment) in the forearm flexor muscles of lean and obese adults before and after a 120-min euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic (1 mU . min(-1) . kg(-1)) clamp. We also measured brachial artery flow, fasting lipid profile, and anthropomorphic variables. Fasting plasma glucose (5.4 +/- 0.1 vs. 5.1 +/- 0.1 mmol/l, P = 0.05), insulin (79 +/- 11 vs. 38 +/- 6 pmol/l, P = 0.003), and percent body fat (44 +/- 2 vs. 25 +/- 2%, P = 0.001) were higher in the obese than the lean adults. After 2 h of insulin infusion, whole-body glucose infusion rate was significantly lower in the obese versus lean group (19.3 +/- 3.2 and 37.4 +/- 2.6 mumol . min(-1) . kg(-1) respectively, P < 0.001). Compared with baseline, insulin increased MBV in the lean (18.7 +/- 3.3 to 25.0 +/- 4.1, P = 0.019) but not in the obese group (20.4 +/- 3.6 to 18.8 +/- 3.8, NS). Insulin increased brachial artery diameter and flow in the lean but not in the obese group. We observed a significant, negative correlation between DeltaMBV and BMI (R = -0.482, P = 0.027) in response to insulin. In conclusion, obesity eliminated the insulin-stimulated muscle microvascular recruitment and increased brachial artery blood flow seen in lean individuals.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

The working group identified the immediate need for a common definition and thus developed the clinical definition in this report.\nMAJOR CONCEPTS IN THE DEFINITION: The major concept is that TRALI is defined as new acute lung injury occurring during or within 6 hrs after a transfusion, with a clear temporal relationship to the transfusion. Also, another important concept is that acute lung injury temporally associated with multiple transfusions can be TRALI, because each unit of blood or blood component can carry one or more of the possible causative agents: antileukocyte antibody, biologically active substances, and other yet unidentified agents.\nRECOMMENDATION: Using the definition in this report, clinicians can diagnose and report TRALI cases to the blood bank; importantly, researchers can use this definition to determine incidence, pathophysiology, and strategies to prevent this leading cause of transfusion-associated mortality.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

The protocol included a 2-week baseline sensor-augmented pump (SAP) period followed by 2 weeks of overnight-only CLC and 2 weeks of 24/7 CLC at home. Glucose control during CLC was compared with the baseline SAP.\nRESULTS: Glycemic control parameters for overnight-only CLC were improved during the nighttime period compared with baseline for hypoglycemia (time <70 mg/dL, primary end point median 1.1% vs. 3.0%; P < 0.001), time in target (70-180 mg/dL: 75% vs. 61%; P < 0.001), and glucose variability (coefficient of variation: 30% vs. 36%; P < 0.001).

We tested the effects of cognitive rehabilitation in these patients using the Attention Process Training-II (APT-II) program in a single-blinded, randomized clinical trial.\nMETHODS: Patients were randomized to APT-II or standard care and evaluated at baseline, 6, and 12 months with functional, quality of life, cognitive tests, and resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI).\nRESULTS: Forty-six patients were enrolled and 43 (mean\u00b1SD age 75.1\u00b16.8) completed the study. No change was seen in functionality and quality of life between treated and non-treated patients. However, the Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test immediate recall showed a significant improvement in treated compared to non-treated group (change score 6 versus 12 months: 1.8\u00b14.9 and -1.4\u00b13.8, p\u200a=\u200a0.021; baseline versus 12 months: 3.8\u00b16.1 and 0.2\u00b14.4, p\u200a=\u200a0.032). A higher proportion of treated patients had stable/better evaluation compared to non-treated group on Visual search test (6 versus 12 months: 95% versus 71%, p\u200a=\u200a0.038) and Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure copy (6 versus 12 months: 95% versus 67%, p\u200a=\u200a0.027).

Baseline to Week 24\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Agitation and aggression in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are amongst the most serious of neuropsychiatric symptoms, and contribute to poor outcomes and worse quality of life. Previous studies have suggested a benefit for memantine on agitation and aggression, but none have examined its efficacy in community-dwelling patients with significant agitation and aggression at baseline, utilizing these behaviors as a primary outcome measure.\nMETHODS: Patients with moderate-to-severe AD with Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) total score \u226513 and NPI agitation/aggression score \u22651 were randomized to placebo or 20-mg memantine in a double-blind, 24-week trial. Co-primary outcome measures were behavior, measured by total NPI score, and cognition, using the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB). Secondary outcome measures included global assessment, function and other measures of behavior. This trial was registered as Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00857649.\nRESULTS: A total of 369 patients (average age = 75, average MMSE = 12) were randomized to placebo or memantine. The study was prematurely terminated due to recruitment problems. There were no statistically significant differences between memantine and placebo in mean change from baseline in NPI, SIB, or any of the secondary outcome measures. Behavior improved in both groups (total NPI change scores -3.90 \u00b1 1.24 for memantine and -5.13 \u00b1 1.23 for placebo). Memantine was generally well tolerated and patient retention in both treatment arms was good.\nCONCLUSIONS: The study failed to show the superiority of memantine in this sample of patients with moderate-to-severe AD with significant baseline agitation and aggression. Methodological limitations could have contributed to these results.\n## Response:\nFALSE"}

This study investigated whether cigarette demand predicted response to contingent monetary rewards for abstinence among individuals with substance use disorders. It also sought to replicate evidence for greater price sensitivity at whole-dollar pack price transitions (ie, left-digit effects).\nMETHODS: Participants (N = 338) were individuals in residential substance use disorder treatment who participated in a randomized controlled trial that compared contingent vouchers to noncontingent vouchers for smoking abstinence. Baseline demand indices were used to predict number of abstinent days during the 14-day voucher period (after the reduction lead-in) and at 1 and 3 months afterward.\nRESULTS: Demand indices correlated with measures of smoking and nicotine dependence. As measured by elasticity, intensity and O max, higher demand significantly predicted fewer abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings during voucher period for individuals in the noncontingent vouchers condition. Breakpoint exhibited a trend-level association with abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings. Demand indices did not predict abstinence in the contingent vouchers group, and did not predict abstinence at 1- and 3-month follow-ups. Left-digit price transitions were associated with significantly greater reductions in consumption.\nCONCLUSIONS: The association of cigarette demand with smoking behavior only in the group for whom abstinence was not incentivized indicates that CPT assesses the value of smoking more than the value of money per se and that vouchers counteract the effects of the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes. Results provide initial short-term evidence of predictive validity for the CPT indices.\nIMPLICATIONS: This study provides the first evidence of the validity of the CPT for predicting early response to brief advice for smoking cessation plus nicotine replacement in smokers with substance dependence. However, demand for cigarettes did not predict voucher-based treatment response, indicating that incentives serve as a powerful motivator not to smoke that acts in opposition to the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes and that the indices reflect the value of smoking more than the value of money per se.\n## Response:\nFALSE"}

However, this association in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) remains controversial prompting the need for investigation into the role of O3FAs on serum lipids and vascular inflammation markers. The present meta-analysis summarized the effects of O3FA supplementation on serum lipids and vascular inflammatory markers in patients with ESRD. PubMed, EmBase, and the Cochrane Library were searched to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) focused on serum lipids and vascular inflammation markers in patients with ESRD. Standard mean differences (SMD) were used to measure the effect of O3FA supplementation on serum lipids and vascular inflammatory markers. The final pooled analysis included 20 RCTs involving 1,461 patients with ESRD. The results indicated that O3FA supplementation reduced TG by 0.61, LDL by 0.35 and CRP by 0.56. However, O3FA had no significant effect on TC, HDL, albumin, hemoglobin, homocysteine, DBP, glucose, lipoprotein(a), and ferritin. O3FA supplementation is associated with lower several serum lipids and vascular inflammation markers in patients with ESRD.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Aureus Colonization During a Typical 10-hour Work Day 10-hour work day\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Antibiotics used to reduce nasal colonization by Staphylococcus aureus in patients before admission are inappropriate for carriage reduction on a regular basis within a hospital community. Effective nonantibiotic alternatives for daily use in the nares will allow reduction of this bacterial source to be addressed.\nMETHODS: Our study tested the effectiveness of a nonantibiotic, alcohol-based antiseptic in reducing nasal bacterial carriage in health care professionals (HCPs) at an urban hospital center. HCPs testing positive for vestibular S aureus colonization were treated 3 times during the day with topical antiseptic or control preparations. Nasal S aureus and total bacterial colonization levels were determined before and at the end of a 10-hour workday.\nRESULTS: Seventy-eight of 387 HCPs screened (20.2%) tested positive for S aureus infection. Of 39 subjects who tested positive for S aureus infection who completed the study, 20 received antiseptic and 19 received placebo treatment. Antiseptic treatment reduced S aureus colony forming units from baseline by 99% (median) and 82% (mean) (P < .001). Total bacterial colony forming units were reduced by 91% (median) and 71% (mean) (P < .001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Nasal application of a nonantibiotic, alcohol-based antiseptic was effective in reducing S aureus and total bacterial carriage, suggesting the usefulness of this approach as a safe, effective, and convenient alternative to antibiotic treatment.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

Adherence (percentage of doses taken as prescribed) was calculated for both the day and the week preceding each of 6 research visits. Mean self-reported 1-day adherence was 79% (median, 86%), and mean self-reported 1-week adherence was 78% (median, 85%). Mean MEMS 1-day adherence was 57% (median, 52%), and mean MEMS 1-week adherence was 53% (median, 49%). One-day and 1-week estimates were highly correlated (r>.8 for both measures). Both self-reported and MEMS adherence were correlated with concurrent HIV load (r=.43-.60), but the likelihood of achieving virologic suppression was greater if MEMS adherence was high than if self-reported adherence was high. We conclude that self-reported adherence is higher than MEMS adherence, but a strong relationship exists between both measures and virus load. However, electronic monitoring is more sensitive than self-report for the detection of nonadherence and should be used in adherence intervention studies.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Efficacy effect size (ES) was estimated using Hedges's standardized mean difference. Safety was measured via the risk ratio (RR) of patients having at least one episode of diarrhoea, or withdrawal due to adverse events. Trials were combined by using random-effects meta-analysis. Consistency was evaluated via the I-squared index.\nRESULTS: Six trials (seven sub-studies; 1533 patients) contributed to the meta-analysis, revealing a large degree of inconsistency among the trials (I(2)=56%) in regard to pain reduction: the combined ES was -0.24 [95% confidence intervals (CI): -0.39 to -0.08, P=0.003], favouring diacerein. The statistically significant improvement in function (P=0.01) was based on a small amount of heterogeneity (I(2)=11%), but presented a questionable clinical effect size (ES=-0.14). Risk of publication bias could not be excluded, and trials with duration of more than 6 months did not favour diacerein. There was an increased risk of diarrhoea with diacerein (RR=3.51 [2.55-4.83], P<0.0001), and some withdrawal from therapy following adverse events (RR=1.58 [1.05-2.36], P=0.03).\nCONCLUSIONS: Diacerein may be an alternative therapy for OA for patients who cannot take paracetamol or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) because of adverse effects or lack of benefit.

In this trial, we assessed the efficacy and safety of nerinetide in human ischaemia-reperfusion that occurs with rapid endovascular thrombectomy in patients who had an acute ischaemic stroke.\nMETHODS: For this multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study done in 48 acute care hospitals in eight countries, we enrolled patients with acute ischaemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion within a 12 h treatment window. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with a disabling ischaemic stroke at the time of randomisation, had been functioning independently in the community before the stroke, had an Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) greater than 4, and vascular imaging showing moderate-to-good collateral filling, as determined by multiphase CT angiography. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous nerinetide in a single dose of 2\u00b76 mg/kg, up to a maximum dose of 270 mg, on the basis of estimated or actual weight (if known) or saline placebo by use of a real-time, dynamic, internet-based, stratified randomised minimisation procedure. Patients were stratified by intravenous alteplase treatment and declared endovascular device choice. All trial personnel and patients were masked to sequence and treatment allocation. All patients underwent endovascular thrombectomy and received alteplase in usual care when indicated. The primary outcome was a favourable functional outcome 90 days after randomisation, defined as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-2. Secondary outcomes were measures of neurological disability, functional independence in activities of daily living, excellent functional outcome (mRS 0-1), and mortality. The analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population and adjusted for age, sex, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, ASPECTS, occlusion location, site, alteplase use, and declared first device. The safety population included all patients who received any amount of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02930018.\nFINDINGS: Between March 1, 2017, and Aug 12, 2019, 1105 patients were randomly assigned to receive nerinetide (n=549) or placebo (n=556). 337 (61\u00b74%) of 549 patients with nerinetide and 329 (59\u00b72%) of 556 with placebo achieved an mRS score of 0-2 at 90 days (adjusted risk ratio 1\u00b704, 95% CI 0\u00b796-1\u00b714; p=0\u00b735). Secondary outcomes were similar between groups. We observed evidence of treatment effect modification resulting in inhibition of treatment effect in patients receiving alteplase. Serious adverse events occurred equally between groups.\nINTERPRETATION: Nerinetide did not improve the proportion of patients achieving good clinical outcomes after endovascular thrombectomy compared with patients receiving placebo.\nFUNDING: Canadian Institutes for Health Research, Alberta Innovates, and NoNO.\n## Response:\nFALSE"}

We evaluated oral immunotherapy using egg-white powder for the treatment of children with egg allergy.\nMETHODS: In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, 55 children, 5 to 11 years of age, with egg allergy received oral immunotherapy (40 children) or placebo (15). Initial dose-escalation, build-up, and maintenance phases were followed by an oral food challenge with egg-white powder at 10 months and at 22 months. Children who successfully passed the challenge at 22 months discontinued oral immunotherapy and avoided all egg consumption for 4 to 6 weeks. At 24 months, these children underwent an oral food challenge with egg-white powder and a cooked egg to test for sustained unresponsiveness. Children who passed this challenge at 24 months were placed on a diet with ad libitum egg consumption and were evaluated for continuation of sustained unresponsiveness at 30 months and 36 months.\nRESULTS: After 10 months of therapy, none of the children who received placebo and 55% of those who received oral immunotherapy passed the oral food challenge and were considered to be desensitized; after 22 months, 75% of children in the oral-immunotherapy group were desensitized. In the oral-immunotherapy group, 28% (11 of 40 children) passed the oral food challenge at 24 months and were considered to have sustained unresponsiveness. At 30 months and 36 months, all children who had passed the oral food challenge at 24 months were consuming egg. Of the immune markers measured, small wheal diameters on skin-prick testing and increases in egg-specific IgG4 antibody levels were associated with passing the oral food challenge at 24 months.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results show that oral immunotherapy can desensitize a high proportion of children with egg allergy and induce sustained unresponsiveness in a clinically significant subset.

Static IMRT plans using five and seven equiangular-spaced beams were generated. The starting gantry angles were incremented by 5 degrees resulting in 15 (5 beams) and 11 (7 beams) plans per patient. Constant target coverage was ensured for all plans in order to isolate the variation in the rectal and bladder metrics as a function of starting gantry angle.\nRESULTS: The variation with starting gantry angle in rectal metrics using 5 beams was statistically significant (p<0.001) with dosimetric importance. The 5-beam rectal V 75Gy and V 70Gy demonstrated a class solution with a characteristic 'W' pattern and two optimal starting gantry angles near 20 degrees and 50 degrees . Statistically insignificant differences were observed for the bladder metrics using 5 beams. There was little dosimetric variation in the rectal and bladder metrics with 7 beams. Nearly equivalent rectal V 75Gy was achieved between 5 optimal equiangular-spaced beams starting at 20 degrees (class solution) and 7 equiangular-spaced beams starting at 0 degrees for most patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: The use of an optimal starting gantry angle for 5 equiangular-spaced beams, as indicated by a class solution in this study, will facilitate rectal sparing and can produce plans that are equivalent to those employing 7 equiangular-spaced beams.\n## Response:\nFALSE"}

Laser intervention was performed using Ho:YAG laser system. The results were quantitatively analysed by measuring areal changes of the herniated mass on axial T1-weighted images and signal changes within the disc on sagittal T2-weighted images. Clinical outcomes were evaluated according to Japanese Orthopaedic Association score (JOA score), and recovery rates based on JOA score immediately and 1 year after treatment were calculated.\nRESULTS: The recovery rate immediately after treatment was 53.1%, and increasing to 64.6% 1 year later. The size of the disc herniation ranged from 7% to 55% of the axial cross-section of the spinal canal pre-operatively and no significant changes were noted postoperatively. Also no correlation was found between the pre-operative herniation size and the recovery rate. The signal changes within the disc increased significantly after treatment, but no correlation was present between the signal changes and the recovery rate. In five patients, soft-tissue changes along the laser tract were well demonstrated on MR imaging.\nCONCLUSION: Although immediate postoperative MR imaging shows early tissue changes induced by laser, our study has not proven that immediate postoperative MR imaging could predict the clinical outcome after percutaneous laser discectomy.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the tissue integration of intentionally non-submerged titanium implants inserted by a one-stage surgical procedure. 100 ITI implants were consecutively placed in 70 partially edentulous patients. After a healing period free of masticatory loading for at least 3 months, the implants were examined. The clinical status showed for all implants neither detectable mobility nor signs of a peri-implant infection. Therefore, prosthetic abutments were inserted, and the patients were restored with fixed partial dentures. All patients were regularly recalled at 3-month intervals, and no patient dropped out of the study. Thus, all 100 implants were re-evaluated 12 months following implantation. Plaque- and sulcus bleeding indices, probing depth, clinical attachment level, width of keratinized mucosa, and periotest scores were assessed. In addition, standardized radiographs were analyzed for the presence of peri-implant radiolucencies and for the location of alveolar bone levels around the implants. Based on predefined criteria, the implants were classified as successful or failing. 98 implants were considered successful, and 1 implant failing. The remaining implant exhibited a peri-implant infection requiring local and systemic antimicrobial treatment. The results of this short-term study indicate that intentionally non-submerged ITI implants yield a high predictability for successful tissue integration.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

Interventions Filler and vehicle (isotonic sodium chloride) injected into forearm skin and skin biopsy specimens taken 4 and 13 weeks later.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: De novo synthesis of collagen, the major structural protein of dermal extracellular matrix, was assessed using immunohistochemical analysis, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and electron microscopy.\nRESULTS: Compared with controls, immunostaining in skin receiving cross-linked hyaluronic acid injections revealed increased collagen deposition around the filler. Staining for prolyl-4-hydroxylase and the C-terminal and N-terminal epitopes of type I procollagen was enhanced at 4 and 13 weeks after treatment (P<.05). Gene expression for types I and III procollagen as well as several profibrotic growth factors was also up-regulated at 4 and 13 weeks compared with controls (P<.05). Fibroblasts in filler-injected skin demonstrated a mechanically stretched appearance and a biosynthetic phenotype. In vitro, fibroblasts did not bind the filler, suggesting that cross-linked hyaluronic acid is not directly stimulatory.\nCONCLUSIONS: Injection of cross-linked hyaluronic acid stimulates collagen synthesis, partially restoring dermal matrix components that are lost in photodamaged skin. We hypothesize that this stimulatory effect may be induced by mechanical stretching of the dermis, which in turn leads to stretching and activation of dermal fibroblasts. These findings imply that cross-linked hyaluronic acid may be useful for stimulating collagen production therapeutically, particularly in the setting of atrophic skin conditions.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Patients were eligible for enrollment if they were not receiving treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension or if they were receiving a stable dose of an endothelin-receptor antagonist, a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, or both. The primary end point was a composite of death from any cause or a complication related to pulmonary arterial hypertension up to the end of the treatment period (defined for each patient as 7 days after the date of the last intake of selexipag or placebo).\nRESULTS: A primary end-point event occurred in 397 patients--41.6% of those in the placebo group and 27.0% of those in the selexipag group (hazard ratio in the selexipag group as compared with the placebo group, 0.60; 99% confidence interval, 0.46 to 0.78; P<0.001). Disease progression and hospitalization accounted for 81.9% of the events. The effect of selexipag with respect to the primary end point was similar in the subgroup of patients who were not receiving treatment for the disease at baseline and in the subgroup of patients who were already receiving treatment at baseline (including those who were receiving a combination of two therapies). By the end of the study, 105 patients in the placebo group and 100 patients in the selexipag group had died from any cause. Overall, 7.1% of patients in the placebo group and 14.3% of patients in the selexipag group discontinued their assigned regimen prematurely because of adverse events. The most common adverse events in the selexipag group were consistent with the known side effects of prostacyclin, including headache, diarrhea, nausea, and jaw pain.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, the risk of the primary composite end point of death or a complication related to pulmonary arterial hypertension was significantly lower with selexipag than with placebo. There was no significant difference in mortality between the two study groups. (Funded by Actelion Pharmaceuticals; GRIPHON ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01106014.).\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

The primary outcome was the change from baseline to cycle 6 for all indices.\nRESULTS: All parameters were similar at baseline between the two groups. Over six cycles, NOMAC/E2 had less effect on most haemostatic indices than LNG/EE. Lipids were essentially unchanged with NOMAC/E2, whereas with LNG/EE high-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides slightly increased. NOMAC/E2 induced negligible changes in glucose and insulin parameters, in contrast to LNG/EE. A much smaller increase in CRP was observed with NOMAC/E2 than with LNG/EE.

The two families of acids are metabolized by the same enzymes, making them competitive. Gross deficiencies of omega 6 plus omega 3 EFA have been observed in humans, induced by attempts at total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with preparations devoid of lipids. Deficiency of omega 3 acids has been induced by TPN containing high omega 6 and low omega 3 fatty acids. In natural human populations, a wide range of omega 3 and omega 6 proportions have been found, ranging from high omega 3 and low omega 6 content to low omega 3 and high omega 6 content, showing inverse correlation between sigma omega 6 and sigma omega 3. In humans with neuropathy or impairment of the immune system, significant deficits of omega 3 EFA have been measured.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Time points of measurement: 4 hours after ROSC.\nAbstract: Using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and the tracer indocyanine green (ICG), we quantified blood flow in calf muscle and around the Achilles tendon during plantar flexion (1-9 W). For comparison, blood flow in calf muscle was determined by dye dilution in combination with magnetic resonance imaging measures of muscle volume, and, for the peritendon region, blood flow was measured by (133)Xe washout. From rest to a peak load of 9 W, NIRS-ICG blood flow in calf muscle increased from 2.4+/-0.2 to 74+/-5 ml x 100 ml tissue(-1) x min(-1), similar to that measured by reverse dye (77+/-6 ml x 100 ml tissue(-1) x min(-1)). Achilles peritendon blood flow measured by NIRS-ICG rose with exercise from 2.2+/-0.5 to 15.1+/-0.2 ml x 100 ml(-1) x min(-1), which was similar to that determined by (133)Xe washout (2.0+/-0.6 to 14.6+/-0.3 ml x 100 ml tissue(-1) x min(-1)). This is the first study using NIRS and ICG to quantify regional tissue blood flow during exercise in humans. Due to its high spatial and temporal resolution, the technique may be useful for determining regional blood flow distribution and regulation during exercise in humans.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Here we examined the effectiveness of single-session informational counseling with single-session performance-perceptual counseling.\nDESIGN: Two forms of counseling were compared: informational counseling (IC) and performance-perceptual counseling (PPC). IC focused on discussing communication strategies and tips for hearing-aid use. PPC addressed the discrepancy between measured and perceived ability to understand speech. Outcomes were measured eight-to-ten weeks post-counseling using quantitative and qualitative measures: Hearing handicap inventory, abbreviated profile of hearing aid benefit, psychosocial impact of assistive devices scale (PIADS), international outcome inventory for hearing aids, and a semi-structured exit interview.\nSTUDY SAMPLE: Seventy-four hearing aid-users with symmetrical sensorineural hearing loss participated.\nRESULTS: Scores on the hearing questionnaires showed no change following either form of counseling. Scores on the PIADS improved for participants as a whole, and the semi-structured interview revealed increased hearing-aid use, better understanding and acceptance of hearing loss, increased use of communication strategies, and improved ability to explain hearing difficulties to others.\nCONCLUSIONS: A single session of hearing-aid counseling can improve hearing-aid use and satisfaction.

Fifty adult (study p520, aged 16-44 years) and 49 paediatric patients (study p521, 4-15 years) with recent-onset T1D were treated subcutaneously at four different time points with 0.2 mg or 1.0 mg DiaPep277 versus placebo and followed for 18 months. Adult patients were treated with 0.2 mg, 1.0 mg or 2.5 mg DiaPep277 versus placebo. Stimulated C-peptide served as readout for functional beta-cell-mass.\nRESULTS: DiaPep277-treatment was not associated with severe side effects. No differences were found in placebo and DiaPep277 treated groups. In adults, a modest trend towards better maintenance of beta-cell function was observed in the 0.2 mg and 1.0 mg group, while there was significant loss of stimulated C-peptide in the placebo and 2.5 mg group.

Despite similar stimulated C-peptide levels at baseline, children exhibited a more pronounced loss of beta-cell function over 18 months than adults (p = 0.0003).\nCONCLUSION: Administration of DiaPep277 seems safe and may have beneficial effects on C-peptide levels over time in some patients with T1D, but this finding was not accompanied by reduced HbA1c or insulin requirement. Studies with more patients and longer follow-up are needed to further study the effect of DiaPep277.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Week 12\nAbstract: AIM(S): This study assessed the effect of differences in renal function on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of dapagliflozin, a renal sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).\nMETHODS: A single 50 mg dose of dapagliflozin was used to assess pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in five groups: healthy non-diabetic subjects; patients with T2DM and normal kidney function and patients with T2DM and mild, moderate or severe renal impairment based on estimated creatinine clearance. Subsequently, 20 mg once daily multiple doses of dapagliflozin were evaluated in the patients with T2DM. Formation rates of dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide (D3OG), an inactive metabolite, were evaluated using human isolated kidney and liver microsomes.\nRESULTS: Plasma concentrations of dapagliflozin and D3OG were incrementally increased with declining kidney function. Steady-state Cmax for dapagliflozin were 4%, 6% and 9% higher and for D3OG were 20%, 37% and 52% higher in patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, respectively, compared with normal function. AUC(0,\u03c4) was likewise higher. D3OG formation in kidney microsomes was three-fold higher than in liver microsomes and 109-fold higher than in intestine microsomes. Compared with patients with normal renal function, pharmacodynamic effects were attenuated with renal impairment. Steady-state renal glucose clearance was reduced by 42%, 83% and 84% in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that both kidney and liver significantly contribute to dapagliflozin metabolism, resulting in higher systemic exposure with declining kidney function. Dapagliflozin pharmacodynamics in diabetic subjects with moderate to severe renal impairment are consistent with the observation of reduced efficacy in this patient population.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the association between air pollution and acute decompensated heart failure including hospitalisation and heart failure mortality.\nMETHODS: Five databases were searched for studies investigating the association between daily increases in gaseous (carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone) and particulate (diameter <2\u00b75 \u03bcm [PM2\u00b75] or <10 \u03bcm [PM10]) air pollutants, and heart failure hospitalisations or heart failure mortality. We used a random-effects model to derive overall risk estimates per pollutant.\nFINDINGS: Of 1146 identified articles, 195 were reviewed in-depth with 35 satisfying inclusion criteria. Heart failure hospitalisation or death was associated with increases in carbon monoxide (3\u00b752% per 1 part per million; 95% CI 2\u00b752-4\u00b754), sulphur dioxide (2\u00b736% per 10 parts per billion; 1\u00b735-3\u00b738), and nitrogen dioxide (1\u00b770% per 10 parts per billion; 1\u00b725-2\u00b716), but not ozone (0\u00b746% per 10 parts per billion; -0\u00b710 to 1\u00b702) concentrations. Increases in particulate matter concentration were associated with heart failure hospitalisation or death (PM2\u00b75 2\u00b712% per 10 \u03bcg/m(3), 95% CI 1\u00b742-2\u00b782; PM10 1\u00b763% per 10 \u03bcg/m(3), 95% CI 1\u00b720-2\u00b707). Strongest associations were seen on the day of exposure, with more persistent effects for PM2\u00b75. In the USA, we estimate that a mean reduction in PM2\u00b75 of 3\u00b79 \u03bcg/m(3) would prevent 7978 heart failure hospitalisations and save a third of a billion US dollars a year.\nINTERPRETATION: Air pollution has a close temporal association with heart failure hospitalisation and heart failure mortality. Although more studies from developing nations are required, air pollution is a pervasive public health issue with major cardiovascular and health economic consequences, and it should remain a key target for global health policy.\nFUNDING: British Heart Foundation.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

The Philips Allura FD20 system allows switching between the reference (Allura Xper) and the novel X-ray imaging technology (Allura Clarity). Primary end-point was overall procedural patient dose, expressed in dose area product (DAP) and air kerma (AK). Operator dose, procedural success, and necessity to switch to higher dose settings were secondary end-points.\nRESULTS: A total of 136 patients were randomly assigned to the novel imaging group (n = 68) or the reference group (n = 68). Baseline characteristics were similar, except patients in the novel imaging group were younger (58 vs 65 years, P < .01). Median DAP and AK were 43% and 40% lower in the novel imaging group, respectively (P < .0001). A 50% operator dose reduction was achieved in the novel imaging group (P < .001). Fluoroscopy time, number of exposure frames, and procedure duration were equivalent between the two groups, indicating that the image quality was similarly adequate in both groups. Procedural success was achieved in 91% of patients in both groups; one pericardial tamponade occurred in the novel imaging group.\nCONCLUSION: The novel imaging technology, Allura Clarity, significantly reduces patient and operator dose in complex EP procedures while maintaining image quality.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

No good biomarkers exist to monitor the effect of stromal targeting therapies or to predict response. We set out to identify such non-invasive markers for PDAC stroma and predict response to therapy. Gene expression datasets, co-culture experiments, xenografts, and patient samples were analyzed. Serum samples were measured from a cohort of 58 resected patients, and 87 metastatic or locally advanced PDAC patients. Baseline and follow-up levels were assessed in 372 additional metastatic PDAC patients who received nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine (n\u2009=\u2009184) or gemcitabine monotherapy (n\u2009=\u2009188) in the phase III MPACT trial. Increased levels of ADAM12 were found in PDAC patients compared to healthy controls (p\u2009<\u20090.0001, n\u2009=\u2009157 and n\u2009=\u200938). High levels of ADAM12 significantly associated with poor outcome in resected PDAC (HR 2.07, p\u2009=\u20090.04). In the MPACT trial survival was significantly longer for patients who received nab-paclitaxel and had undetectable ADAM12 levels before treatment (OS 12.3\u2009m vs 7.9\u2009m p\u2009=\u20090.0046). Consistently undetectable or decreased ADAM12 levels during treatment significantly associated with longer survival as well (OS 14.4\u2009m and 11.2\u2009m, respectively vs 8.3, p\u2009=\u20090.0054). We conclude that ADAM12 is a blood-borne proxy for stromal activation, the levels of which have prognostic significance and correlate with treatment benefit.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Each subject received a 75-g OGTT and a euglycemic insulin clamp in combination with tritiated glucose. The OGTT-derived indexes of muscle and hepatic insulin sensitivity were compared with hepatic and muscle insulin sensitivity, which was directly measured with the insulin clamp, by correlation analysis.\nRESULTS: The product of total area under curve (AUC) for glucose and insulin during the first 30 min of the OGTT (glucose(0-30)[AUC] x insulin(0-30)[AUC]) strongly correlated with the hepatic insulin resistance index (fasting plasma insulin x basal endogenous glucose production) (r = 0.64, P < 0.0001). The rate of decay of plasma glucose concentration from its peak value to its nadir during the OGTT divided by the mean plasma insulin concentration (dG/dt / I) strongly correlated with muscle insulin sensitivity measured with the insulin clamp (P = 0.78, P < 0.0001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Novel estimates for hepatic and muscle insulin resistance from OGTT data are presented for quantitation of insulin sensitivity in nondiabetic subjects.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Study treatments were 400 mg of oral moxifloxacin or a matching placebo daily for 5 days. The primary end point was clinical response at test-of-cure, 1 to 3 days after the end of therapy in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population (patients with positive culture for one of five prespecified pathogens). Secondary efficacy variables included patient-reported symptom improvement measured using the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-16 (SNOT-16), and concomitant medication use.\nRESULTS: The mITT population consisted of 118 patients (moxifloxacin, n = 73; placebo, n = 45). Clinical success rates were numerically higher for moxifloxacin (78.1%, 57/73) versus placebo (66.7%, 30/45); (P = .189). Significantly greater mean reductions in SNOT-16 scores occurred in moxifloxacin- versus placebo-treated patients (-17.54 vs. -12.83; P = .032). Overall concomitant medication use was lower in moxifloxacin versus placebo patients (38.4%, 28/73 vs. 55.6%, 25/45 respectively). Premature discontinuation due to insufficient therapeutic effect was significantly lower in moxifloxacin- versus placebo-treated patients (8.2%, 6/73 vs. 22.2%, 10/45; P = .031). The rate of treatment-emergent adverse events in the ITT population was similar between arms (moxifloxacin 38.2%, 96/251; placebo 40.7%, 50/123).\nCONCLUSIONS: Although moxifloxacin 5-day therapy for ABRS was not statistically superior to placebo for the primary end point, patients who received moxifloxacin had significantly greater improvements in health outcomes and used fewer concomitant medicines than patients treated with placebo, while experiencing no increase in adverse events.\n## Response:\nFALSE"}

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an effective adjuvant therapy but still not ideal. Intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation (iTBS), which has only been used recently in clinical practice, could have a faster and more intense effect compared to conventional protocols, including 10-Hz high-frequency rTMS (HF-rTMS). However, no controlled study has so far highlighted the superiority of iTBS in resistant unipolar depression.\nMETHODS/DESIGN: This paper focuses on the design of a randomised, controlled, double-blind, single-centre study with two parallel arms, carried out in France, in an attempt to assess the efficacy of an iTBS protocol versus a standard HF- rTMS protocol. Sixty patients aged between 18 and 75\u00a0years of age will be enrolled. They must be diagnosed with major depressive disorder persisting despite treatment with two antidepressants at an effective dose over a period of 6\u00a0weeks during the current episode. The study will consist of two phases: a treatment phase comprising 20 sessions of rTMS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, localised via a neuronavigation system and a 6-month longitudinal follow-up. The primary endpoint will be the number of responders per group, defined by a decrease of at least 50% in the initial score on the Montgomery and Asberg Rating Scale (MADRS) at the end of rTMS sessions. The secondary endpoints will be: response rate 1\u00a0month after rTMS sessions; number of remissions defined by a MADRS score of <8 at the endpoint and 1\u00a0month after; the number of responses and remissions maintained over the next 6\u00a0months; quality of life; and the presence of predictive markers of the therapeutic response: clinical (dimensional scales), neuropsychological (evaluation of cognitive functions), motor (objective motor testing) and neurophysiological (cortical excitability measurements).\nDISCUSSION: The purpose of our study is to check the assumption of iTBS superiority in the management of unipolar depression and we will discuss its effect over time. In case of a significant increase in the number of therapeutic responses with a prolonged effect, the iTBS protocol could be considered a first-line protocol in resistant unipolar depression.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, Identifier NCT02376491 .

Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4) inhibitors are glucose-lowering medications with pleiotropic actions that may particularly benefit people with HIV, but the immune and virological safety of DPP4 inhibition in HIV is unknown.\nOBJECTIVE: DPP4 inhibition will not reduce CD4+ T lymphocyte number or increase HIV viremia in HIV-positive adults.\nDESIGN: This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind safety trial of sitagliptin in HIV-positive adults.\nSETTING: The study was conducted at an academic medical center.\nPARTICIPANTS: Twenty nondiabetic HIV-positive men and women (9.8 \u00b1 5.5 years of known HIV) taking antiretroviral therapy and with stable immune (625 \u00b1 134 CD4+ T cells per microliter) and virological (<48 copies HIV RNA per milliliter) status.\nINTERVENTION: The intervention included sitagliptin (100 mg/d) vs matching placebo for up to 24 weeks.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: CD4+ T cell number and plasma HIV RNA were measured every 4 weeks; fasting serum regulated upon activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), stromal derived factor (SDF)-1\u03b1, Soluble TNF receptor II, and oral glucose tolerance were measured at baseline, week 8, and the end of study. ANOVA was used for between-group comparisons; P < .05 was considered significant.\nRESULTS: Compared with placebo, sitagliptin did not reduce CD4+ T cell count, plasma HIV RNA remained less than 48 copies/mL, RANTES and soluble TNF receptor II concentrations did not increase. SDF1\u03b1 concentrations declined (P < .0002) in the sitagliptin group. The oral glucose tolerance levels improved in the sitagliptin group at week 8.\nCONCLUSIONS: Despite lowering SDF1\u03b1 levels, sitagliptin did not adversely affect immune or virological status, or increase immune activation, but did improve glycemia in healthy, nondiabetic HIV-positive adults. These safety data allow future efficacy studies of sitagliptin in HIV-positive people with cardiometabolic complications.\n## Response:\nFALSE"}

Reported pre- to post-ART adherence between groups (k = 15) or within groups (k = 10) served as the main outcome converted to standardized ES.\nRESULTS: ART adherence interventions had a small effect (d = 0.35, odds ratio [OR] = 1.88) that varied considerably across studies. Interventions that specifically enrolled participants with known or anticipated problems with ART adherence demonstrated medium effects on adherence (d = 0.62, OR = 3.07). Interventions that did not target their participants on similar criteria had quite small effects(d = 0.19, OR = 1.41). Adherence improvements showed no tendency to decay across time.\nCONCLUSIONS: Outcomes of studies targeting those with poor ART adherence had stronger effects than those intervening with groups of individuals who were mixed in terms of pretest levels of adherence.

Sleep outcomes (sleep onset latency, total wake time, wake after sleep onset, sleep efficiency, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) were compared between CBTI and control at 6 months using repeated-measures analysis of variance adjusted for baseline values. AHI of 5 or greater versus less than 5 was included as an interaction term to evaluate changes in sleep outcomes.

Nine (45.0%) of 20 participants with mild SDB for whom insomnia was their only other indication for PAP therapy at baseline no longer had another indication for PAP at 6 months, with no significant difference between CBTI and control.\nCONCLUSIONS: CBTI improves sleep in older veterans with insomnia and untreated mild SDB.

It also lowers heart rate and blood pressure and has antiadrenergic and potential ventricular antiarrhythmic effects. We hypothesized that dronedarone would reduce major vascular events in high-risk permanent atrial fibrillation.\nMETHODS: We assigned patients who were at least 65 years of age with at least a 6-month history of permanent atrial fibrillation and risk factors for major vascular events to receive dronedarone or placebo. The first coprimary outcome was stroke, myocardial infarction, systemic embolism, or death from cardiovascular causes. The second coprimary outcome was unplanned hospitalization for a cardiovascular cause or death.\nRESULTS: After the enrollment of 3236 patients, the study was stopped for safety reasons. The first coprimary outcome occurred in 43 patients receiving dronedarone and 19 receiving placebo (hazard ratio, 2.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.34 to 3.94; P=0.002). There were 21 deaths from cardiovascular causes in the dronedarone group and 10 in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.00 to 4.49; P=0.046), including death from arrhythmia in 13 patients and 4 patients, respectively (hazard ratio, 3.26; 95% CI, 1.06 to 10.00; P=0.03).

Participants with symptom onset within 8 days were enrolled, then transfused within the subsequent day. The measured primary outcome was COVID-19-related hospitalization within 28 days of plasma transfusion. The enrollment period was June 3, 2020 to October 1, 2021.\nRESULTS: A total of 1225 participants were randomized and 1181 transfused. In the pre-specified modified intention-to-treat analysis that excluded those not transfused, the primary endpoint occurred in 37 of 589 (6.3%) who received placebo control plasma and in 17 of 592 (2.9%) participants who received convalescent plasma (relative risk, 0.46; one-sided 95% upper bound confidence interval 0.733; P=0.004) corresponding to a 54% risk reduction.

The method includes identifying the resources used in counseling, determining the true unit costs of the resources used, and calculating the total costs of counseling. Cost equations and sample calculations of total and expected costs per client in a specified time period are provided. This method of estimating costs provides a systematic application of a standard set of procedures, including sample tables and calculations. It uses the societal perspective on resource cost to determine true resource costs. This method can be used for resource allocation decisions among programs and as inputs for cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analyses. Since the method minimizes the burden of data collection and calculations, it is useful for the nonspecialist in cost analysis. The method provides a rational approach for realistic decision making and planning in public health.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

We examined whether one reason for this disparity is that women are less likely to use HAART when they have difficulty taking HIV medications openly at home.\nMETHODS: This was a prospective cohort study of a national probability sample of 2864 adults receiving HIV care.\nRESULTS: Among the 1910 people who participated in the follow-up survey and reported taking HIV medications, 11.8% reported they could not take HIV medications openly at home. Those who reported they had difficulty taking medications openly at home were more likely to be women, to be black, to live in the northeast United States, to have an annual income <5,000 US dollars, and to have no health insurance. In bivariate analysis, women had twice the odds of reporting difficulty taking medications openly (odds ratio [OR] 2.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.36-3.15) compared with gay/bisexual men, although this gender difference was no longer significant in the adjusted model. For women, having difficulty taking medications openly at home was associated with a substantial decrease in the probability of being on HAART in the adjusted model (0.59, 95% CI 0.47-0.70 vs. 0.78, 95% CI 0.74-0.83), whereas no significant differences were observed for heterosexual or gay/bisexual men.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that having difficulty taking medications openly is a barrier to antiretroviral treatment among women, but not among men, and may contribute to gender disparities in HAART use.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Coprimary end points were percent weight change and achievement of \u22655% weight loss. Secondary end points included achievement of HbA1c <7% (53 mmol/mol), achievement of weight loss \u226510%, and change in HbA1c, waist circumference, fasting blood glucose, and lipids.\nRESULTS: In the modified intent-to-treat population (54% female, 80% Caucasian, and mean age 54 years, weight 106 kg, BMI 37 kg/m(2), and HbA1c 8.0% [64 mmol/mol]), NB resulted in significantly greater weight reduction (-5.0 vs. -1.8%; P < 0.001) and proportion of patients achieving \u22655% weight loss (44.5 vs. 18.9%, P < 0.001) compared with placebo. NB also resulted in significantly greater HbA1c reduction (-0.6 vs. -0.1% [6.6 vs. 1.1 mmol/mol]; P < 0.001), percent of patients achieving HbA1c <7% (53 mmol/mol) (44.1 vs. 26.3%; P < 0.001), and improvement in triglycerides and HDL cholesterol compared with placebo. NB was associated with higher incidence of nausea (42.3 vs. 7.1%), constipation (17.7 vs. 7.1%), and vomiting (18.3 vs. 3.6%). No difference was observed between groups in the incidence of depression, suicidal ideation, or hypoglycemia.\nCONCLUSIONS: NB therapy in overweight/obese patients with type 2 diabetes induced weight loss, which was associated with improvements in glycemic control and select cardiovascular risk factors and was generally well tolerated with a safety profile similar to that in patients without diabetes.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

Current therapies for MS are only partially effective. One potential strategy to increase treatment efficacy is the combination of two or more drugs with complementary mechanisms of action, which may result in additive or synergistic therapeutic effects. In this review, we discuss the rationale and requirements and review the evidence for combination therapy in MS from in-vitro experiments, animal studies and clinical trials. Encouraging experience to date and further well-designed clinical trials with combination therapy may lead to the implementation of specific combinations of drugs in the treatment of MS.\n## Response:\nFALSE"}

Six nebulizers of each type were used to nebulize a solution of 2.5 mg (0.5 mL) albuterol with 3.5 mL of 0.9% saline. Total albuterol output and the rate of albuterol output of each device were measured until end-nebulization and for 4 min, respectively, using entrained flows from 0 to 20 L/min through the inspiratory valve of the device. Particle size distributions and the respirable fraction (RF) were evaluated by laser diffraction technique. Regression analysis of the change in rate of output and change in RF values with inspiratory flows was done to characterize each nebulizer's performance over the complete range of interest. Actual breath tracings of four CF patients were integrated with the equations specific to the in vitro performance of each nebulizer and in vivo nebulizer efficiency was calculated. The change in efficiency in vitro from 0 to 20 L/min flow, respectively, was highest for the Star (44-57%) and lowest for the Ultramist (13-15%). The mean predicted efficiency in vivo for the Star was threefold that of the Ultramist. Although all four nebulizers are breath-enhanced in design, clearly there are measurable differences in the performance and efficiency of each type. The Pari LC Star nebulizer has proven to be the nebulizer of choice among the devices tested.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Day 5, Weeks 4, 8, and 12\nAbstract: Infections by bacteria are a serious complication following orthopedic implant surgery, that can usually only be cured by removing the implant, since the biofilm mode of growth of infecting bacteria on an implant surface protects the organisms from the host immune system and antibiotic therapy. Over the past few decades, attempts have been made to prevent and cure orthopedic implant infections by incorporating antibiotics in polymethylmethacrylate bone cements, in primary and revision surgery. However, the clinical efficacy of antibiotic-releasing bone cements is not accepted by all and the long-term exposure to low doses from antibiotic-releasing bone cements in patients is strongly related to the emerging threat of antibiotic resistance in medicine today. In this article, we start by reviewing the mechanisms governing the formation of an infectious biofilm on orthopedic implant materials, the release mechanisms and properties of clinically-used, antibiotic-loaded bone cements. The clinical efficacy of antibiotic-loaded bone cements is evaluated analyzing separatedly the prophylactic and therapeutic uses of these products.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

The increase in platelet counts on day 2 and 3 was more pronounced in the high-dose group. Two patients in the high-dose group and four in the low-dose group were non-responders. Chronic disease occurred in three patients receiving 2 g/kg IVIG and in five patients receiving 0.6 g/kg IVIG. Side effects of IVIG administration were more common in the high-dose group.\nCONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that platelet counts increased more rapidly after high-dose IVIG administration within the first 72 hours, although a platelet count of more than 20x10(9)/L can be achieved also with low-dose IVIG in most children with acute ITP. For patients with very low platelet counts, doses higher than 0.6 g/kg seem, therefore, to be more effective.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

PDC was delivered via a partnership between Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Alzheimer's Association chapters, for caregivers of veterans with dementia living in the community and receiving primary care from the VA. The initial sample was 486 caregivers of 508 veterans with diagnosed dementia. Outcomes were evaluated for 394 and 324 caregivers who completed 6- and 12- month follow-up, respectively. PDC had a standardized protocol that included assessment and reassessment, action planning, and ongoing monitoring. It was delivered by telephone and e-mail for cost efficiency and the ability to handle caseloads of 100 to 125. Care coordinators from VAMCs and Alzheimer's Association chapters worked as a team using a shared computerized record. A variety of caregiver outcomes was measured after 6 and 12 months. Intervention group caregivers had significant improvements in outcomes representing unmet needs, three types of caregiver strains, depression, and two support resources. Most improvements were evident after 6 months, with more-limited improvements from Months 6 to 12. Some outcomes improved for all caregivers, whereas some improved for caregivers experiencing more initial difficulties or caring for veterans with more-severe impairments. PDC is a promising model that improves linkages between healthcare services and community services, which is a goal of several new national initiatives such as the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease and a proposed amendment to the Older Americans Act.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

We aimed to assess whether bihormonal bionic pancreas initialised only with body mass can safely reduce mean glycaemia and hypoglycaemia in adults with type 1 diabetes who were living at home and participating in their normal daily routines without restrictions on diet or physical activity.\nMETHODS: We did a random-order crossover study in volunteers at least 18 years old who had type 1 diabetes and lived within a 30 min drive of four sites in the USA. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) in blocks of two using sequentially numbered sealed envelopes to glycaemic regulation with a bihormonal bionic pancreas or usual care (conventional or sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy) first, followed by the opposite intervention. Both study periods were 11 days in length, during which time participants continued all normal activities, including athletics and driving. The bionic pancreas was initialised with only the participant's body mass. Autonomously adaptive dosing algorithms used data from a continuous glucose monitor to control subcutaneous delivery of insulin and glucagon. The coprimary outcomes were the mean glucose concentration and time with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) glucose concentration less than 3\u00b73 mmol/L, analysed over days 2-11 in participants who completed both periods of the study. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02092220.\nFINDINGS: We randomly assigned 43 participants between May 6, 2014, and July 3, 2015, 39 of whom completed the study: 20 who were assigned to bionic pancreas first and 19 who were assigned to the comparator first. The mean CGM glucose concentration was 7\u00b78 mmol/L (SD 0\u00b76) in the bionic pancreas period versus 9\u00b70 mmol/L (1\u00b76) in the comparator period (difference 1\u00b71 mmol/L, 95% CI 0\u00b77-1\u00b76; p<0\u00b70001), and the mean time with CGM glucose concentration less than 3\u00b73 mmol/L was 0\u00b76% (0\u00b76) in the bionic pancreas period versus 1\u00b79% (1\u00b77) in the comparator period (difference 1\u00b73%, 95% CI 0\u00b78-1\u00b78; p<0\u00b70001). The mean nausea score on the Visual Analogue Scale (score 0-10) was greater during the bionic pancreas period (0\u00b752 [SD 0\u00b783]) than in the comparator period (0\u00b705 [0\u00b717]; difference 0\u00b747, 95% CI 0\u00b721-0\u00b773; p=0\u00b70024). Body mass and laboratory parameters did not differ between periods. There were no serious or unexpected adverse events in the bionic pancreas period of the study.\nINTERPRETATION: Relative to conventional and sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy, the bihormonal bionic pancreas, initialised only with participant weight, was able to achieve superior glycaemic regulation without the need for carbohydrate counting. Larger and longer studies are needed to establish the long-term benefits and risks of automated glycaemic management with a bihormonal bionic pancreas.\nFUNDING: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National Institutes of Health, and National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

Patients varied in age (range: 18-102); more than half had a high school education or less (53.6%). Patient motivations for sharing access included: to help manage care (41.9%), for emergency reasons (29.7%), lack of technology experience (18.4%), or care partner request (10.0%). Care partners were parents (39.8%), adult children (27.9%), spouses (26.2%), and other relatives (6.1%). Patients were more likely than care partners to have inadequate health literacy (54.8% versus 8.8%, P < .001) and less confident in their ability to manage their care (53.0% versus 88.1%; P < .001). Care partners were more likely than patients to perform health management activities electronically (95.5% versus 48.4%; P < .001), access the patient portal (89.2% versus 30.3%; P < .001), and use patient portal functionality such as secure messaging (39.6% versus 13.9%; P < .001). Care partners used their own credentials (89.1%) and patient credentials (23.3%) to access the patient portal.\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Shared access is an underused strategy that may bridge patients' health literacy deficits and lack of technology experience and that helps but does not fully resolve concerns regarding patient and care partner identity credentials.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Thiazides act on the nephron segment distal to the ascending thick loop of Henle, that is, the site of action of loop diuretics. Blockade of sodium reabsorption in the thiazide-sensitive segment should therefore obliterate the compensatory increase in sodium reabsorption seen after administration of loop diuretics and thus potentiate the natriuretic efficacy of loop diuretics even in advanced renal failure. In a single-blind, randomized, placebo controlled crossover study we compared the natriuretic and chloruretic effect of the loop diuretic, torasemide, given alone or in combination with the thiazide diuretic, butizid, in 10 patients with advanced renal failure (mean CIn 13.1 +/- 5.9 ml/min/1.73 m2). For two weeks patients adhered to a diet containing a standardized amount of Na+ and K+. On the 6th and 13th study days, two sham infusions were given to patients in order to assess basal 24-hour urinary electrolyte excretion. On the 7th and 14th days they were randomly allocated to receive either 50 mg i.v. torasemide in combination with a sham infusion or torasemide in combination with 20 mg i.v. butizid. Administration of torasemide alone significantly (P < 0.01) increased mean cumulative 24-hour excretion of sodium (from 154 +/- 30 to 232 +/- 59 mmol/24 hr) and chloride (from 128 +/- 21 to 233 +/- 84 mmol/24 hr) as compared with baseline.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n## Response:\nNONE"}

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\nRESULTS: The median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female. The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died. Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife. Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city. The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%). Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%). The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%). No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease. Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\nCONCLUSIONS: During the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.

Mean adherence, as assessed via electronic monitoring caps, was high and comparable between groups for both ARV (iTAB 86.2 % vs. CTRL 84.8 %; p = 0.95, Cliff's d = 0.01) and PSY (iTAB 78.9 % vs. CTRL 77.3 %; p = 0.43, Cliff's d = -0.13) medications. However, iTAB participants took ARVs significantly closer to their intended dosing time than CTRL participants (iTAB: 27.8 vs. CTRL: 77.0 min from target time; p = 0.02, Cliff's d = 0.37). There was no group difference on PSY dose timing. Text messaging interventions may represent a low-burden approach to improving timeliness of medication-taking behaviors among difficult-to-treat populations. The benefits of improved dose timing for long-term medication adherence require additional investigation.\n## Response:\nFALSE"}

However, opioids could be prescribed at physician discretion by overriding the EHR. This study aims to examine protocol compliance in a large group practice using EHR order sets and complication rates as compared with historical data.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Case series with chart review.\nSETTING: Ambulatory care within a health maintenance organization.\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS: Procedural codes were used to identify children <7 years old who underwent tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy approximately 1.5 years before and after implementation of EHR protocol (n = 437). Primary outcome was opioid pain prescriptions received by patients. Secondary outcomes were emergency or urgent care utilization, postoperative bleeding, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, death, and reasons for prescribing opioid pain medication after EHR protocol implementation. Chi-square analysis and Fischer's exact testing were used to compare differences in event rates.\nRESULTS: Implementation of an age-based narcotic protocol significantly decreased physician narcotic prescribing from 82.2% to 15.4% (P < .0001). The most common reason for narcotic prescription after the intervention was the report of inadequate pain control by phone call (35%). There was no significant difference in rate of emergency or urgent care utilization between pre- and postimplementation groups (4% vs 6%, P = .29).\nCONCLUSIONS: Implementation of an age-based narcotic restriction for posttonsillectomy patients using an EHR order set is an effective and safe way to influence physician prescription practices.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

To be fully active, immune T cells need a co-stimulatory signal in addition to the main antigen-driven signal. Abatacept modulates co-stimulation and prevents full T-cell activation. We evaluated the effect of abatacept in recent-onset type 1 diabetes.\nMETHODS: In this multicentre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial, patients aged 6-45 years recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive abatacept (10 mg/kg, maximum 1000 mg per dose) or placebo infusions intravenously on days 1, 14, 28, and monthly for a total of 27 infusions over 2 years. Computer-generated permuted block randomisation was used, with a block size of 3 and stratified by participating site. Neither patients nor research personnel were aware of treatment assignments. The primary outcome was baseline-adjusted geometric mean 2-h area-under-the-curve (AUC) serum C-peptide concentration after a mixed-meal tolerance test at 2 years' follow-up. Analysis was by intention to treat for all patients for whom data were available. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00505375.\nFINDINGS: 112 patients were assigned to treatment groups (77 abatacept, 35 placebo). Adjusted C-peptide AUC was 59% (95% CI 6\u00b71-112) higher at 2 years with abatacept (n=73, 0\u00b7378 nmol/L) than with placebo (n=30, 0\u00b7238 nmol/L; p=0\u00b70029). The difference between groups was present throughout the trial, with an estimated 9\u00b76 months' delay (95% CI 3\u00b747-15\u00b76) in C-peptide reduction with abatacept. There were few infusion-related adverse events (36 reactions occurred in 17 [22%] patients on abatacept and 11 reactions in six [17%] on placebo). There was no increase in infections (32 [42%] patients on abatacept vs 15 [43%] on placebo) or neutropenia (seven [9%] vs five [14%]).\nINTERPRETATION: Co-stimulation modulation with abatacept slowed reduction in \u03b2-cell function over 2 years. The beneficial effect suggests that T-cell activation still occurs around the time of clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. Yet, despite continued administration of abatacept over 24 months, the decrease in \u03b2-cell function with abatacept was parallel to that with placebo after 6 months of treatment, causing us to speculate that T-cell activation lessens with time. Further observation will establish whether the beneficial effect continues after cessation of abatacept infusions.\nFUNDING: US National Institutes of Health.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

Over the past decade the scientific and medical community has had the opportunity to evaluate the safety record of research studies and clinical applications of TMS and repetitive TMS (rTMS). In these years the number of applications of conventional TMS has grown impressively, new paradigms of stimulation have been developed (e.g., patterned repetitive TMS) and technical advances have led to new device designs and to the real-time integration of TMS with electroencephalography (EEG), positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Thousands of healthy subjects and patients with various neurological and psychiatric diseases have undergone TMS allowing a better assessment of relative risks. The occurrence of seizures (i.e., the most serious TMS-related acute adverse effect) has been extremely rare, with most of the few new cases receiving rTMS exceeding previous guidelines, often in patients under treatment with drugs which potentially lower the seizure threshold. The present updated guidelines review issues of risk and safety of conventional TMS protocols, address the undesired effects and risks of emerging TMS interventions, the applications of TMS in patients with implanted electrodes in the central nervous system, and safety aspects of TMS in neuroimaging environments. We cover recommended limits of stimulation parameters and other important precautions, monitoring of subjects, expertise of the rTMS team, and ethical issues. While all the recommendations here are expert based, they utilize published data to the extent possible.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Eighty children, 2 years to 12 years of age, with acute moderate attacks of asthma, were randomized into two groups. One group received nebulized salbutamol (0.15 mg/kg) and placebo at half-hourly intervals for three doses, and a single dose of oral prednisolone (2 mg/kg) (prednisolone group) and other group received three doses of nebulized salbutamol and budesonide (800 microg) at half-hourly intervals and a single dose of placebo tablets (budesonide group). The baseline characteristics of the two groups were similar, but after three doses of nebulization oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, pulmonary index and respiratory distress score were significantly improved in the budesonide group compared to prednisolone group (p < 0.01). The proportion of patients who were fit for discharge at the end of 2 h after the third dose of nebulization was significantly higher in the budesonide group than in the prednisolone group (22/ 41, 54% vs 7/39, 18%, p < 0.001). The data suggest that a combination of nebulized salbutamol and budesonide should be preferred in the emergency room management of children with acute moderate to severe exacerbation of asthma and who are not on prior oral or inhaled steroid therapy.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

As part of a coordinated treatment effort for the injured patient, preventive antibiotic use can reduce subsequent infectious complications. Available evidence supports the use of antibiotic(s) with activity against both aerobic and anaerobic enteric pathogens for patients with penetrating abdominal injuries and bowel penetration. Patients with open fractures benefit from the use of an antibiotic with activity against Staphylococcus aureus. Data on the ideal dose and duration of antibiotic administration in these situations are incomplete. It is likely that the best results will be obtained with early parenteral administration of large doses of the chosen antibiotic continuing for less than or equal to 24 hours. For injuries other than penetrating abdominal wounds and open fractures, definitive information is not available.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

During the clinical development of Zostavax, which was mainly in the US, the vaccine was administrated by the subcutaneous (SC) route. In Europe, many healthcare professionals prefer administering vaccines by the intramuscular (IM) route. This was an open-label, randomised trial conducted in 354 subjects aged \u226550 years. The primary objectives were to demonstrate that IM administration is both non-inferior to SC administration in terms of 4-week post-vaccination geometric mean titres (GMTs), and elicits an acceptable geometric mean fold-rise (GMFR) of antibody titres measured by glycoprotein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Pre-specified non-inferiority was set as the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the GMT ratio (IM/SC) being >0.67. An acceptable GMFR for the IM route was pre-specified as the lower bound of its 95% CI being >1.4. Description of the VZV immune response using the interferon-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot (IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT) assay and of the safety were secondary objectives. Participants were randomised to IM or SC administration (1:1). The baseline demographics were comparable between groups; mean age: 62.6 years (range: 50.0-90.5). The primary immunogenicity objectives were met (per protocol analysis): GMT ratio (IM/SC): 1.05 (95% CI: 0.93-1.18); GMFR: 2.7 (2.4-3.0). VZV immune response using IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT were comparable between groups. Frequencies of systemic adverse events were comparable between groups. Injection-site reactions were less frequent with IM than SC route: erythema (15.9% versus 52.5%), pain (25.6% versus 39.5%) and swelling (13.6% versus 37.3%), respectively. In adults aged \u226550 years, IM administration of Zostavax elicited similar immune responses to SC administration and was well tolerated, with fewer injection-site reactions than with SC administration.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

The primary end point was progression-free survival.\nRESULTS: A total of 599 patients received cetuximab plus FOLFIRI, and 599 received FOLFIRI alone. The hazard ratio for progression-free survival in the cetuximab-FOLFIRI group as compared with the FOLFIRI group was 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72 to 0.99; P=0.048). There was no significant difference in the overall survival between the two treatment groups (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.07; P=0.31). There was a significant interaction between treatment group and KRAS mutation status for tumor response (P=0.03) but not for progression-free survival (P=0.07) or overall survival (P=0.44). The hazard ratio for progression-free survival among patients with wild-type-KRAS tumors was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.50 to 0.94), in favor of the cetuximab-FOLFIRI group. The following grade 3 or 4 adverse events were more frequent with cetuximab plus FOLFIRI than with FOLFIRI alone: skin reactions (which were grade 3 only) (in 19.7% vs. 0.2% of patients, P<0.001), infusion-related reactions (in 2.5% vs. 0%, P<0.001), and diarrhea (in 15.7% vs. 10.5%, P=0.008).\nCONCLUSIONS: First-line treatment with cetuximab plus FOLFIRI, as compared with FOLFIRI alone, reduced the risk of progression of metastatic colorectal cancer. The benefit of cetuximab was limited to patients with KRAS wild-type tumors. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00154102.)\n## Response:\nFALSE"}

We did a multicentre randomised controlled trial to test the hypothesis that intrapartum monitoring with cardiotocography combined with automatic ST-waveform analysis results in an improved perinatal outcome compared with cardiotocography alone.\nMETHODS: At three Swedish labour wards, 4966 women with term fetuses in the cephalic presentation entered the trial during labour after a clinical decision had been made to apply a fetal scalp electrode for internal cardiotocography. They were randomly assigned monitoring with cardiotocography plus ST analysis (CTG+ST group) or cardiotocography only (CTG group). The main outcome measure was rate of umbilical-artery metabolic acidosis (pH <7.05 and base deficit >12 mmol/L). Secondary outcomes included operative delivery for fetal distress. Results were first analysed according to intention to treat, and secondly after exclusion of cases with severe malformations or with inadequate monitoring.\nFINDINGS: The CTG+ST group showed significantly lower rates of umbilical-artery metabolic acidosis than the cardiotocography group (15 of 2159 [0.7%] vs 31 of 2079 [2%], relative risk 0.47 [95% CI 0.25-0.86], p=0.02) and of operative delivery for fetal distress (193 of 2519 [8%] vs 227 of 2447 [9%], 0.83 [0.69-0.99], p=0.047) when all cases were included according to intention to treat.

We sought to determine if and where on this continuum of care racial/ethnic disparities were evident. Data from the Flexible Initial Retrovirus Suppressive Therapies (FIRST) trial, which evaluated three strategies for initial HIV therapy, were compared for White, African American, and Latino subjects. Outcomes included progression of disease and death, HIV viral suppression, and change in CD4(+) cell count. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for known predictors of survival. There were 1357 subjects, including 368 non-Latino white, 751 non-Latino African American, and 238 Latino subjects. At baseline, the two latter groups were more likely to have had AIDS and had lower CD4(+) cell counts than white subjects. In follow-up, African American subjects had lower self-reported adherence to therapy, lower CD4(+) cell count increases, and lower odds of viral suppression. African American and Latino subjects had unadjusted hazard ratios of progression of disease or death of 1.57 (1.17, 2.10; p = 0.0025) and 1.57 (1.09, 2.26; p = 0.02), respectively. Adjusting for baseline differences and differences in adherence, CD4(+) cell count change, and viral suppression accounted for the disparities in outcomes. Opportunities to reduce disparities in outcomes for African American and Latino patients exist along the continuum of HIV care. Efforts to promote access to HIV testing and care and to improve adherence have the potential to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in outcomes of patients with HIV infection.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Gaseous nitric oxide has been demonstrated to have a myocardial protective effect following ischemia-reperfusion. We hypothesized that gaseous nitric oxide administered during cardiopulmonary bypass would have similar beneficial effects.\nMETHODS: In a prospective, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study, children undergoing repair of tetralogy of Fallot received either 20 ppm of gaseous nitric oxide or placebo delivered to the membrane oxygenator during cardiopulmonary bypass.\nRESULTS: A total of 16 children were randomized into 2 equal groups once their parents or guardians had given written informed consent. No differences were found in age, crossclamp time, cardiopulmonary bypass time, or methemoglobin between the 2 groups. The group receiving gaseous nitric oxide had a significantly shortened duration of mechanical ventilation (8.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.6 vs 16.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.5 hours; P\u00a0<\u00a0.05) and intensive care unit length of stay (53.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a019.7 vs 79.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a037.7 hours; P\u00a0<\u00a0.05) compared with the placebo group. The patients had significantly lower troponin levels at 12, 24, and 48 hours (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05) and lower B-type natriuretic peptide levels at 12 and 24 hours (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). A trend was found toward a less positive fluid balance, with significantly less diuretic usage. The study patients had a greater mean hemoglobin at 48 hours, despite the absence of differences in chest tube output, packed red blood cell transfusion, platelet counts or transfusion requirements, fresh frozen plasma transfusion, or prothrombin time/partial thromboplastin time in the first 48 hours.\nCONCLUSIONS: The delivery of gaseous nitric oxide to the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit for children undergoing cardiac surgery results in myocardial protection, improved fluid balance, and an improved postoperative intensive care unit course.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Autologous blood retransfusion is not devoid of risk. We hypothesized that adding tranexamic acid (TXA) to a restrictive blood transfusion protocol would reduce the need for postoperative autologous blood retransfusion in primary knee and hip arthroplasty.\nSTUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Ninety-eight adult patients undergoing primary THA or TKA were randomly assigned to receive an intraoperative intravenous loading dose of 1.0\u2009g of TXA followed by another 1.0-g dose 3 hours later (TXA group) or a matching volume 0.9% saline placebo (control group). A postoperatively shed autologous blood recovery system was used in all patients and the minimum reinfusion volume set at 250\u2009mL. Red blood cells were transfused if hemoglobin level was less than 8 or if 8 to 10\u2009g/dL with symptoms of anemia.\nRESULTS: The proportion of patients receiving autologous blood reinfusion was significantly lower in the TXA group (5/49) compared to placebo (42/49) with an absolute difference of -75.5% (adjusted relative risk, 0.005), and none of the patients in the TXA group received more than 400\u2009mL retransfused. Median total external blood loss during the first 24 hours was lower in the TXA group, 320\u2009mL (range, 80-930\u2009mL), compared to 970\u2009mL (range, 100-2600\u2009mL) in the placebo group (p\u2009<\u20090.001). There were no significant differences in homologous blood transfusions and hematologic variables between groups. Treatment differences were consistent by size and significance when the analysis was repeated separately in patients undergoing TKA or THA.\nCONCLUSION: Addition of TXA to a restrictive transfusion protocol makes the use of a postoperative blood salvage system in patients undergoing primary hip and knee arthroplasty unnecessary.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

A different sample of 8 pediatric OCD patients and 8 healthy children had a 1H-MRS examination of occipital cortex.\nRESULTS: Caudate glutamatergic concentrations (Glx) were significantly greater in treatment-naive OCD patients than in controls but declined significantly after paroxetine treatment to levels comparable with those of controls. Decrease in caudate Glx was associated with decrease in OCD symptom severity. Occipital Glx did not differ between OCD patients and controls.\nCONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings provide new evidence of Glx abnormalities in the caudate nucleus in pediatric OCD and suggest that paroxetine treatment may be mediated by a serotonergically modulated reduction in caudate Glx.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

An injection of autologous blood might provide the necessary cellular and humoral mediators to induce a healing cascade. The purpose of this study was to evaluate prospectively the results of refractory lateral epicondylitis treated with autologous blood injections.\nMETHOD: Twenty-eight patients with lateral epicondylitis were injected with 2 mL of autologous blood under the extensor carpi radialis brevis. All patients had failed previous nonsurgical treatments including all or combinations of physical therapy, splinting, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication, and prior steroid injections. Patients kept personal logs and rated their pain (0-10) and categorized themselves according to Nirschl staging (0-7) daily.\nRESULTS: The average follow-up period was 9.5 months (range, 6-24 mo). After autologous blood injections the average pain score decreased from 7.8 to 2.3. The average Nirschl stage decreased from 6.5 to 2.0. For the 9 patients receiving more than one blood injection the mean pain score and Nirschl stage before injection were 7.2 and 6.6, respectively. After the second blood injection the pain and Nirschl scores were both 0.9. Two patients received a third blood injection that brought both pain and Nirschl scores to 0.\nCONCLUSIONS: After autologous blood injection therapy 22 patients (79%) in whom nonsurgical modalities had failed were relieved completely of pain even during strenuous activity. This study offers encouraging results of an alternative minimally invasive treatment that addresses the pathophysiology of lateral epicondylitis that has failed traditional nonsurgical modalities.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

In this paper, we present results from an analysis of existing data about the demographic and clinical characteristics, service needs and utilization patterns, and primary care retention of HIV-positive primary care patients seen at FCHC during a 24-month study period. Patient data were extracted from Logician, FCHC's electronic medical record system, and imported into Microsoft Access, Microsoft Excel and SAS for manipulation and analysis. A total of 999 unique individuals were included in the study population. Most were men (97%), white (75%) and between 39 and 80 years of age. Patients averaged 6.7 medical visits annually at FCHC, and 61% had at least one medical visit every six months. Significant predictors of primary care utilization were insurance status, HIV disease stage, being on combination therapy, first CD4 count, first viral load level and receipt of ancillary services. Need and receipt of ancillary services were found through medical and case management record review; case management was the most used ancillary service, received by 36% of the study population. For most ancillary services, clients with assessed need had documented receipt of the service. Publicly insured and/or Ryan White CARE Act-funded patients had the greatest ancillary service utilization. The influence of ancillary services upon primary care entry could not be evaluated with available data; however, their influence upon primary care was significant. For patients who received primary care in every continuous six-month period, statistically significant associations were found with receipt of mental health care, case management, drug assistance, food/nutrition, complementary services and housing. Using the more rigorous FCHC standard of care (minimum of four primary care visits per year), significant associations were also found with transportation, legal services and substance abuse treatment. For non-whites and women, mental health care, food/nutrition, housing and transportation had particular significance.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Lesion and stimulation studies suggest involvement of the amygdala in the generation of the skin conductance response (SCR), which is an indirect measure of autonomic activity that has been associated with both emotion and attention. It is unclear if this involvement marks an emotional reaction to an external stimulus or sympathetic arousal regardless of its origin. We recorded skin conductance in parallel with single-unit activity from the right amygdala of two rhesus monkeys during a rewarded image viewing task and while the monkeys sat alone in a dimly lit room, drifting in and out of sleep. In both experimental conditions, we found similar SCR-related modulation of activity at the single-unit and neural population level. This suggests that the amygdala contributes to the production or modulation of SCRs regardless of the source of sympathetic arousal.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Nevertheless, significant safety and efficacy deficits continue to exist. Severe idiosyncratic reactions and organ toxicity have hampered the wide use of some of the newer AEDs. As a decade before, about one third of patients with chronic epilepsy is resistant to current pharmacotherapy. Even in patients in whom pharmacotherapy is efficacious, current AED do not seem to affect the progression or the underlying natural history of epilepsy. In addition, there is currently no drug available which prevents the development of epilepsy, e.g. after head trauma. Thus, there is an unmet need for safer and more effective drugs, especially for chronic, drug-resistant epilepsy. To stimulate the development of even better compounds, the demonstrated benefits and risks of current new AEDs are reviewed.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

In multiple logistic regression analyses that adjusted for potential confounders, contact with a case manager at baseline was associated with decreased unmet need for income assistance (odds ratio [OR], 0.57 [95% CI, 0.36 to 0.91]), health insurance (OR, 0.54 [CI, 0.33 to 0.89]), home health care (OR, 0.29 [CI, 0.15 to 0.56]), and emotional counseling (OR, 0.62 [CI, 0.41 to 0.94]) at follow-up.

The aims of the study were to investigate whether beta-adrenoceptor stimulation and hypoxia exerted additive or potentiating effects on the FECG and several cardiovascular parameters and whether the hypoxic changes of the FECG could be blocked by beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents. The FECG changes were studied in order to correlate them with cardiovascular function, as measured by heart rate, mean arterial pressure, end diastolic pressure, maximum dP/dt and combined cardiac output, estimated by the thermodilution method, as well as with blood gases, acid base status, blood lactate and glucose. Injections of small doses (0.02 to 0.4 microg kg-1 min-1) of isoprenaline induced the same pattern of changes in the FECG as we have previously recorded during hypoxia. By increasing the isoprenaline dose an increase in the duration of the FECG changes and amplitude of the T-wave changes was obtained. Propranolol was found to completely abolish the FECG changes induced by isoprenaline, as well as by mild hypoxia. During severe hypoxia the FECG changes could not be abolished by propranolol. Our previous findings indicated that the hypoxic changes could be regarded as a sign of myocardial glycolysis. Thus, the present finding that even small doses of isoprenaline given to the fetus, initiates the same pattern of FECG changes corroborate this hypothesis.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Several studies have shown that regular physical exercise is significantly beneficial for psychiatric patients both on a biological and a psychological level. Positive effects of controlled exercise include improved metabolic responses, neuro-protection, increased quality of life, and reduced psychopathological symptoms. Studies investigating the effectiveness of various physical training interventions in alleviating severe mental diseases, such as Alzheimer's dementia (AD), schizophrenia (SZ) or major depressive disorder (MDD) indicate that physical exercise can relieve symptoms of depression, psychosis and dementia and more importantly can curtail further progression of these diseases. This review assesses the most effective methods of physical training for specific psychiatric symptoms. Introducing physical exercise in therapeutic regimes would be an innovative approach that could significantly reduce the severity of psychopathological and cognitive symptoms in patients. The positive biological and molecular outcomes associated with physical exercise render it a concrete therapeutic strategy for improving the quality of live and reducing physical illness in psychiatric patients. Therefore, integrating physical activity into a patient's social life may be an effective treatment strategy. Furthermore, exercise might have the potential to be a preventative treatment within the context of multi-modal therapeutic programs.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

(ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00395083) SETTING: 20 Veterans Affairs hospital-based outpatient clinics.\nPARTICIPANTS: Patients hospitalized for COPD in the past year.\nINTERVENTION: The CCMP included COPD education during 4 individual sessions and 1 group session, an action plan for identification and treatment of exacerbations, and scheduled proactive telephone calls for case management. Patients in both the intervention and usual care groups received a COPD informational booklet; their primary care providers received a copy of COPD guidelines and were advised to manage their patients according to these guidelines. Patients were randomly assigned, stratifying by site based on random, permuted blocks of variable size.\nMEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was time to first COPD hospitalization. Staff blinded to study group performed telephone-based assessment of COPD exacerbations and hospitalizations, and all hospitalizations were blindly adjudicated. Secondary outcomes included non-COPD health care use, all-cause mortality, health-related quality of life, patient satisfaction, disease knowledge, and self-efficacy.\nRESULTS: Of the eligible patients, 209 were randomly assigned to the intervention group and 217 to the usual care group. Citing serious safety concerns, the data monitoring committee terminated the intervention before the trial's planned completion after 426 (44%) of the planned total of 960 patients were enrolled. Mean follow-up was 250 days. When the study was stopped, the 1-year cumulative incidence of COPD-related hospitalization was 27% in the intervention group and 24% in the usual care group (hazard ratio, 1.13 [95% CI, 0.70 to 1.80]; P= 0.62). There were 28 deaths from all causes in the intervention group versus 10 in the usual care group (hazard ratio, 3.00 [CI, 1.46 to 6.17]; P= 0.003). Cause could be assigned in 27 (71%) deaths. Deaths due to COPD accounted for the largest difference: 10 in the intervention group versus 3 in the usual care group (hazard ratio, 3.60 [CI, 0.99 to 13.08]; P= 0.053).\nLIMITATIONS: Available data could not fully explain the excess mortality in the intervention group. Ability to assess the quality of the educational sessions provided by the case managers was limited.\nCONCLUSION: A CCMP in patients with severe COPD had not decreased COPD-related hospitalizations when the trial was stopped prematurely. The CCMP was associated with unanticipated excess mortality, results that differ markedly from similar previous trials. A data monitoring committee should be considered in the design of clinical trials involving behavioral interventions.\n## Response:\nFALSE"}

Week 12\nAbstract: Dietary restriction (DR) delays or prevents age-related diseases and extends lifespan in species ranging from yeast to primates. Although the applicability of this regimen to humans remains uncertain, a proportional response would add more healthy years to the average life than even a cure for cancer or heart disease. Because it is unlikely that many would be willing or able to maintain a DR lifestyle, there has been intense interest in mimicking its beneficial effects on health, and potentially longevity, with drugs. To date, such efforts have been hindered primarily by our lack of mechanistic understanding of how DR works. Sirtuins, NAD(+)-dependent deacetylases and ADP-ribosyltransferases that influence lifespan in lower organisms, have been proposed to be key mediators of DR, and based on this model, the sirtuin activator resveratrol has been proposed as a candidate DR mimetic. Indeed, resveratrol extends lifespan in yeast, worms, flies, and a short-lived species of fish. In rodents, resveratrol improves health, and prevents the early mortality associated with obesity, but its precise mechanism of action remains a subject of debate, and extension of normal lifespan has not been observed. This review summarizes recent work on resveratrol, sirtuins, and their potential to mimic beneficial effects of DR.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

This was followed by an additional 8 weeks of open-label treatment for modafinil responders and 12 weeks for placebo nonresponders. The primary outcome measure for fatigue and depression was the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale, supplemented by the FSS, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and Beck Depression Inventory. Safety was assessed with assays of CD4 cell count and HIV ribonucleic acid (RNA) viral load. Visits were weekly for 4 weeks, then biweekly, with a follow-up visit at 6 months. Maximum trial dose of modafinil was 200 mg/d. Data for this study were collected between December 2004 and December 2008.\nRESULTS: 115 patients were randomly assigned. In intention-to-treat analyses, fatigue response rate to modafinil was 73% and to placebo, 28%. Attrition was 9%. Modafinil did not have an effect on mood alone in the absence of improved energy. At week 4, CD4 cell counts did not change significantly; HIV RNA viral load showed a trend decline for patients taking modafinil but not for those taking placebo. At 6 months, those still taking modafinil had more energy and fewer depressive symptoms than patients who were not taking modafinil, and only those still taking modafinil showed a significant decline from baseline in their HIV RNA viral load.\nCONCLUSIONS: Modafinil appears to be effective and well tolerated in treating fatigue in HIV+ patients. Consideration of its use is warranted considering the high prevalence of fatigue in the HIV community, its minimal side effects, and overall patient acceptance.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00118378.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

Week 12\nAbstract: Red wine contains many compounds that may have therapeutic use, including resveratrol (3,4',5-trihydroxytrans-stilbene). Since resveratrol could be administered both in the diet and as a therapeutic agent, defining appropriate concentrations requires understanding of the pharmacokinetics. Resveratrol absorption is rapid but plasma concentrations are low as it is rapidly and efficiently converted into relatively hydrophilic phase-2 conjugates, and metabolites, which are then rapidly excreted via the urine and bile. Resveratrol is an effective antioxidant in vivo by increasing NO synthesis and also maintaining the reduced intracellular redox state via the thioredoxin system. Further, activation of sirtuins (one class of lysine deacetylases) may mediate the cardiovascular responses shown by resveratrol. Studies on animal models of human disease suggest that resveratrol has the potential to decrease cardiovascular symptoms in patients with myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, hypertension, cardiomyopathies, fibrosis, atherosclerosis, thrombosis and diabetes, but, as yet, human clinical trials are rare. Cardioprotection by resveratrol in rodent models may rely on mechanisms producing pharmacological preconditioning in the heart including reducing reactive oxygen species, improving vasorelaxation and angiogenesis, preventing inflammation and apoptosis, delaying atherosclerosis as well as decreasing cardiovascular remodelling. Interventional studies in humans need to be completed before resveratrol can be considered as a standard therapeutic agent. Therefore, future studies should focus on obtaining the level of evidence required to determine whether resveratrol can be added to the list of evidence-based therapies for cardiovascular diseases that includes renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and calcium entry blockers.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

The primary outcomes were scores on the modified Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ) (on a scale of 0 to 23, with higher scores indicating greater disability) and patients' ratings of average pain intensity during the preceding 24 hours at 1 month (on a scale of 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more severe pain). Patients were allowed to cross over to the other study group after 1 month.\nRESULTS: All patients underwent the assigned intervention (68 vertebroplasties and 63 simulated procedures). The baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. At 1 month, there was no significant difference between the vertebroplasty group and the control group in either the RDQ score (difference, 0.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], -1.3 to 2.8; P=0.49) or the pain rating (difference, 0.7; 95% CI, -0.3 to 1.7; P=0.19). Both groups had immediate improvement in disability and pain scores after the intervention. Although the two groups did not differ significantly on any secondary outcome measure at 1 month, there was a trend toward a higher rate of clinically meaningful improvement in pain (a 30% decrease from baseline) in the vertebroplasty group (64% vs. 48%, P=0.06). At 3 months, there was a higher crossover rate in the control group than in the vertebroplasty group (51% vs. 13%, P<0.001) [corrected]. There was one serious adverse event in each group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Improvements in pain and pain-related disability associated with osteoporotic compression fractures in patients treated with vertebroplasty were similar to the improvements in a control group.

We compared the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin with glipizide in patients with T2DM and moderate-to-severe chronic renal insufficiency and inadequate glycemic control.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients (n = 426) were randomized 1:1 to sitagliptin (50 mg every day [q.d.] for moderate renal insufficiency and 25 mg q.d. for severe renal insufficiency) or glipizide (2.5 mg q.d., adjusted based on glycemic control to a 10-mg twice a day maximum dose). Randomization was stratified by: 1) renal status (moderate or severe renal insufficiency); 2) history of cardiovascular disease; and 3) history of heart failure.\nRESULTS: At week 54, treatment with sitagliptin was noninferior to treatment with glipizide in A1C change from baseline (-0.8 vs. -0.6%; between-group difference -0.11%; 95% CI -0.29 to 0.06) because the upper bound of the 95% CI was less than the prespecified noninferiority margin of 0.4%. There was a lower incidence of symptomatic hypoglycemia adverse events (AEs) with sitagliptin versus glipizide (6.2 and 17.0%, respectively; P = 0.001) and a decrease in body weight with sitagliptin (-0.6 kg) versus an increase (1.2 kg) with glipizide (difference, -1.8 kg; P < 0.001). The incidence of gastrointestinal AEs was low with both treatments.\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with T2DM and chronic renal insufficiency, sitagliptin and glipizide provided similar A1C-lowering efficacy. Sitagliptin was generally well-tolerated, with a lower risk of hypoglycemia and weight loss versus weight gain, relative to glipizide.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

The remainder of the patients received supplemental oxygen through a face mask with no lavender oil. Outcome variables included pain scores (a numeric rating scale from 0 to 10) at 5, 30, and 60 minutes postoperatively, narcotic requirements in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), patient satisfaction with pain control, as well as time to discharge from the PACU. There were no significant differences in narcotic requirements and recovery room discharge times between the two groups. Postoperative lavender oil aromatherapy did not significantly affect pain scores. However, patients in the lavender group reported a higher satisfaction rate with pain control than patients in the control group (P = 0.0001).\n## Response:\nNONE"}

This paper reviews the evidence for mental health and mental health care disparities, comparing them to patterns in health. Strategies for addressing disparities in health care, such as improving access to and quality of care, should also work to eliminate mental health care disparities. In addition, a diverse mental health workforce, as well as provider and patient education, are important to eliminating mental health care disparities.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

This study investigated whether cigarette demand predicted response to contingent monetary rewards for abstinence among individuals with substance use disorders. It also sought to replicate evidence for greater price sensitivity at whole-dollar pack price transitions (ie, left-digit effects).\nMETHODS: Participants (N = 338) were individuals in residential substance use disorder treatment who participated in a randomized controlled trial that compared contingent vouchers to noncontingent vouchers for smoking abstinence. Baseline demand indices were used to predict number of abstinent days during the 14-day voucher period (after the reduction lead-in) and at 1 and 3 months afterward.\nRESULTS: Demand indices correlated with measures of smoking and nicotine dependence. As measured by elasticity, intensity and O max, higher demand significantly predicted fewer abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings during voucher period for individuals in the noncontingent vouchers condition. Breakpoint exhibited a trend-level association with abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings. Demand indices did not predict abstinence in the contingent vouchers group, and did not predict abstinence at 1- and 3-month follow-ups. Left-digit price transitions were associated with significantly greater reductions in consumption.\nCONCLUSIONS: The association of cigarette demand with smoking behavior only in the group for whom abstinence was not incentivized indicates that CPT assesses the value of smoking more than the value of money per se and that vouchers counteract the effects of the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes. Results provide initial short-term evidence of predictive validity for the CPT indices.\nIMPLICATIONS: This study provides the first evidence of the validity of the CPT for predicting early response to brief advice for smoking cessation plus nicotine replacement in smokers with substance dependence. However, demand for cigarettes did not predict voucher-based treatment response, indicating that incentives serve as a powerful motivator not to smoke that acts in opposition to the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes and that the indices reflect the value of smoking more than the value of money per se.\n## Response:\nFALSE"}

The Critical Appraisal Skills Program tool and the recommendations of Squires for evaluating translation methods in qualitative research were applied to appraise study quality. Authors coded through directed content analysis and an adaptation of the Joanna Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument coding template to extract themes. Coding focused on food patterns, obesity, population breakdown, immigration, acculturation, and barriers and facilitators to healthy eating. Other themes and categories emerged from this process to complement this approach.\nRESULTS: Major findings included the following: (a) Immigration driven changes in scheduling, food choice, socioeconomic status, and family dynamics shape the complex psychology behind healthy food choices for Latina women; (b) in Latina populations, barriers and facilitators to healthy lifestyle choices around food are complex; and (c) there is a clear need to differentiate Latino populations by country of origin in future qualitative studies on eating behavior.\nDISCUSSION: Healthcare providers need to recognize the complex influences behind eating behaviors among immigrant Latinas in order to design effective behavior change and goal-setting programs to support healthy lifestyles.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Women who had a stable relationship (n = 170) also answered a questionnaire regarding psychosocial situation, partner relationship and sexual life, and were asked to give a similar questionnaire to their partner. Totally, 109 partners participated.\nRESULTS: The vast majority of the women considered that their urinary problems affected their physical activities negatively and almost half reported negative consequences for social life and joint activities. One third of both women and men experienced a negative impact on their relationship and about every fifth felt it had a harmful influence on physical proximity, intimacy, affection, and warmth. Compared to the older women, the younger were less satisfied with their psychological health, sexual life, leisure and financial situation, and compared to the younger men, the young women were less content with their somatic health. Overall, women with urinary problems and their partners were less satisfied with their somatic health than the corresponding age groups in the national population-based study.\nCONCLUSIONS: Female urinary incontinence, urgency and frequency significantly impair the quality of life in both younger and older women, and also have negative effects on the partner relationship and the partner's life.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

We assessed predictors of receiving influenza vaccination, and examined the relationship between influenza vaccination and outcomes in a propensity-adjusted model.\nRESULTS: Of 8,099 study participants, 1,769 (21%) received influenza vaccination. We observed significant regional variation in vaccination rates, with highest rates in the Netherlands (77.5%), Great Britain (77.2%), and Belgium (67.5%), and lowest rates in Asia (2.6%), with intermediate rates in North America (52.8%). Top predictors of vaccination included enrolling country, white race, implanted defibrillator, older age, lower New York Heart Association functional class, lower heart rate, and a history of diabetes mellitus. Influenza vaccination was associated with a reduced risk for all-cause mortality in propensity-adjusted (hazard ratio: 0.81; 95% confidence interval: 0.67 to 0.97; p\u00a0= 0.015) models.\nCONCLUSIONS: Influenza vaccination rates varied widely in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction enrolled in the PARADIGM-HF trial, and vaccination was associated with reduced risk for death, although whether this association was causal cannot be determined.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

This study evaluated the efficacy of Many Men, Many Voices (3MV), a small-group HIV/STI prevention intervention developed by Black MSM-serving community-based organizations and a university-based HIV/STI prevention and training program. The study sample included 338 Black MSM of HIV-negative or unknown HIV serostatus residing in New York city. Participants were randomly assigned to the 3MV intervention condition (n = 164) or wait-list comparison condition (n = 174). Relative to comparison participants, 3MV participants reported significantly greater reductions in any unprotected anal intercourse with casual male partners; a trend for consistent condom use during receptive anal intercourse with casual male partners; and significantly greater reductions in the number of male sex partners and greater increases in HIV testing.

We assessed the impact of immediate vs as-needed oral etoposide (ET) among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals with mild-to-moderate KS initiating ART.\nMETHODS: Chemotherapy-naive, HIV type 1-infected adults with mild-to-moderate KS initiating ART in Africa and South America were randomized to ART (tenofovir/emtricitabine/efavirenz) alone (chemotherapy \"as-needed\" arm) vs ART plus up to 8 cycles of oral ET (immediate arm). Participants with KS progression on ART alone received ET as part of the as-needed strategy. Primary outcome was ordinal as follows: failure, stable, and response at 48 weeks. Secondary outcomes included time to initial KS progression, KS-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (KS-IRIS), and KS response.\nRESULTS: Of 190 randomized participants (as-needed = 94, immediate = 96), the majority were men (71%) and African (93%). Failure (53.8% vs 56.6%), stable (16.3% vs 10.8%), and response (30% vs 32.5%) did not differ between arms (as-needed vs immediate) among those with week 48 data potential (N = 163, P = .91). Time to KS progression (P = .021), KS-IRIS (P = .003), and KS response (P = .003) favored the immediate arm. Twenty-five participants died (13%). Mortality, adverse events, CD4+ T-cell changes, and HIV RNA suppression were similar at 48 weeks.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among HIV-infected adults with mild-to-moderate KS, immediate ET provided early, nondurable clinical benefits. By 48 weeks, no clinical benefit was observed compared to use of ET as needed. Mortality was high and tumor response was low.\nCLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT01352117.\n## Response:\nFALSE"}

Patient navigation (PN) may address many underlying barriers to CRCS, yet little is known about the effectiveness of PN to increase CRCS adherence among Latino Medicare enrollees.\nMETHODS: Using a randomized controlled trial study design, we evaluated tailored PN delivered outside of primary care settings as an intervention to increase CRCS adherence in this population. Intervention participants (n = 135) received tailored PN services which included education, counseling, and logistical support administered in their language of choice. Comparison participants (n = 168) received mailed cancer education materials. We compared CRCS rates between interventions and used multivariable logistic regression to assess the odds of CRCS adherence for PN versus comparison groups after adjusting for covariates of interest.\nRESULTS: More navigated than non-navigated participants became CRCS adherent during the study period (43.7 vs. 32.1%, p = 0.04). The odds of CRCS adherence were significantly higher for PN relative to comparison participants before and after adjusting for covariates (unadjusted OR 1.64, p = 0.04; adjusted OR 1.82, p = 0.02). Higher CRCS adherence rates were observed primarily in the uptake of endoscopic screening methods.\nCONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that PN delivered outside of the primary care environment is modestly effective in increasing CRCS adherence among Latino Medicare enrollees. This intervention strategy should be further evaluated as a complement to primary care-based PN and other care coordination strategies to increase adherence with CRCS and other evidence-based screenings among older Latinos.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Cysteamine and its related drugs are currently being evaluated for the treatment of Huntington's and Parkinson's disease. The aim of te study was to understand the pharmacokinetics of cysteamine bitartrate following gastrointestinal infusion.\nMETHOD: Cysteamine bitartrate was delivered through a naso-enteric catheter into the stomach (n = 8), small intestine (n = 8) and caecum (n = 4) of normal subjects. Plasma cysteamine concentrations were determined using LC-MS/MS.\nRESULTS: The rate and extent of drug absorption were assessed by comparing AUC(0, infinity), C(max) and t(max), among the gastrointestinal infusion sites. Total cysteamine exposure, expressed as area under the curve (AUC(0, infinity)) was greatest when the drug was infused into the small intestine (4331.3 +/- 1907.6 min x microM) followed by stomach (3901.9 +/- 1591.9 min x microM) and caecum (3141.4 +/- 1627.6 min x microM). Cysteamine infusion into the small intestine resulted in the most rapid rise to maximal plasma concentrations (t(max) = 21 +/- 0.56 min); t(max) was delayed to 50 +/- 26 min and 64 +/- 26 min after gastric and caecal infusion, respectively. The maximum cysteamine plasma concentration (C(max)) was reached after infusion of the drug into the small intestine (51 +/- 21 microM), which was higher than plasma C(max) concentrations after gastric (39 +/- 16 microM) and caecal infusion (23 +/- 15 microM).\nCONCLUSIONS: The pharmacokinetic data generated help extend our understanding of cysteamine.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Fifty-four percent of the CF sample were achieving the CF dietary recommendations of 120% of the RDA. Despite this energy intake, the CF sample was significantly below the control sample on weight (24.56 vs 31.23 kg), height (125.48 vs 133.06 cm), and z score for weight (-0.811 vs 0.528) and height (-0.797 vs 0.371). On measures of behavioral eating style, the CF sample had significantly longer meals (23.90 min) than the control sample (17.34 min) and had a significantly slower pace of eating (43.27% 10-second intervals with bites) than the control sample (51.29% 10-second intervals with bites) but did not differ significantly on the number of calories consumed during dinner. On a measure of parent report of mealtime behaviors, parents of the children with CF rated mealtime behavior problems of \"dawdles\" and \"refuses food\" as more intense (mean, 3. 46) than did the parents of control children (mean, 2.67). For the CF sample, a significant correlation was found between the parent intensity ratings of problem behavior in general and meal duration (r = .48), and a significant negative correlation was found between the parent intensity ratings of problem mealtime behaviors and the percentage of intervals with bites (pace of meal) (r = -.533).\nCONCLUSIONS: Although the school-age children with CF were consuming more calories per day than their healthy peers, and more than 50% of the children in the CF sample were at or above the CF dietary recommendations, the children in the CF sample were significantly below the control children on measures of weight and height. The behavioral data suggest that increased caloric intake is not without cost, because the CF sample spent an additional 7 minutes per day at dinner and ate their meals at a slower pace than their healthy peers. These data were associated with higher intensity ratings of mealtime behaviors by parents of children with CF. These findings point to the need for individualized assessment of energy needs for school-age children with CF and comprehensive programs that teach parents behavioral strategies to motivate their children to meet these higher energy requirements in an adaptive manner.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

In Phase 2, 67 patients with improvement in hearing underwent a monitored 18-week prednisone taper, resulting in 22 weeks of prednisone therapy at an average dose of 30 mg per day. Thirty-three patients were randomized to receive methotrexate in Phase 2. Thirty-four patients received prednisone and placebo.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Adverse events (AE) in patients treated with prednisone only.\nRESULTS: Of 116 patients, 7 had to stop prednisone therapy during the 1-month challenge phase due to AE. Of 34 patients, 5 were unable to complete the full 22-week course of prednisone due to AE. The most common AE was hyperglycemia, which occurred in 17.6% of patients participating in Phase 2.

Eradication with rescue regimens may be challenging after failure of key antibiotics such as clarithromycin and nitroimidazoles.\nAIM: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a second-line levofloxacin-containing triple regimen (PPI-amoxicillin-levofloxacin) in the eradication of H. pylori after non-bismuth quadruple-containing treatment failure.\nDESIGN: prospective multicenter study.\nPATIENTS: in whom a non-bismuth quadruple regimen, administered either sequentially (PPI + amoxicillin for 5 days followed by PPI + clarithromycin + metronidazole for 5 more days) or concomitantly (PPI + amoxicillin + clarithromycin + metronidazole for 10 days) had previously failed.\nINTERVENTION: levofloxacin (500 mg b.i.d.), amoxicillin (1 g b.i.d.) and PPI (standard dose b.i.d.) for 10 days.\nOUTCOME: eradication was confirmed with (13)C-urea breath test 4-8 weeks after therapy. Compliance and tolerance: compliance was determined through questioning and recovery of empty medication envelopes. Incidence of adverse effects was evaluated by means of a questionnaire.\nRESULTS: 100 consecutive patients were included (mean age 50 years, 62% females, 12% peptic ulcer and 88% dyspepsia): 37 after \"sequential\", and 63 after \"concomitant\" treatment failure. All patients took all medications correctly. Overall, per-protocol and intention-to-treat H. pylori eradication rates were 75.5% (95% CI 66-85%) and 74% (65-83%). Respective intention-to-treat cure rates for \"sequential\" and \"concomitant\" failure regimens were 74.4% and 71.4%, respectively. Adverse effects were reported in six (6%) patients; all of them were mild.\nCONCLUSION: Ten-day levofloxacin-containing triple therapy constitutes an encouraging second-line strategy in patients with previous non-bismuth quadruple \"sequential\" or \"concomitant\" treatment failure.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

We evaluated the effect of oro-mucosal sativex, (THC: CBD), an endocannabinoid system modulator, on pain and allodynia, in 125 patients with neuropathic pain of peripheral origin in a five-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design trial. Patients remained on their existing stable analgesia. A self-titrating regimen was used to optimise drug administration. Sixty-three patients were randomised to receive sativex and 62 placebo. The mean reduction in pain intensity scores (primary outcome measure) was greater in patients receiving sativex than placebo (mean adjusted scores -1.48 points vs. -0.52 points on a 0-10 Numerical Rating Scale (p=0.004; 95% CI: -1.59, -0.32). Improvements in Neuropathic Pain Scale composite score (p=0.007), sleep NRS (p=0.001), dynamic allodynia (p=0.042), punctate allodynia (p=0.021), Pain Disability Index (p=0.003) and Patient's Global Impression of Change (p<0.001) were similarly greater on sativex vs. placebo. Sedative and gastrointestinal side effects were reported more commonly by patients on active medication. Of all participants, 18% on sativex and 3% on placebo withdrew during the study.

However, recent data indicate growing numbers of people who inject drugs (PWIDs) in north and central Indian cities.\nMETHODS: We conducted face-to-face surveys among PWIDs in seven northeast and eight north/central Indian cities using respondent-driven sampling. We used a rapid HIV-testing protocol to identify seropositive individuals and multiassay algorithm to identify those with recent infection. We used multilevel regression models that incorporated sampling weights and had random intercepts for site to assess risk factors for prevalent and incident (recent) HIV infection.\nRESULTS: We surveyed 14\u200a481 PWIDs from 15 Indian cities between January and December 2013. Participants reported high rates of needle/syringe sharing. The median (site range) estimated HIV prevalence and incidence were 18.1% (5.9, 44.9) and 2.9 per 100 person-years (0, 12.4), respectively. HIV prevalence was higher in northeast sites, whereas HIV incidence was higher in north/central sites. The odds of prevalent HIV were over three-fold higher in women than in men. Other factors associated with HIV prevalence or incidence included duration since first injection, injection of pharmaceutical drugs, and needle/syringe sharing.\nCONCLUSIONS: The burden of HIV infection is high among PWIDs in India, and may be increasing in cities where injecting drug use is emerging. Women who inject drugs were at substantially higher risk for HIV than men - a situation that may be mediated by dual injection-related and sexual risks.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Although surgery is usually curative, some individuals fail or are unable or unwilling to undergo parathyroidectomy. In such individuals, targeted medical therapy may be of value. Cinacalcet normalized calcium level and lowered PTH in patients with PHPT in several phase 2 and open-label studies. We compared cinacalcet and placebo in subjects with PHPT unable to undergo parathyroidectomy.\nDESIGN: Phase 3, double-blind, multi centere, randomized, placebo-controlled study.\nMETHODS: Sixty-seven subjects (78% women) with moderate PHPT were randomized (1:1) to cinacalcet or placebo for \u226428 weeks.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Achievement of a normal mean corrected total serum calcium concentration of \u226410.3\u200amg/dl (2.575\u200ammol/l).\nRESULTS: Baseline median (quartile 1 (Q1), Q3) serum PTH was 164.0 (131.0, 211.0) pg/ml and mean (s.d.) serum Ca was 11.77 (0.46) mg/dl. Serum Ca normalized (\u226410.3\u200amg/dl) in 75.8% of cinacalcet- vs 0% of placebo-treated subjects (P<0.001). Corrected serum Ca decreased by \u22651.0\u200amg/dl from baseline in 84.8% of cinacalcet- vs 5.9% of placebo-treated subjects (P<0.001). Least squares mean (s.e.m.) plasma PTH change from baseline was -23.80% (4.18%) (cinacalcet) vs -1.01% (4.05%) (placebo) (P<0.001). Similar numbers of subjects in the cinacalcet and placebo groups reported adverse events (AEs) (27 vs 20) and serious AEs (three vs four). Most commonly reported AEs were nausea and muscle spasms.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that cinacalcet normalizes serum calcium in this PHPT population and appears to be well tolerated.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

The post hoc analyses presented here are done on individual items of the PDSS-2 and PDQ-8 for all patients and two subgroups (baseline symptomatic and highly symptomatic patients).\nRESULTS: Ten PDSS-2 and five PDQ-8 items show significant mean treatment difference versus placebo. In the overall population, items that most favor rotigotine in percentage of patients with improvement are 'limb pain causes waking' and 'uncomfortable in bed due to immobility' for PDSS-2; for PDQ-8, rotigotine is most favored in 'difficulty dressing', 'felt depressed' and 'difficulty getting around in public'. Among symptomatic and highly symptomatic patients, the PDSS-2 items that most favor rotigotine are both indicators of pain. On the PDQ-8, the two items most favored in symptomatic patients are 'difficulty dressing' and 'embarrassed in public due to PD', and in the highly symptomatic subgroup 'difficulty dressing' and 'difficulty getting around in public'.\nCONCLUSION: Though this trial was not powered for statistical subgroup analysis, these post hoc results indicate that treatment with rotigotine may benefit patients with sleep, pain, mood and quality-of-life issues.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

Patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS have elevated free serum levels of the cytokine lymphotoxin-like inducible protein that competes with glycoprotein D for herpesvirus entry on T cells (LIGHT; also known as TNFSF14). Such patients may benefit from LIGHT-neutralization therapy.METHODSThis randomized, double-blind, multicenter, proof-of-concept trial enrolled adults hospitalized with COVID-19-associated pneumonia and mild to moderate ARDS. Patients received standard of care plus a single dose of a human LIGHT-neutralizing antibody (CERC-002) or placebo. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients receiving CERC-002 who remained alive and free of respiratory failure through day 28. Safety was assessed via adverse event monitoring.RESULTSFor most of the 83 enrolled patients, standard of care included systemic corticosteroids (88.0%) or remdesivir (57.8%). A higher proportion of patients remained alive and free of respiratory failure through day 28 after receiving CERC-002 (83.9%) versus placebo (64.5%; P = 0.044), including in patients 60 years of age or older (76.5% vs. 47.1%, respectively; P = 0.042). Mortality rates were 7.7% (CERC-002) and 14.3% (placebo) on day 28 and 10.8% and 22.5%, respectively, on day 60. Treatment-emergent adverse events were less frequent with CERC-002 than placebo.CONCLUSIONFor patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS, adding CERC-002 to standard-of-care treatment reduces LIGHT levels and might reduce the risk of respiratory failure and death.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov NCT04412057.FUNDINGAvalo Therapeutics.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

This proof-of-concept study assessed efficacy, safety and tolerability of CBD-rich botanical extract in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients.\nMETHODS: Patients aged 18 years or older, with left-sided or extensive UC, Mayo scores of 4-10 (endoscopy scores \u22651), and on stable 5-aminosalicylic acid dosing, were randomized to 10-weeks' CBD-rich botanical extract or placebo capsules. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients in remission after treatment. Statistical testing was 2-sided, using a 10% significance level.\nRESULTS: Patients were less tolerant of CBD-rich botanical extract compared with placebo, taking on average one-third fewer capsules, and having more compliance-related protocol deviations (principally insufficient exposure), prompting identification of a per protocol (PP) analysis set. The primary endpoint was negative; end of treatment remission rates were similar for CBD-rich botanical extract (28%) and placebo (26%). However, PP analysis of total and partial Mayo scores favoured CBD-rich botanical extract (P = 0.068 and P = 0.038, respectively). Additionally, PP analyses of the more subjective physician's global assessment of illness severity, subject global impression of change, and patient-reported quality-of-life outcomes were improved for patients taking CBD-rich botanical extract (P = 0.069, P = 0.003, and P = 0.065, respectively). Adverse events (AEs) were predominantly mild/moderate with many in the CBD-rich botanical extract group potentially attributable to the \u22069-tetrahydrocannabinol content. A greater proportion of gastrointestinal-related AEs, indicative of UC worsening, was seen on placebo.\nCONCLUSION: Although the primary endpoint was not reached, several signals suggest CBD-rich botanical extract may be beneficial for symptomatic treatment of UC.\n## Response:\nFALSE"}

Primary endpoint was change in postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) exposure from baseline to day 28 during a breakfast test meal.\nRESULTS: Lixisenatide reduced PPG significantly more than liraglutide [mean change in AUC(0:30-4:30h) : -12.6 vs. -4.0\u2009h\u00b7mmol/L, respectively; p\u2009<\u20090.0001 (0:30\u2009h\u2009=\u2009start of meal)]. Change in maximum PPG excursion was -3.9\u2009mmol/l vs. -1.4\u2009mmol/l, respectively (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). More lixisenatide-treated patients achieved 2-h PPG <7.8\u2009mmol/l (69% vs. 29%). Changes in fasting plasma glucose were greater with liraglutide (-0.3 vs. -1.3\u2009mmol/l, p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Lixisenatide provided greater decreases in postprandial glucagon (p\u2009<\u20090.05), insulin (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and C-peptide (p\u2009<\u20090.0001).

Our aim in the REGARD (REbif vs Glatiramer Acetate in Relapsing MS Disease) study was to compare interferon beta-1a with glatiramer acetate in patients with RRMS.\nMETHODS: In this multicentre, randomised, comparative, parallel-group, open-label study, patients with RRMS diagnosed with the McDonald criteria who had had at least one relapse within the previous 12 months were randomised to receive 44 mug subcutaneous interferon beta-1a three times per week or 20 mg subcutaneous glatiramer acetate once per day for 96 weeks to assess the time to first relapse. A subpopulation of 460 patients (230 from each group) also had serial MRI scans to assess T2-weighted and gadolinium-enhancing lesion number and volume. Treatments were assigned by a computer-generated randomisation list that was stratified by centre. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00078338.\nFINDINGS: Between February and December, 2004, 764 patients were randomly assigned: 386 to interferon beta-1a and 378 to glatiramer acetate. After 96 weeks, there was no significant difference between groups in time to first relapse (hazard ratio 0.94, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.21; p=0.64). Relapse rates were lower than expected: 258 patients (126 in the interferon beta-1a group and 132 in the glatiramer acetate group) had one or more relapses (the expected number was 460). For secondary outcomes, there were no significant differences for the number and change in volume of T2 active lesions or for the change in the volume of gadolinium-enhancing lesions, although patients treated with interferon beta-1a had significantly fewer gadolinium-enhancing lesions (0.24 vs 0.41 lesions per patient per scan, 95% CI -0.4 to 0.1; p=0.0002). Safety and tolerability profiles were consistent with the known profiles for both compounds. The overall number and severity of adverse events were similar between the treatments and were not an important cause for discontinuation of the trial during the 96 weeks.\nINTERPRETATION: There was no significant difference between interferon beta-1a and glatiramer acetate in the primary outcome. The ability to predict clinical superiority on the basis of results from previous studies might be limited by a trial population with low disease activity, which is an important consideration for ongoing and future trials in patients with RRMS.\n## Response:\nFALSE"}

Side effects during the infusions have been common. It is not known whether serial infusions or lower infusion rates result in greater efficacy.\nMETHODS: Ten depressed patients were treated with twice weekly ketamine infusions of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg administered over 100 min until either remission was achieved or four infusions were given. Side effects were assessed with the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Patients were followed naturalistically at weekly intervals for four weeks after completion of the infusions.\nRESULTS: Five of 10 patients achieved remission status. There were no significant increases on the BPRS or YMRS. Two of the remitting patients sustained their improvement throughout the four week follow-up period.\nCONCLUSIONS: Ketamine infusions at a lower rate than previously reported have demonstrated similar efficacy and excellent tolerability and may be more practically available for routine clinical care. Serial ketamine infusions appear to be more effective than a single infusion.

This retrospective analysis of these trials investigated efficacy and toxicity of panitumumab-based maintenance after oxaliplatin discontinuation in RAS wild-type patients. First-line regimens were FOLFOX4 \u00b1 panitumumab in PRIME and mFOLFOX6 plus panitumumab or mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab in PEAK. Outcomes included median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), from randomisation and oxaliplatin discontinuation, and toxicity. Overall, median duration of panitumumab plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (5-FU/LV) maintenance was 21 (interquartile range: 11-41) weeks; that of 5-FU/LV \u00b1 bevacizumab maintenance was 16 (6-31) weeks. Median OS from randomisation was 40.2 (95% confidence interval: 30.3-50.4) and 39.1 (34.2-63.0) months for panitumumab plus 5-FU/LV maintenance and 24.1 (17.7-33.0) and 28.9 (21.0-32.0) months for 5-FU/LV \u00b1 bevacizumab maintenance in PRIME and PEAK, respectively.

From oxaliplatin discontinuation, median OS was 33.9 (24.7-42.8) and 33.5 (24.5-54.9) months for panitumumab plus 5-FU/LV maintenance and 16.4 (12.4-24.1) and 23.3 (15.7-26.3) months for 5-FU/LV \u00b1 bevacizumab maintenance in PRIME and PEAK, respectively; PFS was 11.7 (7.8-19.2) and 9.7 (5.8-14.8) months and 7.1 (5.6-10.2) and 7.0 (3.9-10.6) months, respectively. The most frequently reported adverse events were rash, fatigue and diarrhoea.

These infections may have highly morbid consequences to patients, who often endure additional surgeries and lengthy exposures to systemic antibiotics, neither of which are guaranteed to resolve the infection. Of particular concern is the threat of bacterial biofilm development, since biofilm-mediated infections are difficult to diagnose and effective treatments are lacking. Developing therapeutic strategies have targeted mechanisms of biofilm formation and the means by which these bacteria communicate with each other to take on specialized roles such as persister cells within the biofilm. In addition, prevention of infection through novel coatings for prostheses and the local delivery of high concentrations of antibiotics by absorbable carriers has shown promise in laboratory and animal studies. Biofilm development, especially in an arthoplasty environment, and future diagnostic and treatment options are discussed.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

The primary efficacy end points were time to hemostasis (TTH) and time to ambulation (TTA), and the primary safety end points were periprocedural and 30-day incidence of arterial access-related complications.\nRESULTS: The trial assigned 401 patients (mean age 62.7 +/- 10.9 years, 66.1% men) to VCD (n = 267) versus MC (n = 134) after 87 \"roll-in\" patients treated at 17 participating institutions. The baseline characteristics of the groups were similar. Procedural success was 91.8% in the VCD versus 91.0% in the MC group (p = NS). Mean TTH was 4.4 +/- 11.6 min in the VCD versus 20.1 +/- 22.5 min in the MC group (95% confidence interval: 19.0 to 12.3; p < 0.0001). Likewise, TTA was significantly shorter in the VCD (2.5 +/- 5.0 h) than in the MC (6.2 +/- 13.3 h) group (95% confidence interval: 5.5 to 1.9; p = 0.0028). No patient died or suffered a major access-site-related adverse event. Minor adverse events were few among all study groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: After 6-F percutaneous invasive procedures, TTH and TTA were both significantly shorter in patients assigned to VCD than in patients managed with MC.

Our study population comprised 932 veterans with 2 or more keratinocyte carcinomas in the 5 years prior to enrollment. The mean follow-up duration was 2.6 years in both treatment and control groups.\nINTERVENTIONS: Participants applied either topical fluorouracil cream, 5% (n\u2009=\u2009468), or vehicle control cream (n\u2009=\u2009464) to the face and ears twice daily for up to 4 weeks.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: This study reports on AK counts and treatments, which were secondary outcomes of the VAKCC trial. Actinic keratoses on the face and ears were counted by study dermatologists at enrollment and at study visits every 6 months. The number of spot treatments for AKs on the face and ears at semiannual study visits and in between study visits was recorded.\nRESULTS: The number of AKs on the face and ears per participant was not different between the fluorouracil and control groups at randomization (11.1 vs 10.6, P\u2009>\u2009.10). After randomization, the fluorouracil group had fewer AKs compared with the control group at 6 months (3.0 vs 8.1, P\u2009<\u2009.001) and for the overall study duration (P\u2009<\u2009.001). The fluorouracil group also had higher complete AK clearance rates (38% vs 17% at 6 months) and fewer spot treatments at 6-month intervals, at study visits, and in between study visits during the trial (P\u2009<\u2009.01 for all). The fluorouracil group took longer to require the first spot AK treatment (6.2 months) compared with the control group (6.0 months) (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.60-0.79). The number of hypertrophic AKs was not different between the 2 groups overall (P\u2009=\u2009.60), although there were fewer hypertrophic AKs in the fluorouracil group at 6 months (0.23 vs 0.41) (P\u2009=\u2009.05).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our results indicate that a single course of fluorouracil cream, 5%, effectively reduces AK counts and the need for spot treatments for longer than 2 years.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier:NCT00847912.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Twenty-five women with medication-resistant, urodynamic-confirmed idiopathic detrusor overactivity were enrolled. A total of 9 patients were treated in phase 1 of the study. Three patients were given a 66% dosing of solution; 22 patients received the full 300 units of botulinum toxin and 50 mL of DMSO (50% concentration). Adverse effects, 24-hour pad weights, episodes of incontinence, postvoid residuals, and scores on the Blaivas-Groutz anti-incontinence scale, Indevus Urgency Severity Scale, Incontinence Impact Questionnaire-short form, and Urogenital Distress Inventory (6 items) questionnaire were recorded at baseline, 1 month, and 3 months after instillation. No serious adverse effects or clinically important increases in postvoid residual occurred. Among the 21 women who completed phase 2 of the study, the median number of incontinent episodes decreased from 4 at baseline to 2 at 1 month (P=.004) and increased to 4 at 3 months (P=.81). Median scores improved from baseline to 1 month on the Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (from 13 to 7; P=.007) and Urogenital Distress Inventory (from 10 to 5; P=.003). Although 11 women (52%) reported severe urgency based on the Indevus Urgency Severity Scale at baseline, only 1 (5%; P<.001) and 3 (14%; P=.004) women reported severe scores at 1 and 3 months, respectively. Direct instillation of botulinum toxin/DMSO solution is safe. Its promising clinical effect warrants further evaluation in a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 setting.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

We made propensity-matched comparisons between patients who received and did not receive intraoperative transfusion to minimize confounding when estimating the effect of intraoperative transfusion on postoperative outcomes.\nSETTING: We queried the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database for patients undergoing operations between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2009.\nPATIENTS: A large sample of surgical patients from 173 hospitals throughout the United States.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Operative mortality and serious perioperative morbidity (\u22651 of 20 complications).\nRESULTS: After exclusions, 941,496 operations were analyzed in patients from 173 hospitals. Most patients (893,205 patients [94.9%]) did not receive intraoperative transfusions. Patients who received intraoperative infusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells (15,186 patients [1.6%]) had higher unadjusted rates of mortality and more serious morbidity. These rates further increased with intraoperative transfusion of more than 1 unit of packed red blood cells in a dose-dependent manner. After propensity matching to adjust for multiple preoperative risks, transfusion of a single unit of packed red blood cells increased the multivariate risk of mortality, wound problems, pulmonary complications, postoperative renal dysfunction, systemic sepsis, composite morbidity, and postoperative length of stay compared with propensity-matched patients who did not receive intraoperative transfusion.\nCONCLUSIONS: There is a dose-dependent adverse effect of intraoperative blood transfusion. It is likely that a small, possibly discretionary amount of intraoperative transfusion leads to increased mortality, morbidity, and resource use, suggesting that caution should be used with intraoperative transfusions for mildly hypovolemic or anemic patients.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Predictors and reasons for (non)usage are not well known. Identifying which factors are related to usage contributes to the recognition of subgroups who benefit most from Web-based interventions and to the development of new strategies to increase usage.\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of this mixed methods study was to explore patient, intervention, and study characteristics that facilitate or impede usage of a Web-based physical activity intervention for patients with knee and/or hip osteoarthritis.\nMETHODS: This study is part of a randomized controlled trial that investigated the effects of Web-based physical activity intervention. A total of 199 participants between 50-75 years of age with knee and/or hip osteoarthritis were randomly assigned to a Web-based intervention (n=100) or a waiting list (n=99). This mixed methods study used only data from the individuals allocated to the intervention group. Patients were defined as users if they completed at least 6 out of 9 modules. Logistic regression analyses with a stepwise backward selection procedure were executed to build a multivariate prediction usage model. For the qualitative part, semistructured interviews were conducted. Both inductive and deductive analyses were used to identify patterns in reported reasons for nonusage.\nRESULTS: Of the 100 participants who received a password and username, 46 completed 6 modules or more. Multivariate regression analyses revealed that higher age (OR 0.94, P=.08) and the presence of a comorbidity (OR 0.33, P=.02) predicted nonusage. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the model was robust to changes in the usage parameter. Results from the interviews showed that a lack of personal guidance, insufficient motivation, presence of physical problems, and low mood were reasons for nonusage. In addition, the absence of human involvement was viewed as a disadvantage and it negatively impacted program usage. Factors that influenced usage positively were trust in the program, its reliability, functionality of the intervention, social support from family or friends, and commitment to the research team.\nCONCLUSIONS: In this mixed methods study, we found patient, intervention, and study factors that were important in the usage and nonusage of a Web-based PA intervention for patients with knee and/or hip osteoarthritis. Although the self-guided components offer several advantages, particularly in relation to costs, reach, and access, we found that older patients and participants with a comorbid condition need a more personal approach. For these groups the integration of Web-based interventions in a health care environment seems to be promising.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Participants (18-65 y) had DSM-IV-TR-diagnosed MDD and lead-in baseline Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total scores \u226524. Eight-week antidepressant lead-in phases prospectively assessed antidepressant response. Then, 8 weeks of randomized (1:1), double-blind treatment with dose-optimized LDX (20-70mg) or placebo in participants exhibiting inadequate antidepressant monotherapy responses (augmentation baseline MADRS total scores \u226518 and <50% MADRS total score reductions from lead-in baseline to augmentation baseline) was initiated. The primary endpoint was MADRS total score change from augmentation baseline to week 16. Safety and tolerability measures included the occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs).\nRESULTS: Least squares mean (95% CI) treatment differences (LDX-placebo) for MADRS total score changes from augmentation baseline to week 16 were not statistically significant in study 1 (0.1 [-1.7, 2.0], P=0.883) or study 2 (-0.5 [-2.3, 1.3], P=0.583). The only TEAE reported by >5% of LDX participants at twice the placebo rate in both studies was dry mouth.\nLIMITATIONS: Limitations include the exclusion of participants with psychiatric comorbidities/active medical disorders, the inability to assess specific MDD symptom domains (eg, anhedonia, cognition) or subtypes, the use of telephone-based depression assessments, and the potential influence of placebo response.\nCONCLUSION: Contrary to expectations, LDX augmentation was not superior to placebo in reducing depressive symptoms in individuals with MDD exhibiting inadequate responses to antidepressant monotherapy.\n## Response:\nFALSE"}

In this study, we compared a reduction treatment approach with an immediate cessation approach in a population of ST users who reported no immediate plans to quit.\nMETHODS: Subjects randomly assigned to the immediate cessation condition set a quit date soon after enrollment and were offered 2 weeks of nicotine patch therapy to help in their cessation efforts. Subjects assigned to the ST reduction group were provided with their choice of either 4 mg nicotine lozenge or ST brand switching to help them reduce their ST use or levels of nicotine exposure, respectively. Quit date was 6 weeks after the onset of treatment. Follow-up was at 12 weeks and 26 weeks postenrollment and 26 weeks postquit.\nRESULTS: Both 7-day point prevalence abstinence and prolonged abstinence rates following the quit date were significantly higher in the immediate cessation group versus the reduction group at 12 and 26 weeks (all p values \u2264 .04) and for prolonged abstinence at 6 months postquit (p = .002). Significant reductions in ST use among nonquitters were observed for both groups (p < .0001) with no differences between groups.\nCONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that immediate cessation with an established quit date resulted in greater cessation success than a gradual reduction approach among ST users who do not have an immediate quit plan but are motivated to quit.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

This was a multi-national, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose 1-year study. Patients were randomized (1 : 1) to treatment with placebo or memantine. Patients randomized to memantine were up-titrated to the target dose of 20 mg/day over 4 weeks. MRI scans were collected at screening and at Weeks 4, 42, and 52. Secondary efficacy assessments included several cognitive and behavioral scales. 518 patients were screened, 278 patients were randomized, and 217 patients completed the study. In the primary efficacy analysis, the differences in TBA rates between memantine (15.2 mL/year) and placebo (15.3 mL/year) were not statistically significant (-0.04 mL/year [(95% CI: -2.60, 2.52), p = 0.98]). There was a statistically significant correlation between change in TBA and change in most cognitive and behavioral scale scores. Patients who were not treated with acetyl cholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) showed a significantly lower TBA rate than patients treated with AChEIs. Memantine had a placebo-level incidence of adverse events. There were no statistically significant differences between memantine and placebo in total brain or hippocampal atrophy rates in patients with probable AD treated for 1 year. The biological relevance of cerebral atrophy was supported by a significant correlation between rate of atrophy and decline in cognitive and behavioral outcomes.\n## Response:\nFALSE"}

While it is generally acknowledged that it is necessary to produce versions that are conceptually equivalent, the best method of achieving this is more controversial. It is commonly stated that there is a gold-standard method, which involves forward and backward translation. However, no evidence has been presented to support this view. This paper argues that the \"gold-standard\" method is difficult to support and describes an alternative method involving dual translation panels that has been used in the production of all adaptations of needs-based quality of life instruments.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

In this study, PAP was compared between MV and PCV at the same tidal volume of 8-10 ml/kg during facemask ventilation for anaesthetic induction in children. The occurrence of gastric insufflation (GI) was evaluated with ultrasonography and stethoscopic auscultation.\nMETHODS: Forty-eight children, aged 0.5-7 years, undergoing elective urologic surgery were randomly allocated into either Group MV or Group PCV. Under light sedation with thiopental iv., ultrasonography (US) was performed and the gastric antrum was identified. After additional thiopental and rocuronium administration, facemask ventilation with a tidal volume of 8-10 ml/kg was performed for 3 min, whereas respiratory parameters were recorded at 1 min intervals. Real-time US and stethoscopic auscultation were performed for evaluation of GI.\nRESULTS: In the MV group, PAP was higher at all the time points compared with the PCV group (14 vs. 9.5, 15 vs. 10 and 15 vs. 9 cmH2 O, all P < 0.05). However, there was no difference in the GI occurrence between Group MV and Group PCV (7 vs. 3, P = 0.284). There was no difference between PAP in patients with GI and without GI (P > 0.05). Ultrasonography was more sensitive in detecting GI than the stethoscopic auscultation (10 vs. 5). Gastric antral area was expanded after facemask ventilation in both groups, but there were no intergroup differences.\nCONCLUSION: Although PCV provided lower PAP than MV at the same tidal volume, the risk of GI may not be eliminated during facemask ventilation in paralysed small children.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

An expected average of 15 minutes.\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Ultrasound imaging of the spine has recently been proposed to facilitate identification of the epidural space. In this study, we assessed the accuracy and precision of the transverse approach, using a \"single-screen\" method, to facilitate labor epidurals.\nMETHODS: We enrolled 61 patients requesting labor epidurals. Ultrasound imaging (transverse approach, 2-5 MHz curved array probe) identified the midline, the intervertebral space, and the distance from the skin to the epidural space (ultrasound depth/UD). During the epidural puncture, we recorded the success of the insertion point, and measured the distance to the epidural space to the nearest half-centimeter of the marked Tuohy needle (needle depth/ND). We calculated the agreement between UD and ND by the concordance correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman analysis with 95% limits of agreement.\nRESULTS: The average maternal age was 33 +/- 4.6 yr, body mass index 29.7 +/- 4.8, UD 4.66 +/- 0.68 cm, and ND 4.65 +/- 0.72 cm. The success of the insertion point was 91.8%, with no need to redirect the needle in 73.8% of the patients. The concordance correlation coefficient between UD and ND was 0.881 (95% CI 0.820-0.942). The 95% limits of agreement were -0.666 to 0.687 cm.\nCONCLUSIONS: We found a good level of success in the ultrasound-determined insertion point, and very good agreement between UD and ND. This suggests that our proposed ultrasound single-screen method, using the transverse approach, can be a reliable guide to facilitate labor epidural insertion.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

In this study, we have determined and compared the in vitro optical properties of human epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous fat with those of nonmelanoma skin cancers in the spectral range from 370 to 1600 nm. Fresh specimens of normal and cancerous human skin were obtained from surgeries. The samples were rinsed in saline solution and sectioned. Diffuse reflectance and total transmittance were measured using an integrating sphere spectrophotometer. Absorption and reduced scattering coefficients were calculated from the measured quantities using an inverse Monte Carlo technique. The differences between optical properties of each normal tissue-cancer pair were statistically analyzed. The results indicate that there are significant differences in the scattering of cancerous and healthy tissues in the spectral range from 1050 to 1400 nm. In this spectral region, the scattering of cancerous lesions is consistently lower than that of normal tissues, whereas absorption does not differ significantly, with the exception of nodular basal cell carcinomas (BCC). Nodular BCCs exhibit significantly lower absorption as compared to normal skin. Therefore, the spectral range between 1050 and 1400 nm appears to be optimal for nonmelanoma skin cancer detection.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

However, investigation of the lipodystrophy syndrome has generally been limited to men; and a comprehensive evaluation of insulin, lipids, and regional body composition has not been performed in the expanding population of HIV-infected women. In this study, we assessed fasting insulin, lipid levels, virologic parameters, and regional body composition, using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, in a cohort of 75 HIV-infected women (age, 25-46 yr), in comparison with 30 healthy weight-matched premenopausal control subjects. HIV-infected women demonstrated significant truncal adiposity (38.5 +/- 0.9 vs. 34.9 +/- 1.3%, P < 0.05) hyperinsulinemia (15.9 +/- 1.5 vs. 7.5 +/- 0.6 microU/mL, P < 0.001) and an increased insulin-to-glucose ratio (0.2 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.1 +/- 0.03, P < 0.001), compared with control subjects. Insulin and the insulin-to-glucose ratio were increased, even among HIV-infected patients with low body weight (<90% of ideal body weight) (insulin, 13.3 +/- 2.8 microU/mL, P < 0.01 vs. control; insulin/glucose, 0.2 +/- 0.04, P < 0.01 vs. control). Insulin and the insulin-to-glucose ratio were most significantly elevated among patients with increased truncal adiposity (insulin, 28.2 +/- 3.2 microU/mL, P < 0.001 vs. control; insulin/ glucose, 0.32 +/- 0.04, P < 0.001 vs. control). In contrast, no differences in insulin were seen in relation to protease inhibitor (PI) use. Similarly, HIV-infected women also demonstrated significant hypertriglyceridemia (144 +/- 15 vs. 66 +/- 23 mg/dL, P < 0.01 vs. controls), which was present even among low-weight patients (148 +/- 32 mg/dL, P < 0.001 vs. control) but was not related to truncal adiposity or PI usage. These data demonstrate significant hyperinsulinemia and truncal adiposity in HIV-infected women. Our data suggest that these metabolic abnormalities occur at baseline in HIV-infected women, independent of PI use. However, these data do not rule out a direct effect of PI therapy on fat metabolism or indirect effects of PI therapy to further worsen glucose and lipid homeostasis in association with weight gain and disease recovery.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Week 12\nAbstract: CONTEXT: Dapagliflozin, a selective sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, reduces hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by increasing urinary glucose excretion, and weight loss is a consistent associated finding.\nOBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to confirm weight loss with dapagliflozin and establish through body composition measurements whether weight loss is accounted for by changes in fat or fluid components.\nDESIGN AND SETTING: This was a 24-wk, international, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with ongoing 78-wk site- and patient-blinded extension period at 40 sites in five countries.\nPATIENTS: Included were 182 patients with T2DM (mean values: women 63.3 and men 58.6 yr of age; hemoglobin A1c 7.17%, body mass index 31.9 kg/m2, and body weight 91.5 kg) inadequately controlled on metformin.\nINTERVENTION: Dapagliflozin 10 mg/d or placebo was added to open-label metformin for 24 wk.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary endpoint was total body weight (TBW) change from baseline at wk 24. Key secondary endpoints were waist circumference and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry total-body fat mass (FM) changes from baseline at wk 24, and patient proportion achieving body weight reduction of at least 5% at wk 24. In a subset of patients, magnetic resonance assessment of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and sc adipose tissue (SAT) volume and hepatic lipid content were also evaluated.\nRESULTS: At wk 24, placebo-corrected changes with dapagliflozin were as follows: TBW, -2.08 kg [95% confidence interval (CI)=-2.84 to -1.31; P<0.0001]; waist circumference, -1.52 cm (95% CI=-2.74 to -0.31; P=0.0143); FM, -1.48 kg (95% CI=-2.22 to -0.74; P=0.0001); proportion of patients achieving weight reduction of at least 5%, +26.2% (95% CI=15.5 to 36.7; P<0.0001); VAT, -258.4 cm3 (95% CI=-448.1 to -68.6; nominal P=0.0084); SAT, -184.9 cm3 (95% CI=-359.7 to -10.1; nominal P=0.0385). In the dapagliflozin vs. placebo groups, respectively, serious adverse events were reported in 6.6 vs. 1.1%; events suggestive of vulvovaginitis, balanitis, and related genital infection in 3.3 vs. 0%; and lower urinary tract infections in 6.6 vs. 2.2%.\nCONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin reduces TBW, predominantly by reducing FM, VAT and SAT in T2DM inadequately controlled with metformin.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Thirty-six outpatients with Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R-diagnosed dysthymic disorder, aged 23-65 years (mean\u00b1SD=44.7\u00b111 years), were randomly assigned to double-blind escitalopram (maximum dose 20\u2009mg/day) versus placebo for 12 weeks. Inclusion criteria included age 18-65 years and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score\u226512. We hypothesized that escitalopram would be superior to placebo in the HDRS-24 item total score at week 12. We also hypothesized the superiority of escitalopram over placebo for secondary measures, including the percentage of participants classified as responders and remitters, as well as social functioning (Social Adjustment Scale), clinical global impression-improvement, Global Assessment of Functioning Scale. Participants' baseline HDRS-24 averaged 23.4\u00b15.9. Final HDRS-24 scores at last observation carried forward did not differ significantly between escitalopram-treated (mean\u00b1SD=10.88\u00b15.83) and placebo-treated individuals (mean\u00b1SD=16.4\u00b16.34) (F=2.82, degrees of freedom=1,32, P=0.10). Significant differences favoring active medication were found on the Social Adjustment Scale and the Clinical Global Impression Severity and Global Assessment of Functioning Scale, but not in the percentages of responders or remitters. A larger study sample or higher escitalopram dose may show more significant placebo-medication differences.\n## Response:\nFALSE"}

The intervention followed an ecological framework and involved promotoras. We examined 12-month intervention effects, including accelerometer-based moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA; primary outcome) and secondary outcomes. We conducted the study from 2010 to 2016.\nRESULTS: Mixed effects analyses showed significant increases in accelerometer-based MVPA (effect size\u2009=\u20090.25) and self-report leisure-time MVPA (effect size\u2009=\u20090.38) among Latinas in the intervention versus comparison condition. Participants in the intervention condition had about 66% higher odds of meeting the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines, had reduced body mass index (effect size\u2009=\u20090.23), and used more behavioral strategies for engaging in physical activity (effect size\u2009=\u20090.42). Program attendance was associated with increased self-reported leisure-time MVPA and the number of motivational interviewing calls was associated with meeting the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines.\nCONCLUSIONS: A faith-based intervention was effective in increasing MVPA and decreasing body mass index among participants. Process analyses showed the value of program attendance and motivational interviewing calls.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

As per protocol, all patients had a standardized evaluation to assess wound depth, sensory neuropathy, vascular insufficiency, and infection. Patients were assessed at 6 months after their initial evaluation to see whether an amputation had been performed.\nRESULTS: There was a significant overall trend toward increased prevalence of amputations as wounds increased in both depth (chi 2trend = 143.1, P < 0.001) and stage (chi 2trend = 91.0, P < 0.001). This was true for every subcategory as well with the exception of noninfected, nonischemic ulcers. There were no amputations performed within this stage during the follow-up period. Patients were more than 11 times more likely to receive a midfoot or higher level amputation if their wound probed to bone (18.3 vs. 2.0%, P < 0.001, chi 2 = 31.5, odds ratio (OR) = 11.1, CI = 4.0-30.3). Patients with infection and ischemia were nearly 90 times more likely to receive a midfoot or higher amputation compared with patients in less advanced wound stages (76.5 vs. 3.5%, P < 0.001, chi 2 = 133.5, OR = 89.6, CI = 25-316).\nCONCLUSIONS: Outcomes deteriorated with increasing grade and stage of wounds when measured using the University of Texas Wound Classification System.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

All continued with MET treatment, and those treated with SU continued if randomized to SITA + MET \u00b1 SU. Efficacy endpoints included glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 9-point self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG), weight, body mass index (BMI). Safety endpoints included adverse events (AEs) and hypoglycaemia.\nRESULTS: Significantly higher reductions in HbA1c, FPG and SMPG were achieved with IDet + SITA + MET compared with SITA + MET \u00b1 SU. Estimated HbA1c decreased by 1.44% in the IDet + SITA + MET group versus 0.89% in SITA + MET \u00b1 SU, p < 0.001. FPG decreased by 3.7 mmol/l (66.3 mg/dl) versus 1.2 mmol/l (22.2 mg/dl), p < 0.001, respectively. Small decreases in weight and BMI were observed in both arms, with no significant differences. AEs were mild or moderate and were more common in the SITA + MET \u00b1 SU arm than in the IDet + SITA + MET arm. There was no major hypoglycaemia. Observed rates of hypoglycaemia were very low (1.3/1.7 episodes/patient year) in both arms. The subgroup treated with MET and SUs prior to the trial achieved similar results.\nCONCLUSIONS: The combination of once-daily IDet with SITA showed a clinically and significantly better improvement in glycaemic control than SITA in combination with or without SUs. Both regimens were associated with a low rate of hypoglycaemia and slight weight reduction.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

The 'Trier Social Stress Test' (TSST) mainly consists of an anticipation period (10 min) and a test period (10 min) in which the subjects have to deliver a free speech and perform mental arithmetic in front of an audience. In six independent studies this protocol has been found to induce considerable changes in the concentration of ACTH, cortisol (serum and saliva), GH, prolactin as well as significant increases in heart rate. As for salivary cortisol levels, the TSST reliably led to 2- to 4-fold elevations above baseline with similar peak cortisol concentrations. Studies are summarized in which TSST-induced cortisol increases elucidated some of the multiple variables contributing to the interindividual variation in adrenocortical stress responses. The results suggest that gender, genetics and nicotine consumption can influence the individual's stress responsiveness to psychological stress while personality traits showed no correlation with cortisol responses to TSST stimulation. From these data we conclude that the TSST can serve as a tool for psychobiological research.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

The co-primary efficacy endpoint was the change in the KOOS pain and function subscores from baseline to 2 years. Histological evaluation and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessments of structural repair tissue, treatment failure, the remaining 3 KOOS subscales, and safety were also assessed.\nRESULTS: Of the 144 patients treated, 137 (95%) completed the 2-year assessment. Patients had a mean age of 33.8 years and a mean lesion size of 4.8 cm(2). The mean KOOS pain and function subscores from baseline to 2 years were significantly more improved with MACI than with MFX (pain: MACI, 37.0 to 82.5 vs MFX, 35.5 to 70.9; function: MACI, 14.9 to 60.9 vs MFX, 12.6 to 48.7; P = .001). A significant improvement in scores was also observed on the KOOS subscales of activities of daily living (MACI, 43.5 to 87.2 vs MFX, 42.6 to 75.8; P < .001), knee-related quality of life (MACI, 18.8 to 56.2 vs MFX, 17.2 to 47.3; P = .029), and other symptoms (MACI, 48.3 to 83.7 vs MFX, 44.4 to 72.2; P < .001) for patients treated with MACI compared with MFX. Repair tissue quality was good as assessed by histology/MRI, but no difference was shown between treatments. A low number of treatment failures (nonresponders: MACI, 12.5% vs MFX, 31.9%; P = .016) and no unexpected safety findings were reported.\nCONCLUSION: The treatment of symptomatic cartilage knee defects \u22653 cm(2) in size using MACI was clinically and statistically significantly better than with MFX, with similar structural repair tissue and safety, in this heterogeneous patient population. Moreover, MACI offers a more efficacious alternative than MFX with a similar safety profile for the treatment of symptomatic articular cartilage defects of the knee.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

Seven hundred and eighteen patients (placebo=360; nalmefene=358), \u2265 18 years of age, with a diagnosis of alcohol dependence, \u2265 6 heavy drinking days and an average alcohol consumption \u2265 WHO medium drinking risk level in the 4 weeks preceding screening, were randomised (1:1) to 24 weeks of as-needed placebo or nalmefene 18 mg/day. The co- primary efficacy analyses showed a significantly superior effect of nalmefene compared to placebo in the change from baseline to month 6 in heavy drinking days (group difference: -1.7 days/month [95% CI -3.1; -0.4]; p=0.012) and a better but not significant effect in reducing total alcohol consumption (group difference: -5.0 g/day last month [95% CI -10.6; 0.7]; p=0.088). A subgroup analysis showed that patients who did not reduce their drinking prior to randomisation benefitted more from nalmefene. Improvements in Clinical Global Impression and reductions in liver enzymes were greater in the nalmefene group than in the placebo group. Adverse events were more common with nalmefene; the incidence of adverse events leading to dropout was similar in both groups. This study provides evidence for the efficacy of nalmefene, which constitutes a new pharmacological treatment paradigm in terms of treatment goal (reduced drinking) and dosing regimen (as-needed), in alcohol dependent patients unable to reduce alcohol consumption on their own.\n## Response:\nFALSE"}

One hundred thirty-eight Black and mixed-race mother-father dyads participated. Coparent dyads were randomly assigned to either a treatment as usual (TAU) group, receiving referrals and navigation support to existing community services (control), or to TAU plus invitation to a series of six dyadic Focused Coparenting Consultation (FCC) sessions led by a male-female mentor team (intervention). Seventy-one percent of those prenatally assessed were later reassessed at 3 months postpartum. Both mothers and fathers contributed reports of coparenting, father engagement, physical and psychological intimate partner violence (IPV), and depressive symptoms. Intent-to-treat analyses indicated: (a) some evidence that mothers in the intervention group reported more positive coparenting communication at 3 months postpartum than did control group mothers; (b) mothers in the intervention group reported significantly more time spent by fathers with the child than did control group mothers; (c) parents in the intervention group had significant reductions in psychological IPV compared to parents in the control group; and (d) both mothers and fathers showed reductions in self-reported depression over time, with no differential impact of group. Findings suggest that the FCC intervention may produce modest but important benefits for unmarried, low-income Black coparents in the transition to parenthood.

Results in the literature are still contradictory as to the degree and specificity of acupuncture analgesia and its opioid nature. Acupuncture techniques as well as experimental pain models are factors accounting for the discrepancies in the results. For this reason, we designed an experimental pain test characterized by a high degree of specificity, validity and reliability. We chose optimal conditions for eliciting specific acupuncture effect, i.e. non-segmental, low frequency and painful intensity range. A cross-over repeated measure experimental design was used. Five normal trained subjects participated in 65 sessions under four conditions (control, EA, EA+naloxone, EA+placebo). Changes in experimental dental pain thresholds served as indices of analgesia. The results indicated a 27% pain threshold increase after 30 minutes of EA stimulation (p less than .0001), with no differential effect between pain detection (mild pain sensation) and pain discomfort (strong pain sensation). This increase was partially blocked by the double blind injection of 0.8 mg naloxone IM (p less than .005). The experiment was designed in such a way as to prevent the occurrence of a stress analgesic effect. The endogenous opioid system was shown to be partially involved in acupuncture analgesia. Other mechanisms of action are discussed in view of the literature findings.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of overall responders.\nRESULTS: Using an intent-to-treat analysis with last observation carried forward, a significantly higher percentage of lubiprostone-treated patients were considered overall responders compared with those treated with placebo (17.9% vs. 10.1%, P=0.001). Patients treated with lubiprostone reported a similar incidence of adverse events to those treated with placebo.\nCONCLUSIONS: The percentage of overall responders based on patient-rated assessments of IBS-C symptoms was significantly improved in patients treated with lubiprostone 8 mcg twice daily compared to those treated with placebo. Lubiprostone was well tolerated with a favourable safety profile.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

To conduct a randomized treatment trial of levetiracetam for the first-line treatment of neonatal seizures (the NEOLEV2 trial), we developed a monitoring infrastructure at five NICUs, implementing recent technological advancements to provide continuous video EEG monitoring and real-time response to seizure detection. Here, we report on the feasibility of providing this level of care.\nMETHODS: Twenty-five key informant interviews were conducted with study neurologists, neonatologists, coordinators, and EEG technicians from the commercial EEG monitoring company Corticare. A general inductive approach was used to analyze these qualitative data.\nRESULTS: A robust infrastructure for continuous video EEG monitoring, remote review, and real-time seizure detection was established at all sites. At the time of this survey, 260 babies had been recruited and monitored for 2 to 6 days. The EEG technician review by the commercial EEG monitoring company was reassuring to families and neonatologists and led to earlier detection of seizures but did not reduce work load for neurologists. Neurologists found the automated neonatal seizure detector algorithm provided by the EEG software company Persyst useful, but the accuracy of the algorithm was not such that it could be used without review by human expert. Placement of EEG electrodes to initiate monitoring, especially after hours, remains problematic.\nCONCLUSIONS: Technological advancements have made it possible to provide at-risk neonates with continuous video EEG monitoring, real-time detection of and response to seizures. However, this standard of care remains unfeasible in usual clinical practice. Chief obstacles remain starting a recording and resourcing the real-time specialist review of suspect seizures.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

(ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00395083) SETTING: 20 Veterans Affairs hospital-based outpatient clinics.\nPARTICIPANTS: Patients hospitalized for COPD in the past year.\nINTERVENTION: The CCMP included COPD education during 4 individual sessions and 1 group session, an action plan for identification and treatment of exacerbations, and scheduled proactive telephone calls for case management. Patients in both the intervention and usual care groups received a COPD informational booklet; their primary care providers received a copy of COPD guidelines and were advised to manage their patients according to these guidelines. Patients were randomly assigned, stratifying by site based on random, permuted blocks of variable size.\nMEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was time to first COPD hospitalization. Staff blinded to study group performed telephone-based assessment of COPD exacerbations and hospitalizations, and all hospitalizations were blindly adjudicated. Secondary outcomes included non-COPD health care use, all-cause mortality, health-related quality of life, patient satisfaction, disease knowledge, and self-efficacy.\nRESULTS: Of the eligible patients, 209 were randomly assigned to the intervention group and 217 to the usual care group. Citing serious safety concerns, the data monitoring committee terminated the intervention before the trial's planned completion after 426 (44%) of the planned total of 960 patients were enrolled. Mean follow-up was 250 days. When the study was stopped, the 1-year cumulative incidence of COPD-related hospitalization was 27% in the intervention group and 24% in the usual care group (hazard ratio, 1.13 [95% CI, 0.70 to 1.80]; P= 0.62). There were 28 deaths from all causes in the intervention group versus 10 in the usual care group (hazard ratio, 3.00 [CI, 1.46 to 6.17]; P= 0.003). Cause could be assigned in 27 (71%) deaths. Deaths due to COPD accounted for the largest difference: 10 in the intervention group versus 3 in the usual care group (hazard ratio, 3.60 [CI, 0.99 to 13.08]; P= 0.053).\nLIMITATIONS: Available data could not fully explain the excess mortality in the intervention group. Ability to assess the quality of the educational sessions provided by the case managers was limited.\nCONCLUSION: A CCMP in patients with severe COPD had not decreased COPD-related hospitalizations when the trial was stopped prematurely. The CCMP was associated with unanticipated excess mortality, results that differ markedly from similar previous trials. A data monitoring committee should be considered in the design of clinical trials involving behavioral interventions.\n## Response:\nFALSE"}

A trial is under way to evaluate the effect of once-daily fenofibric acid or placebo on carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) progression in patients with controlled low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels achieved through atorvastatin treatment, but with high TG and low HDL-C levels.\nMETHODS: In this multicenter, double-blind study, 682 patients were randomized to once-daily delayed-release capsules of choline fenofibrate 135 mg (fenofibric acid [Trilipix(\u00ae); Abbott, North Chicago, IL]) or placebo plus atorvastatin treatment after a 2- to 10-week diet and atorvastatin run-in period. Key inclusion criteria included age \u226545 years; posterior-wall common CIMT \u22650.7 mm on at least one side at baseline; fasting results of TG \u2265150 mg/dL, and HDL-C \u226445 mg/dL for men or HDL-C \u226455 mg/dL for women at screening while receiving atorvastatin; controlled LDL-C; and known coronary heart disease (CHD) or a CHD risk equivalent. The primary efficacy variable is the rate of change from baseline through week 104 in the mean posterior-wall intima-media thickness of the common carotid arteries (composite value of left and right sides).\nCONCLUSIONS: This trial is the first to examine the effect of fenofibric acid on CIMT and the first CIMT trial to select patients with controlled LDL-C and elevated TG and low HDL-C as inclusion criteria. Also, this trial will prospectively evaluate the effect of treatment on LDL particles and address shortcomings of previous CIMT trials.\n## Response:\nFALSE"}

We hypothesized that perioperative treatment with pregabalin, a chronic pain medication, would reduce the incidence of postsurgical neuropathic pain.\nMETHODS: We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of pregabalin (300 mg) administered before TKA and for 14 days after TKA (150-50 mg twice daily). Patients were screened for the presence of neuropathic pain at 3 and 6 mo postoperatively using the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs scale. Secondary outcomes included postsurgical recovery and rehabilitation measures, including knee range of motion, opioid consumption, postoperative pain scores, sleep disturbance, and time to discharge as well as the occurrence of postoperative systemic complications.\nRESULTS: Of the 240 patients randomly assigned to the 2 treatment groups (120 in each), data for the primary outcome were obtained from 113 pregabalin patients and 115 placebo patients. At both 3 and 6 mo postoperatively, the incidence of neuropathic pain was less frequent in the pregabalin group (0%) compared with the placebo group (8.7% and 5.2% at 3 and 6 mo, respectively; P = 0.001 and P = 0.014). Patients receiving pregabalin also consumed less epidural opioids (P = 0.003), required less oral opioid pain medication while hospitalized (P = 0.005), and had greater active flexion over the first 30 postoperative days (P = 0.013). There were no differences in the actual recorded duration of hospitalization between the 2 groups, although time to achieve hospital discharge criteria was longer for placebo patients, 69.0 +/- 16.0 h (mean +/- SD), than that of pregabalin patients, 60.2 +/- 15.8 h (P = 0.001). Sedation (P = 0.005) and confusion (P = 0.013) were more frequent on the day of surgery and postoperative day 1 in patients receiving pregabalin.\nCONCLUSION: Perioperative pregabalin administration reduces the incidence of chronic neuropathic pain after TKA, with less opioid consumption and better range of motion during the first 30 days of rehabilitation. However, in the doses tested, it is associated with a higher risk of early postoperative sedation and confusion.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

However, data regarding the symptoms noted in DSM-IV and timing of their expression in the menstrual cycle have had little empirical support.\nOBJECTIVE: To provide evidence informing the definitional criteria for PMDD.\nDESIGN: Prospective surveys.\nSETTING: General community and clinical settings.\nPARTICIPANTS: Two cohorts that included a representative sample and a self-identified treatment-seeking cohort. Main Outcome Measure\u00a0 Daily ratings of perimenstrual symptoms and functioning.\nRESULTS: Mood and physical symptoms were most severe and were accompanied by impairment in the 4 days before through the first 2 days of menses for the self-identified group and in the 3 days before through the first 3 days of menses in the community sample. The most problematic symptoms endorsed were those listed in DSM-IV, but depressed mood was less frequent than other affective symptoms. In the combined sample, 4 or more symptoms was the optimal cutoff point for maximizing both sensitivity and specificity when predicting impairment.\nCONCLUSIONS: This is informative for DSM-5 in that the most symptomatic period typically includes the few days before through the first 3 days of menses rather than only the premenstrual phase. Further, we validated the salience of PMDD symptoms included in DSM-IV. Although the number of symptoms most associated with distress and impairment differed between the 2 cohorts, results from the combined cohort suggest that 4 symptoms are linked with impairment from PMDD symptoms.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

However, electronic monitoring may not only measure adherence, but may also improve or impede adherence, making it difficult to assess the extent to which the observed effect size is attributed to the intervention versus electronic monitoring. This study examined whether electronic monitoring and patient diaries alter as well as measure adherence.\nMETHOD: A sample of 180 patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) were randomized to one of three adherence surveillance methods (electronic monitoring caps, patient medication diaries, no surveillance control group) for 4 weeks, with adherence measured by a structured interview at baseline and study endpoint; 173 (96%) participants completed the study.\nRESULTS: After controlling for baseline adherence, a univariate analyses of adherence at study endpoint revealed no significant differences across groups, F(2, 169) = 0.32, p =.73, with mean adherence rates of 91.4, 92.4, and 93.8 for the electronic monitoring, diaries, and control group, respectively. Similarly, the proportion of participants with good adherence (> or = 95%) did not differ significantly from baseline to week 4 among all three subgroups.\nCONCLUSION: These results suggest that electronic monitoring caps and medication diaries do not alter adherence and can be used as outcome measures of interventions without the need to adjust the observed effect size.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

The present data, obtained from chronically instrumented fetal lambs, includes three fetuses monitored throughout spontaneous labour, six fetuses with spontaneously developed long-term ST waveform changes and another three fetuses which died in the post-operative period. Uterine contractions could by themselves cause an increase in T wave height (T/QRS ratio greater than 0.30). If the ST elevation was normalised between contractions the fetus seemed to compensate to a moderate degree of hypoxia. When oxygenation was further reduced the T wave remained elevated between contractions and a progressive increase occurred in the T/QRS ratio (greater than 0.60) during the final stages of labour, in parallel with increasing blood lactate levels. Long-term ST changes with T/QRS consistently exceeding 0.30 were found to be related to low haemoglobin levels and/or fetal hypotension. Subsequently, all these fetuses died during labour as compared with a survival rate of 40% in fetuses showing a normal ST waveform. In this group negative T waves are reported as a sign of failing myocardial response to hypoxia. Death in utero, whatever the cause (bleeding, infection or spontaneous hypoxia) was always preceded by marked ST waveform changes. It is concluded that ST elevation with high peaked T waves can appear on a long-term basis in fetuses with intrauterine complications.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Whether or not these benefits are attributable to\u00a0reduction in plaque lipid content remains to be properly documented in human obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD).\nMETHODS: We randomized 87 patients with multivessel CAD undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention and at least 1 other severely obstructive (fractional flow reserve [FFR]\u00a0\u22640.8) nontarget lesion (NTL) to intensive (rosuvastatin 40\u00a0mg daily) or standard-of-care lipid-lowering therapy. NTLs were evaluated at baseline and after 7 weeks of therapy with FFR, near-infrared spectroscopy, and intravascular ultrasound. The primary endpoint was the change in lipid-core burden index at the 4-mm maximal segment (LCBI4mm max), wherever this occurred within the lesion.\nRESULTS: Upon follow-up, median reduction (95% confidence interval) in LCBI4mm max was significantly greater in the intensive versus standard group (-149.1 [-210.9 to -42.9] vs. 2.4 [-36.1 to 44.7]; p\u00a0= 0.01). Results remained consistent after adjustment for\u00a0baseline differences in LCBI between groups and use of change in LCBI across the entire lesion as the dependent outcome.\nCONCLUSIONS: Short-term intensive statin therapy may reduce lipid content in obstructive lesions.

Average over 4 weeks\nAbstract: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a lifelong and recurrent illness, such that many individuals require multiple courses of antidepressant medication treatment. While some patients respond completely to each course of treatment, many do not, and with each unsuccessful antidepressant trial the likelihood that a patient will respond decreases. This raises the possibility that neurophysiologic response in subsequent antidepressant treatment may be influenced by learning processes including sensitization, habituation, and/or classical conditioning. Classical conditioning would entail the association of cues such as pill-taking (conditioned stimuli; CS) with the effects of active medication (unconditioned stimulus; US), such that later presentation of the CS alone would come to elicit a conditioned response (CR). Such effects could be revealed by blinded administration of placebo following a period of treatment with active medication. Habituation effects (tolerance), or sensitization effects (increased response), which require only repeated exposure to a stimulus, might be evidenced after repeated courses of antidepressant treatment. Knowledge of how learning processes impact neurophysiologic response to successive courses of antidepressant treatment would have relevance for clinical populations. Specific hypotheses, however, may be tested in healthy non-clinical samples to avoid potential confounding factors related to severity or chronicity of illness. Learning theories would suggest two hypotheses: (1) neurophysiologic response to placebo will differ between subjects who were previously treated with antidepressant treatment as compared to placebo (classical conditioning hypothesis); and (2) neurophysiologic response to an initial course of antidepressant treatment will differ from response to a repeated course of antidepressant treatment. Pilot data addressed these hypotheses in healthy never-depressed women who had previously received four weeks of venlafaxine IR, 150 mg (antidepressant-experienced subjects; n=2) or matching placebo (antidepressant-naive subjects; n=4) under double-blind conditions. Six-and-a-half years later, we treated these six women with placebo for one week, followed by four weeks of double-blind treatment with venlafaxine IR, 150 mg. Brain functional changes over the course of treatment were assessed using quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) to compare prefrontal neurophysiologic responses between subjects who had, versus had not, previously been exposed to venlafaxine. Antidepressant-experienced versus antidepressant-naive subjects showed greater decreases in prefrontal cordance (PFC) during venlafaxine administration (sensitization hypothesis) but did not show significantly different PFC changes during treatment with placebo in this small pilot sample (classical conditioning hypothesis). Data suggest that brief treatment with antidepressant medication may have an enduring impact on neurophysiologic responses to a subsequent course of antidepressant treatment. Hypotheses should be tested in larger samples.\n## Response:\nFALSE"}

These problems can severely affect individuals' quality of life. In our prior research, we have developed indicators to measure the quality of care delivered to patients with Parkinson's disease, and we identified gaps in delivering evidence-based treatments for this population. Effective strategies to close these gaps are needed to improve patient quality of life.\nMETHODS/DESIGN: Building on prior research we developed a multi-faceted proactive implementation program called Care Coordination for Health Promotion and Activities in Parkinson's Disease (CHAPS). To be eligible, patients had to have at least two visits with a primary diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (ICD-9 code: 332.0) at one of five Veterans Affairs Medical Centers in the southwestern United States from 2010 to 2014. The program consists of telephone assessments, evidence-based protocols, and tools to enhance patient self-management, care planning, and coordination of care across providers, including an electronic database to support and track coordination of care. Our mixed-methods study employs a randomized, controlled trial design to test whether the CHAPS intervention improves performance in 38 quality measures among an analytic sample of 346 patients. The 38 quality measures are categorized into overarching areas of communication, education, and continuity; regulatory reporting; diagnosis; periodic assessment; medication use; management of motor and non-motor symptoms; use of non-pharmacological approaches and therapies; palliative care; and health maintenance. Secondary outcomes are patient health-related quality of life, self-efficacy, and perceptions of care quality. We are also evaluating the extent of the CHAPS Program implementation and measuring program costs and impacts on health services utilization, in order to perform a analysis of the CHAPS program from the perspective of the Veterans Health Administration (VA). Outcomes are assessed by interviewer-administered surveys collected at baseline and at 6, 12, and 18 months, and by medical record chart abstractions. Analyses will be intention-to-treat.\nDISCUSSION: The CHAPS Program is poised for dissemination within the VA National Parkinson's Disease Research, Education, and Clinical Center Consortium if demonstrated efficacious.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01532986; registered on January 13, 2012.\n## Response:\nFALSE"}

Thirty-three patients were randomized to receive methotrexate in Phase 2. Thirty-four patients received prednisone and placebo.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Adverse events (AE) in patients treated with prednisone only.\nRESULTS: Of 116 patients, 7 had to stop prednisone therapy during the 1-month challenge phase due to AE. Of 34 patients, 5 were unable to complete the full 22-week course of prednisone due to AE. The most common AE was hyperglycemia, which occurred in 17.6% of patients participating in Phase 2. Weight gain was also common, with a mean increase in body mass index of 1.6 kg/m2 (95% confidence interval, 0.77-2.3) during the 22-week steroid course. Patients entering Phase 2 were followed for a mean of 66 weeks. No fractures or osteonecrosis were reported.\nCONCLUSION: Although high-dose corticosteroids are associated with known serious side effects, prospective data in the literature are limited. The present study suggests that with appropriate patient selection, monitoring, and patient education, high-dose corticosteroids are a safe and effective treatment of AIED.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Before hysterectomy, patients completed the Fibromyalgia Survey, a validated measure of centralized pain. After hysterectomy, opioid use (converted to oral morphine equivalents) and pain scores (0-10 numeric rating scale) were collected by a daily diary and a structured telephone interview 14 days after surgery. Primary outcomes were total opioid prescribed and consumed in the 2 weeks after hysterectomy. Secondary outcomes included daily opioid use and daily pain severity for 14 days after hysterectomy.\nRESULTS: Of 103 eligible patients, 102 (99%) agreed to participate, including 44 (43.1%) laparoscopic, 42 (41.2%) vaginal, and 16 (15.7%) abdominal hysterectomies. Telephone surveys were completed on 89 (87%) participants; diaries were returned from 60 (59%) participants. Diary nonresponders had different baseline characteristics than nonresponders. Median amount of opioid prescribed was 200 oral morphine equivalents (interquartile range 150-250). Patients reported using approximately half of the opioids prescribed with a median excess of 110 morphine equivalents (interquartile range 40-150). The best fit model of total opioid consumption identified preoperative Fibromyalgia Survey Score, overall body pain, preoperative opioid use, prior endometriosis, abdominal hysterectomy (compared with laparoscopic), and uterine weight as significant predictors. Highest tertile of Fibromyalgia Survey Score was associated with greater daily opioid consumption (13.9 [95% CI 3.0-24.8] greater oral morphine equivalents at baseline, P=.02).\nCONCLUSION: Gynecologists at a large academic medical center prescribe twice the amount of opioids than the average patient uses after hysterectomy. A personalized approach to prescribing opioids for postoperative pain should be considered.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Unfortunately, the study of the patellofemoral joint is complicated by the use of expressions that hold different meanings for different readers. Ideally, the community of musculoskeletal physicians should agree on a single definition of terms, but until then, authors and speakers should define their terms clearly. Some terms, such as chondromalacia and patellofemoral syndrome, should be abandoned altogether. I propose a glossary of confusing terms pertaining to the patellofemoral joint, the various interpretations of these terms, and possible resolutions of these conflicts. Words and terms included in this review include chondromalacia, patellofemoral syndrome, anterior knee pain, subluxation, malalignment, proximal realignment, Roux procedure, and \"normal.\"\n## Response:\nNONE"}

We explored feasibility of in-home video monitoring and feedback to help caregivers and reduce caregiving burden. A caregiver-patient dyad was recruited from a Midwestern University Alzheimer's Disease Center. The caregiver triggered video recordings on a laptop computer using a remote control that also recorded 5 min prior to pressing \"record.\" Recordings were automatically uploaded via the Internet for interdisciplinary team review and feedback. Issues related to Internet transfer and storage of health information and computer security were addressed. Professionals reported the value of video recordings for identifying antecedents and evaluating caregiver responses. The caregiver reported improved communication and behavior management and ease of use.

Sixty-eight women and 52 men were reexamined after 9.7 +/- 1.1 years. The rates of decline in isokinetic strength averaged 14% per decade for knee extensors and 16% per decade for knee flexors in men and women. Women demonstrated slower rates of decline in elbow extensors and flexors (2% per decade) than men (12% per decade). Older subjects demonstrated a greater rate of decline in strength. In men, longitudinal rates of decline of leg muscle strength were approximately 60% greater than estimates from a cross-sectional analysis in the same population. The change in leg strength was directly related to the change in muscle mass in both men and women, and it was inversely related to the change in medication use in men. Physical activity declined yet was not directly associated with strength changes. Although muscle mass changes influenced the magnitude of the strength changes over time, strength declines in spite of muscle mass maintenance or even gain emphasize the need to explore the contribution of other cellular, neural, or metabolic mediators of strength changes.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Most potentially eligible patients were identified through electronic medical record queries or referral to a diabetes resource hub. Trial enrollees had a usual source of primary care, elevated body mass index (BMI) and type 2 diabetes. I-D-HEALTH participants were randomized to either standard care alone or standard care plus free-of-charge access to a group-based lifestyle intervention (GLI) offered by the YMCA. GLI participation was encouraged, but not required, for the latter group. The primary outcome is percent weight change over 6, 12 and 24months. Secondary outcomes include direct intervention costs and direct medical and non-medical expenditures, as well as changes in systolic blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c and cholesterol. Among 331 I-D-HEALTH participants, 167 were randomized to standard care and 164 to GLI. The mean age (\u00b1standard deviation) in each group was 57.1years (\u00b112.2) and 57.6years (\u00b110.5), respectively. Mean BMI was 34.9kg/m(2) (\u00b17.3) among standard care participants and 36.2kg/m(2) (\u00b17.8) among GLI participants. In both groups, approximately one third of participants were non-Hispanic Whites. We detected no significant differences between groups in mean systolic blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c or total cholesterol (P >0.05 for all characteristics above). The I-D-HEALTH study enrolled a diverse sample of adults with diabetes and offers a unique opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of offering a community-based intensive lifestyle intervention.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

Randomised sham-controlled trials of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and theta-burst stimulation (TBS), without co-initiation of another treatment, were included. We analysed effects on response, remission, all-cause discontinuation rates and continuous depression severity measures. Fifty-six studies met our criteria for inclusion (N\u202f=\u202f3058, mean age\u202f=\u202f44.96 years, 61.73% female). Response rates demonstrated efficacy of high-frequency rTMS over the left DLPFC (OR\u202f=\u202f3.75, 95% CI [2.44; 5.75]), right-sided low-frequency rTMS (OR\u202f=\u202f7.44, 95%CI [2.06; 26.83]) bilateral rTMS (OR\u202f=\u202f3.68,95%CI [1.66; 8.13]), deep TMS (OR\u202f=\u202f1.69, 95%CI [1.003; 2.85]), intermittent TBS (OR\u202f=\u202f4.70, 95%CI [1.14; 19.38]) and tDCS (OR\u202f=\u202f4.17, 95% CI [2.25; 7.74]); but not for continuous TBS, bilateral TBS or synchronised TMS. There were no differences in all-cause discontinuation rates. The strongest evidence was for high-frequency rTMS over the left DLPFC. Intermittent TBS provides an advance in terms of reduced treatment duration. tDCS is a potential treatment for non-treatment resistant depression. To date, there is not sufficient published data available to draw firm conclusions about the efficacy and acceptability of TBS and sTMS.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

DynaMed is a database of synthesized evidence. We investigated whether primary care clinicians would answer more clinical questions, change clinical decision making, and alter search time using DynaMed in addition to their usual information sources.\nMETHODS: Fifty-two primary care clinicians na\u00efve to DynaMed searched for answers to 698 of their own clinical questions using the Internet. On a per-question basis, participants were randomized to have access to DynaMed (A) or not (N) in addition to their usual information sources. Outcomes included proportions of questions answered, proportions of questions with answers that changed clinical decision making, and median search times. The statistical approach of per-participant analyses of clinicians who asked questions in both A and N states was decided before data collection.\nRESULTS: Among 46 clinicians in per-participant analyses, 23 (50%) answered a greater proportion of questions during A than N, and 13 (28.3%) answered more questions during N than A (P = .05). Finding answers that changed clinical decision making occurred more often during A (25 clinicians, 54.3%) than during N (13 clinicians, 28.3%) (P = .01). Search times did not differ significantly. Overall, participants found answers for 263 (75.8%) of 347 A questions and 250 (71.2%) of 351 N questions. Answers changed clinical decision making for 224 (64.6%) of the A questions and 209 (59.5%) of the N questions.\nCONCLUSIONS: Using DynaMed, primary care clinicians answered more questions and changed clinical decisions more often, without increasing overall search time. Synthesizing results of systematic evidence surveillance is a feasible method for meeting clinical information needs in primary care.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

We therefore compared chemotherapy plus cetuximab with chemotherapy alone in patients with advanced EGFR-positive non-small-cell lung cancer.\nMETHODS: In a multinational, multicentre, open-label, phase III trial, chemotherapy-naive patients (>or=18 years) with advanced EGFR-expressing histologically or cytologically proven stage wet IIIB or stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to chemotherapy plus cetuximab or just chemotherapy. Chemotherapy was cisplatin 80 mg/m(2) intravenous infusion on day 1, and vinorelbine 25 mg/m(2) intravenous infusion on days 1 and 8 of every 3-week cycle) for up to six cycles. Cetuximab-at a starting dose of 400 mg/m(2) intravenous infusion over 2 h on day 1, and from day 8 onwards at 250 mg/m(2) over 1 h per week-was continued after the end of chemotherapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity had occurred. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00148798.\nFINDINGS: Between October, 2004, and January, 2006, 1125 patients were randomly assigned to chemotherapy plus cetuximab (n=557) or chemotherapy alone (n=568). Patients given chemotherapy plus cetuximab survived longer than those in the chemotherapy-alone group (median 11.3 months vs 10.1 months; hazard ratio for death 0.871 [95% CI 0.762-0.996]; p=0.044). The main cetuximab-related adverse event was acne-like rash (57 [10%] of 548, grade 3).\nINTERPRETATION: Addition of cetuximab to platinum-based chemotherapy represents a new treatment option for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.\nFUNDING: Merck KGaA.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

In addition, reference citations from publications identified were reviewed.\nSTUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All identified articles in English were evaluated. Clinical trials, case reports, and meta-analyses describing topical use of tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid to prevent postoperative bleeding were included.\nDATA SYNTHESIS: A total of 16 publications in the setting of major surgical procedures were included; the majority of data were for tranexamic acid. For cardiac surgery, 4 trials used solutions containing tranexamic acid (1-2.5 g in 100-250 mL of 0.9% NaCl), and 1 trial assessed a solution containing aminocaproic acid (24 g in 250 mL of 0.9% NaCl). These solutions were poured into the chest cavity before sternotomy closure. For orthopedic procedures, all of the data were for topical irrigation solutions containing tranexamic acid (500 mg-3 g in 50-100 mL of 0.9% NaCl) or for intraarticular injections of tranexamic acid (250 mg to 2 g in 20-50 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride, with or without carbazochrome sodium sulfate). Overall, use of topical tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid reduced postoperative blood loss; however, few studies reported a significant reduction in the number of packed red blood cell transfusions or units given, intensive care unit stay, or length of hospitalization.\nCONCLUSIONS: Topical application of tranexamic acid and aminocaproic acid to decrease postsurgical bleeding after major surgical procedures is a promising strategy.

Individuals with nocturnal hypercapnia but daytime normocapnia were randomised to a control group or nocturnal NIV to examine whether nocturnal hypoventilation is a valid indication for NIV.\nMETHODS: Forty eight patients with congenital neuromuscular or chest wall disease aged 7-51 years and vital capacity<50% predicted underwent overnight respiratory monitoring. Twenty six with daytime normocapnia and nocturnal hypercapnia were randomised to either nocturnal NIV or to a control group without ventilatory support. NIV was started in the control group if patients fulfilled preset safety criteria.\nRESULTS: Peak nocturnal transcutaneous carbon dioxide tension (Tcco2) did not differ between the groups, but the mean (SD) percentage of the night during which Tcco2 was >6.5 kPa decreased in the NIV group (-57.7 (26.1)%) but not in controls (-11.75 (46.1)%; p=0.049, 95% CI -91.5 to -0.35). Mean (SD) arterial oxygen saturation increased in the NIV group (+2.97 (2.57)%) but not in controls (-1.12 (2.02)%; p=0.024, 95% CI 0.69 to 7.5). Nine of the 10 controls failed non-intervention by fulfilling criteria to initiate NIV after a mean (SD) of 8.3 (7.3) months.\nCONCLUSION: Patients with neuromuscular disease with nocturnal hypoventilation are likely to deteriorate with the development of daytime hypercapnia and/or progressive symptoms within 2 years and may benefit from the introduction of nocturnal NIV before daytime hypercapnia ensues.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Age, weight and height was taken, a detailed history and clinical examination was performed. Blood was drawn for 25 Hydroxy Vitamin D3 (25OHD) level. Two women had >30 ng/mL of 25OHD and was excluded from the study. The participants were divided into two groups of 24 in each arm. All participants equivocally agreed not to change their dietary habits and life style till the study was over. The study group of women were asked to apply; Top-D (Aloe Vera based- Vitamin D3) (Patency Pending) was developed at King Fahd Hospital of the University, AlKhobar with each gram of the Top-D cream delivering 5000 IU of vitamin D3. The second group used 1 gram of Aloe vera gel. The participants had no knowledge to which group they belong. A second blood sample was taken at the end of 3 months and the data was analyzed.\nRESULTS: The data of 48 women was available for analysis. The average age was 22.58 \u00b1 1.95 years. The mean pre-treatment 25OHD in the study group was 12.05 ng/Ml \u00b1 6.54 and post-treatment was 37.95 ng/mL \u00b1 6.43 (P=0.001, CI<28.582 ).

Extended-release depot formulations may improve adherence, but long-term adherence rates to depot naltrexone are not known. This study determined long-term rates of adherence to depot naltrexone and whether employment-based reinforcement can improve adherence.\nDESIGN: Participants who were inducted onto oral naltrexone were assigned randomly to contingency (n = 18) or prescription (n = 17) groups. Participants were offered six depot naltrexone injections and invited to work at the therapeutic workplace on week days for 26 weeks, where they earned stipends for participating in job skills training. Contingency participants were required to accept naltrexone injections to maintain workplace access and to maintain maximum pay. Prescription participants could work independently of whether they accepted injections.\nSETTING: The therapeutic workplace, a model employment-based intervention for drug addiction and unemployment.\nPARTICIPANTS: Opioid-dependent unemployed adults.\nMEASUREMENTS: Depot naltrexone injections accepted and opiate-negative urine samples.\nFINDINGS: Contingency participants accepted significantly more naltrexone injections than prescription participants (81% versus 42%), and were more likely to accept all injections (66% versus 35%). At monthly assessments (with missing urine samples imputed as positive), the groups provided similar percentages of samples negative for opiates (74% versus 62%) and for cocaine (56% versus 54%). Opiate-positive samples were more likely when samples were also positive for cocaine.\nCONCLUSIONS: Employment-based reinforcement can maintain adherence to depot naltrexone. Future research should determine whether persistent cocaine use compromises naltrexone's effect on opiate use. Workplaces may be useful for promoting sustained adherence to depot naltrexone.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

These abnormalities are thought to reflect a deficiency in the synchronization of pyramidal cell activity that is dependent, in part, on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission through GABA type A (GABA(A)) receptors containing alpha(2) subunits. The authors conducted a proof-of-concept clinical trial designed to test the hypothesis that a novel compound with relatively selective agonist activity at GABA(A) receptors containing alpha(2) subunits would improve cognitive function and gamma band oscillations in individuals with schizophrenia.\nMETHOD: Participants were male subjects (N=15) with chronic schizophrenia who were randomly assigned to receive 4 weeks of treatment with the study drug MK-0777, a benzodiazepine-like agent with selective activity at GABA(A) receptors containing alpha(2) or alpha(3) subunits, or a matched placebo in a double-blind fashion. Outcome measures were the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status, three tests of working memory and/or cognitive control (N-back, AX Continuous Performance Test, and Preparing to Overcome Prepotency), and EEG measures of gamma band oscillations induced during the Preparing to Overcome Prepotency task.\nRESULTS: Compared with placebo, the MK-0777 compound was associated with improved performance on the N-back, AX Continuous Performance Test, and Preparing to Overcome Prepotency tasks. The compound was also associated with increased frontal gamma band power during the Preparing to Overcome Prepotency task. No effects of the MK-0777 compound were detected in BPRS or Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status scores, with the exception of improvement on the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status delayed memory index. The MK-0777 agent was well-tolerated.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings provide preliminary support for the hypothesis that enhanced GABA activity at alpha(2) subunit containing GABA(A) receptors improves behavioral and electrophysiological measures of prefrontal function in individuals with schizophrenia.\n## Response:\nFALSE"}

DOT-ART patients and supporters received baseline and follow-up training and monitoring. The primary endpoints were the proportions of patients with HIV viral load less than 400 copies/ml and change in CD4 cell counts at 12 and 24 months.\nRESULTS: Two hundred and seventy-four patients enrolled (137 in each arm) and baseline characteristics were similar for both arms. The study was stopped early for futility by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board. In an intention-to-treat analysis, the proportions of patients with viral load less than 400 copies/ml at 12 months were 72.8% in the DOT-ART arm and 68.4% in the Self-ART arm (P = 0.42). DOT-ART patients had greater median CD4 cell count (cells/microl) increases at 6 months [148 (IQR 84-222) vs. 111 (IQR 44-196) P = 0.02] but similar results at all other time-points. Survival was significantly better in the DOT-ART arm (9 deaths, 6.6%) than in the Self-ART arm (20 deaths, 14.6%; log-rank P = 0.02). In Cox regression analysis, mortality was independently associated with study arm [DOT vs. self-ART; HR 0.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17-0.86].\nCONCLUSION: DOT-ART showed no effect on virologic outcomes but was associated with greater CD4 cell count increases at 6-month follow-up. Survival was significantly better for DOT-ART compared to Self-ART, but this was not explained by improved virologic or immunologic outcomes.\n## Response:\nFALSE"}

This study examined effects on outcomes, service costs, and user satisfaction among adults with serious mental illness.\nMETHODS: Public mental health system clients were randomly assigned to self-directed care (N=114) versus services as usual (N=102) and assessed at baseline and 12 and 24 months. The primary outcome was self-perceived recovery. Secondary outcomes included psychosocial status, psychiatric symptom severity, and behavioral rehabilitation indicators. Mixed-effects random-regression analysis tested for longitudinal changes in outcomes between the two conditions. Differences in service costs were analyzed with negative binomial and zero-inflated negative binomial regression models.\nRESULTS: Compared with the control group, self-directed care participants had significantly greater improvement over time in recovery, self-esteem, coping mastery, autonomy support, somatic symptoms, employment, and education. No between-group differences were found in total per-person service costs in years 1 and 2 or both years combined. However, self-directed care participants were more likely than control group participants to have zero costs for six of 12 individual services and to have lower costs for four. The most frequent nontraditional purchases were for transportation (21%), communication (17%), medical care (15%), residential (14%), and health and wellness needs (11%). Client satisfaction with mental health services was significantly higher among intervention participants, compared with control participants, at both follow-ups.\nCONCLUSIONS: The budget-neutral self-directed care model achieved superior client outcomes and greater satisfaction with mental health care, compared with services as usual.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

Approved therapies do not halt disease progression.\nOBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of recombinant human pentraxin 2 vs placebo on change from baseline to week 28 in mean forced vital capacity (FVC) percentage of predicted value.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 18 sites in 7 countries of eligible patients with IPF (N\u2009=\u2009117; aged 40-80 years; FVC \u226550% and \u226490% predicted; ratio of forced expiratory volume in the first second/FVC >0.70; diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide [Dlco] \u226525% and \u226490% predicted; and distance of \u2265150 m on the 6-minute walk test). Study period was August 2015-May 2017.\nINTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to receive either recombinant human pentraxin 2 (10 mg/kg intravenous every 4 weeks, n\u2009=\u200977) or placebo (n\u2009=\u200939) for 24 weeks, and stratified by concurrent IPF treatment status.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was the least-squares mean change in FVC percentage of predicted value from baseline to week 28 (minimal clinically important difference, decline of 2%-6%). Secondary end points included mean change in lung volumes (total, normal, and interstitial lung abnormalities) on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and 6-minute walk distance (minimal clinically important difference, 24-45 m).\nRESULTS: Of 117 randomized patients, 116 received at least 1 dose of study drug (mean age, 68.6 years; 81.0% men; mean time since IPF diagnosis, 3.8 years), and 111 (95.7%) completed the study. The least-squares mean change in FVC percentage of predicted value from baseline to week 28 in patients treated with recombinant human pentraxin 2 was -2.5 vs -4.8 for those in the placebo group (difference, +2.3 [90% CI, 1.1 to 3.5]; P\u2009=\u2009.001). No significant treatment differences were observed in total lung volume (difference, 93.5 mL [90% CI, -27.7 to 214.7]), quantitative parenchymal features on HRCT (normal lung volume difference, -1.2% [90% CI, -4.4 to 1.9]; interstitial lung abnormalities difference, 1.1% [90% CI, -2.2 to 4.3]), or measurement of Dlco (difference, -0.4 [90% CI, -2.6 to 1.7]). The change in 6-minute walk distance was -0.5 m for patients treated with recombinant human pentraxin 2 vs -31.8 m for those in the placebo group (difference, +31.3 m [90% CI, 17.4 to 45.1]; P < .001). The most common adverse events in the recombinant human pentraxin 2 vs placebo group were cough (18% vs 5%), fatigue (17% vs 10%), and nasopharyngitis (16% vs 23%).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this preliminary study, recombinant human pentraxin 2 vs placebo resulted in a slower decline in lung function over 28 weeks for patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

The novel oral anticoagulation agents include direct Factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban and apixaban, and the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran. In elective surgery, discontinuing their use is important, but renal function must also be considered because elimination is highly dependent on renal elimination. If bleeding occurs in patients who have received these agents, common principles of bleeding management as with any anticoagulant (including the known principles for warfarin) should be considered. This review summarizes the available data regarding the management of bleeding with novel oral anticoagulation agents. Hemodialysis is a therapeutic option for dabigatran-related bleeding, while in vitro studies showed that prothrombin complex concentrates are reported to be useful for rivaroxaban-related bleeding. Additional clinical studies are needed to determine the best method for reversal of the novel oral anticoagulation agents when bleeding occurs.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Because of safety findings from the Evaluation of Sorafenib, Carboplatin and Paclitaxel Efficacy in NSCLC (ESCAPE) trial, patients with squamous cell histology were withdrawn from the trial in February 2008 and excluded from analysis. The primary end point was overall survival (OS), and secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS) and time-to-progression (TTP).\nRESULTS: The primary analysis population consisted of 772 patients (sorafenib, 385; placebo, 387); the two groups had similar demographic and baseline characteristics. Median OS was similar in the sorafenib and placebo groups (12.4 v 12.5 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.98; P = .401). By investigator assessment, sorafenib improved median PFS (6.0 v 5.5 months; HR, 0.83; P = .008) and TTP (6.1 v 5.5 months; HR, 0.73; P < .001).

Insomnia is prevalent, is associated with a number of negative sequelae, and can be effectively managed with cognitive behavioral treatment of insomnia (CBT-I). Telehealth technologies can provide a means for increasing access to CBT-I.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: The Tele-Insomnia program is a Veterans Health Administration (VHA) initiative in which CBT-I is delivered in a group format by telehealth. Veterans received six weekly sessions of group CBT-I, completing the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and daily sleep diaries throughout treatment. Paired-samples t-tests were used to examine differences in each measure from the first to the last session of treatment.\nRESULTS: There were statistically and clinically significant improvements in the ISI and all sleep diary variables with the exception of total sleep time. Video quality was excellent, and there were few connectivity problems.\nCONCLUSIONS: Clinical video telehealth technology can be used to deliver group CBT-I in a manner that produces clinically significant improvement. This model is scalable and has been used to develop a national clinical telehealth program.\n## Response:\nFALSE"}

Recent studies are providing clues as to the specific signalling roles of co-stimulatory receptors. Furthermore, superimposition of inhibitory signals, such as those delivered by cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), leads to a complex network of positive and negative co-stimulatory signals, the integration of which modulates immune responses.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

In one study, subjects received losartan 50 mg (L50) plus H12.5 during an 8-week filter period. They were then randomized to either L100/H12.5 or L50/H12.5 for another 8 weeks, followed by L100/H12.5 for 44 weeks. The primary end point was safety of L100/H12.5 for 52 weeks. In the second study, subjects received L100 during an 8-week filter period. Subjects were then randomized to receive either L100/H12.5 or L100 for a further 8 weeks. The primary end point was change from baseline in sitting diastolic blood pressure (SiDBP) at week 8. Safety was assessed throughout both studies. L100/H12.5 reduced SiDBP and sitting systolic blood pressure (SiSBP) at 8 weeks, and when compared with L100, the differences were statistically significant for both measures (P<0.001). L100/H12.5 reductions SiDBP for 8 weeks were comparable to L50/H12.5. The efficacy of L100/H12.5 was maintained to week 52. Drug-related adverse events with an incidence \u2a7e 2% in the L100/H12.5 group during the 52-week extension period were an increase in aspartate aminotransferase and in blood uric acid. Additionally, mean uric acid levels were reduced by 0.57 mg dl(-1) from baseline with long-term treatment with L100/H12.5 in subjects whose baseline uric acid level was >7.0 mg dl(-1). In conclusion, L100/H12.5 was shown to be more effective than L100 at reducing SiDBP and SiSBP and showed good tolerability in Japanese patients with essential hypertension.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

The source and function of CTpr production in sepsis, however, remains an enigma. In the classical view, the transcription of the CT-I gene is restricted to neuroendocrine cells, in particular the C cells of the thyroid. To better understand the pathophysiology of CTpr induction in sepsis, we used an animal model analog to human sepsis, in which bacterial infection is induced in hamsters by implanting Escherichia coli pellets ip. Compared with control hamsters, levels of CTpr were elevated several fold in septic plasma and in nearly all septic hamster tissues analyzed. Unexpectedly, CT-messenger RNA was ubiquitously and uniformly expressed in multiple tissues throughout the body in response to sepsis. Notably, the transcriptional expression of CT-messenger RNA seemed more widely up-regulated in sepsis than were classical cytokines (e.g. tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6). Our findings, which describe a potentially new mechanism of host response to a microbial infection mediated by CTpr, introduce a new pathophysiological role for the CT-I gene.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

The main outcome measures were lipopolysaccharide-stimulated production of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), and scores on the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF), the vitality scale from the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form (SF-36), and the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale.\nRESULTS: Immediately post-treatment, fatigue was not lower (P > .05) but vitality was higher (P = .01) in the yoga group compared with the control group. At 3 months post-treatment, fatigue was lower in the yoga group (P = .002), vitality was higher (P = .01), and IL-6 (P = .027), TNF-\u03b1 (P = .027), and IL-1\u03b2 (P = .037) were lower for yoga participants compared with the control group. Groups did not differ on depression at either time (P > .2). Planned secondary analyses showed that the frequency of yoga practice had stronger associations with fatigue at both post-treatment visits (P = .019; P < .001), as well as vitality (P = .016; P = .0045), but not depression (P > .05) than simple group assignment; more frequent practice produced larger changes. At 3 months post-treatment, increasing yoga practice also led to a decrease in IL-6 (P = .01) and IL-1\u03b2 (P = .03) production but not in TNF-\u03b1 production (P > .05).\nCONCLUSION: Chronic inflammation may fuel declines in physical function leading to frailty and disability. If yoga dampens or limits both fatigue and inflammation, then regular practice could have substantial health benefits.\n## Response:\nFALSE"}

We tested the effects of cognitive rehabilitation in these patients using the Attention Process Training-II (APT-II) program in a single-blinded, randomized clinical trial.\nMETHODS: Patients were randomized to APT-II or standard care and evaluated at baseline, 6, and 12 months with functional, quality of life, cognitive tests, and resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI).\nRESULTS: Forty-six patients were enrolled and 43 (mean\u00b1SD age 75.1\u00b16.8) completed the study. No change was seen in functionality and quality of life between treated and non-treated patients. However, the Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test immediate recall showed a significant improvement in treated compared to non-treated group (change score 6 versus 12 months: 1.8\u00b14.9 and -1.4\u00b13.8, p\u200a=\u200a0.021; baseline versus 12 months: 3.8\u00b16.1 and 0.2\u00b14.4, p\u200a=\u200a0.032).

Time point of measurement: 20 min after the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).\nAbstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Despite advances in cardiac arrest resuscitation, neurologic impairments and other organ dysfunctions cause considerable mortality and morbidity after restoration of spontaneous cardiac activity. The mechanisms underlying this postresuscitation disease probably involve a whole-body ischemia and reperfusion syndrome that triggers a systemic inflammatory response.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Postresuscitation disease is characterized by high levels of circulating cytokines and adhesion molecules, the presence of plasma endotoxin, and dysregulated leukocyte production of cytokines: a profile similar to that seen in severe sepsis. Transient myocardial dysfunction can occur after resuscitation, mainly as a result of myocardial stunning. However, early successful angioplasty is independently associated with better outcomes after cardiac arrest associated with myocardial infarction. Coagulation abnormalities occur consistently after successful resuscitation, and their severity is associated with mortality. For example, plasma protein C and S activities after successful resuscitation are lower in nonsurvivors than in survivors. Low baseline cortisol levels may be associated with an increased risk of fatal early refractory shock after cardiac arrest, suggesting adrenal dysfunction in these patients.\nSUMMARY: Postresuscitation abnormalities after cardiac arrest mimic the immunologic and coagulation disorders observed in severe sepsis. This suggests that therapeutic approaches used recently with success in severe sepsis should be investigated in patients successfully resuscitated after cardiac arrest.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

This year we will organize our discussion to review recent reports related to the origins and persistence of asthma in both adults and children. We highlight Journal publications from 2004, along with recent key publications from other medical journals, to provide a perspective on the rapidly developing areas of genetics, including pharmacogenetics, respiratory infection, biomarker measurements, and asthma pharmacotherapy. This new understanding of the pathogenesis of asthma combined with clinical applications of genetics and biomarkers should lead to new management strategies. Asthma management is likely to change in the coming years from a strategy directed to the best outcome in groups of patients to an individualized approach to assessment and management.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Drawing on social learning and elaboration likelihood models, we designed and tested two positive-focused presentations by high school peer leaders delivered in the context of a suicide prevention program (Sources of Strength). Thirty-six classrooms in four schools (N\u00a0=\u00a0706 students) were randomized to (1) peer leader modeling of healthy coping, (2) peer leader modeling plus audience involvement to identify trusted adults, or (3) control condition. Students' attitudes and norms were assessed by immediate post-only assessments. Exposure to either presentation enhanced positive coping attitudes and perceptions of adult support. Students who reported suicide ideation in the past 12\u00a0months benefited more than nonsuicidal students. Beyond modeling alone, audience involvement modestly enhanced expectations of adult support, congruent with the elaboration likelihood model. Positive peer modeling is a promising alternative to communications focused on negative consequences and directives and may enhance social-interpersonal factors linked to reduced suicidal behaviors.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

RAAS parameters were evaluated in response to each diet and a graded angiotensin II infusion. Further analyses were performed after groups were substratified by median VAT measured by magnetic resonance imaging.\nRESULTS: Aldosterone concentrations during the low-sodium diet were higher in HIV than non-HIV-infected subjects [13.8 (9.7, 30.9) vs 9.2 (7.6, 13.6) ng/dL, P = .03] and increased across groups stratified by visceral adipose tissue (VAT) [8.5 (7.1, 12.8), 9.2 (8.1, 21.5), 11.4 (9.4, 13.8), and 27.2 (13.0, 36.9) ng/dL in non-HIV-infected without increased VAT, non-HIV-infected with increased VAT, HIV-infected without increased VAT, HIV-infected with increased VAT, respectively, overall trend P = .02]. Under this condition, plasma renin activity [3.50 (2.58, 4.65) vs 1.45 (0.58, 2.33) ng/mL \u00b7 h, P = .002] was higher among the HIV-infected subjects with vs without increased VAT. Differences in the suppressibility of plasma renin activity by graded angiotensin infusion were seen stratifying by VAT among the HIV-infected group (P < .02 at each dose). In addition, aldosterone (P = .007) was an independent predictor of insulin resistance in multivariate modeling, controlling for VAT and adiponectin.\nCONCLUSION: These data suggest excess RAAS activation in relationship to visceral adiposity in HIV-infected patients that may independently contribute to insulin resistance. Mineralocorticoid blockade may have therapeutic potential to reduce metabolic complications in HIV-infected patients with increased visceral adiposity.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

There are no effective therapies. In an open-label study of three patients with this syndrome, antisense-mediated inhibition of hepatic \nMETHODS: We conducted a phase 3, double-blind, randomized 52-week trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of volanesorsen in 66 patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome. Patients were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive volanesorsen or placebo. The primary end point was the percentage change in fasting triglyceride levels from baseline to 3 months.\nRESULTS: Patients receiving volanesorsen had a decrease in mean plasma apolipoprotein C-III levels from baseline of 25.7 mg per deciliter, corresponding to an 84% decrease at 3 months, whereas patients receiving placebo had an increase in mean plasma apolipoprotein C-III levels from baseline of 1.9 mg per deciliter, corresponding to a 6.1% increase (P<0.001). Patients receiving volanesorsen had a 77% decrease in mean triglyceride levels, corresponding to a mean decrease of 1712 mg per deciliter (19.3 mmol per liter) (95% confidence interval [CI], 1330 to 2094 mg per deciliter [15.0 to 23.6 mmol per liter]), whereas patients receiving placebo had an 18% increase in mean triglyceride levels, corresponding to an increase of 92.0 mg per deciliter (1.0 mmol per liter) (95% CI, -301.0 to 486 mg per deciliter [-3.4 to 5.5 mmol per liter]) (P<0.001). At 3 months, 77% of the patients in the volanesorsen group, as compared with 10% of patients in the placebo group, had triglyceride levels of less than 750 mg per deciliter (8.5 mmol per liter). A total of 20 of 33 patients who received volanesorsen had injection-site reactions, whereas none of the patients who received placebo had such reactions. No patients in the placebo group had platelet counts below 100,000 per microliter, whereas 15 of 33 patients in the volanesorsen group had such levels, including 2 who had levels below 25,000 per microliter. No patient had platelet counts below 50,000 per microliter after enhanced platelet-monitoring began.\nCONCLUSIONS: Volanesorsen lowered triglyceride levels to less than 750 mg per deciliter in 77% of patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome. Thrombocytopenia and injection-site reactions were common adverse events.

First, we seek to make theorists and researchers aware of the importance of not using the terms moderator and mediator interchangeably by carefully elaborating, both conceptually and strategically, the many ways in which moderators and mediators differ. We then go beyond this largely pedagogical function and delineate the conceptual and strategic implications of making use of such distinctions with regard to a wide range of phenomena, including control and stress, attitudes, and personality traits. We also provide a specific compendium of analytic procedures appropriate for making the most effective use of the moderator and mediator distinction, both separately and in terms of a broader causal system that includes both moderators and mediators.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

The steroidal inhibitor exemestane is partially non-cross-resistant with nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors and is a mild androgen and could prove superior to anastrozole regarding efficacy and toxicity, specifically with less bone loss.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: We designed an open-label, randomized, phase III trial of 5 years of exemestane versus anastrozole with a two-sided test of superiority to detect a 2.4% improvement with exemestane in 5-year event-free survival (EFS). Secondary objectives included assessment of overall survival, distant disease-free survival, incidence of contralateral new primary breast cancer, and safety.\nRESULTS: In the study, 7,576 women (median age, 64.1 years) were enrolled. At median follow-up of 4.1 years, 4-year EFS was 91% for exemestane and 91.2% for anastrozole (stratified hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.18; P = .85). Overall, distant disease-free survival and disease-specific survival were also similar. In all, 31.6% of patients discontinued treatment as a result of adverse effects, concomitant disease, or study refusal. Osteoporosis/osteopenia, hypertriglyceridemia, vaginal bleeding, and hypercholesterolemia were less frequent on exemestane, whereas mild liver function abnormalities and rare episodes of atrial fibrillation were less frequent on anastrozole. Vasomotor and musculoskeletal symptoms were similar between arms.\nCONCLUSION: This first comparison of steroidal and nonsteroidal classes of aromatase inhibitors showed neither to be superior in terms of breast cancer outcomes as 5-year initial adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal breast cancer by two-way test. Less toxicity on bone is compatible with one hypothesis behind MA.27 but requires confirmation. Exemestane should be considered another option as up-front adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.\n## Response:\nFALSE"}

Each patient participated in two 40-h outpatient sessions, CLC versus OL, in randomized order. Sensor (Dexcom G4) and insulin pump (Tandem t:slim) were connected to Diabetes Assistant (DiAs)-a smartphone artificial pancreas platform. The patient operated the system through the DiAs user interface during both CLC and OL; study personnel supervised on site and monitored DiAs remotely. There were no dietary restrictions; 45-min walks in town and restaurant dinners were included in both CLC and OL; alcohol was permitted.\nRESULTS: The primary outcome-reduction in risk for hypoglycemia as measured by the low blood glucose (BG) index (LGBI)-resulted in an effect size of 0.64, P = 0.003, with a twofold reduction of hypoglycemia requiring carbohydrate treatment: 1.2 vs. 2.4 episodes/session on CLC versus OL (P = 0.02). This was accompanied by a slight decrease in percentage of time in the target range of 3.9-10 mmol/L (66.1 vs. 70.7%) and increase in mean BG (8.9 vs. 8.4 mmol/L; P = 0.04) on CLC versus OL.\nCONCLUSIONS: CLC running on a smartphone (DiAs) in outpatient conditions reduced hypoglycemia and hypoglycemia treatments when compared with sensor-augmented pump therapy. This was accompanied by marginal increase in average glycemia resulting from a possible overemphasis on hypoglycemia safety.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

In contrast, the 1:2.5 group showed progressive hypotension and metabolic acidemia (pH 6.92 +/- 0.1 after the final occlusion). There was a marked increase in ST waveform height during occlusions; this increase was greater in the 1:2.5 group (P <.001), but there was overlap between the groups. ST waveform height between occlusions was significantly higher in the 1:2.5 group (P <.001) until negative and biphasic ST waveforms developed in these fetuses between occlusions in the final 30 minutes.\nCONCLUSION: ST waveform elevation occurs during umbilical cord occlusions but only crudely reflects the severity of hypoxia. Interocclusion waveform height may be a better reflection of the severity of hypoxia. The appearance of biphasic and negative waveforms between occlusions may be a useful marker for severe decompensation.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Participants were randomly allocated to the control group (standard treatment with rivaroxaban for six months and ECS for 12 months) or the experimental group (standard treatment with the additional use of diosmin 600 mg once daily for 12 months). Patients were followed for 12 months. The primary outcome was post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS), according to the Villalta Score (\u22655). The secondary outcomes were deep vein recanalization, chronic venous disease (CVD) progression, the severity of PTS (Villalta), and CVD (VCSS), quality of life (CIVIQ-20), venous thromboembolism recurrence, and adverse event (AE).\nRESULTS: Ninety patients were randomized (45 per group). There were 56 men and 34 women with a mean age of 57.8\u00b113.4 years, and 69% had clinically unprovoked DVT. PTS frequency at 12 months was significantly lower (8.9% vs. 48.9%) in the experimental group compared with control one (relative risk, 0.14; 95% confidential interval, 0.04-0.43, P<0.001). Adding diosmin 600 was associated with quicker and complete vein recanalization, lower CVD progression rate, and lower Villalta, VCSS, and CIVIQ-20 scores. There was no difference in recurrent DVT or AE.\nCONCLUSIONS: Adjunctive use of diosmin 600 to rivaroxaban and ECS in patients with femoropopliteal DVT can improve the clinical and ultrasound outcomes after 12 months of treatment.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

To determine which time frame is most accurate, we compared 3-, 7-day, and 1-month self-reports with data from medication event monitoring system (MEMS). To determine which response task is most accurate we compared three different 1-month self-report tasks (frequency, percent, and rating) to MEMS. We analyzed 643 study visits made by 156 participants. Over-reporting (self-report minus MEMS) was significantly less for the 1-month recall period (9%) than for the 3 (17%) or 7-day (14%) periods. Over-reporting was significantly less for the 1-month rating task (3%) than for the 1-month frequency and percent tasks (both 12%). We conclude that 1-month recall periods may be more accurate than 3- or 7-day periods, and that items that ask respondents to rate their adherence may be more accurate than those that ask about frequencies or percents.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

In this study, the efficacy of amiodarone for prevention of post-pulmonary resection AF was investigated.\nMETHODS: One hundred thirty patients undergoing lobectomy, bilobectomy, or pneumonectomy were randomly assigned prospectively to receive amiodarone (n = 65) or no prophylaxis (control group, n = 65). The amiodarone group received 1,050 mg by continuous intravenous infusion over 24 hours, initiated at the time of anesthesia induction, followed by 400 mg orally twice daily until hospital discharge or for a maximum of 6 days. The primary endpoint was AF requiring treatment during hospitalization. Secondary endpoints included postoperative length of hospital and intensive care unit stays.\nRESULTS: There were no significant differences between the amiodarone and control groups in demographics, comorbid conditions, extent of pulmonary resection, or preoperative or postoperative use of beta-blockers or calcium-channel blockers. The incidence of AF was lower in the amiodarone group than in the control group (13.8% versus 32.3%, p = 0.02; relative risk reduction = 57%). There was no difference between the amiodarone and control groups in median length of hospital stay (7 versus 8 days, p = 0.79), but median length of intensive care unit stay was shorter in the amiodarone group (46 versus 84 hours, p = 0.03). There was no significant difference between the amiodarone and control groups in the incidence of pulmonary complications or other adverse effects.\nCONCLUSIONS: Amiodarone prophylaxis significantly reduces the incidence of AF after anatomic pulmonary resection, and is associated with a significant reduction in length of intensive care unit stay.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

Preliminary results have supported the use of DCS to augment exposure therapy in adult anxiety disorders; however, no data have been reported in any childhood anxiety disorder. Thus, we sought to preliminarily examine whether weight-adjusted DCS doses (25 or 50 mg) enhanced the overall efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).\nMETHOD: Participants were 30 youth (aged 8-17) with a primary diagnosis of OCD. The study design was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled augmentation trial examining CBT + DCS versus CBT + Placebo (15 youth per group). All patients received seven exposure and response prevention sessions paired with DCS or placebo taken 1 hour before sessions.\nRESULTS: Although not significantly different, compared with the CBT + Placebo group, youth in the CBT + DCS arm showed small-to-moderate treatment effects (d = .31-.47 on primary outcomes). No adverse events were recorded.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results complement findings in adult OCD and non-OCD anxiety disorders and provide initial support for a more extensive study of DCS augmentation of CBT among youth with OCD.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

We explored gender role strain (GRS) arising from conflict between homosexuality and cultural conceptions of masculinity among young Black men who have sex with men (MSM). Methods. We conducted a categorical analysis (a qualitative, 3-stage, iterative analysis) of data from studies conducted in 2001 to 2006, which interviewed 35 men aged 18 to 24 years in 3 New York cities and Atlanta, Georgia. Results. Participants described rigid, often antihomosexual expectations of masculinity from their families, peers, and communities. Consistent with GRS, this conflict and pressure to conform to these expectations despite their homosexuality led to psychological distress, efforts to camouflage their homosexuality, and strategies to prove their masculinity. Participants believed this conflict and the associated experience of GRS might increase HIV risk through social isolation, poor self-esteem, reduced access to HIV prevention messages, and limited parental-family involvement in sexuality development and early sexual decision-making. Conclusions. Antihomosexual expectations of masculinity isolate young Black MSM during a developmental stage when interpersonal attachments are critical. GRS may influence sexual risk behavior and HIV risk and be an important target for HIV prevention.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

In the core studies, 949 people were randomized to asenapine (n = 241 and 244) or olanzapine (n = 240 and 224); 26-week completion rates with asenapine were 64.7% and 49.6% (olanzapine, 80.4% and 63.8%) in the EH and WH, respectively. In the EH and WH extensions, respectively (asenapine, n = 134 and 86; olanzapine, n = 172 and 110), 52-week completion rates were 84.3% and 66.3% with asenapine (olanzapine, 89.0% and 80.9%). Asenapine was not superior to olanzapine in change in the 16-item Negative Symptom Assessment Scale total score in either core study, but asenapine was superior to olanzapine at week 52 in the WH extension study. Olanzapine was associated with modest, but significantly greater, changes in PANSS positive subscale score at various assessment times in both core studies and the WH extension study. Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was comparable between treatments across studies. Weight gain was consistently lower with asenapine. Extrapyramidal symptom-related adverse event incidence was higher with asenapine (EH: 8.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.1%-12.5%; WH: 16.4%; 95% CI, 11.9%-21.6%) than olanzapine (EH: 3.3%; 95% CI, 1.4%-6.4%; WH: 12.1%; 95% CI, 8.1%-17.0%), but Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale-Abbreviated total score changes did not significantly differ between treatments. In conclusion, asenapine superiority over olanzapine was not observed in the core studies. Both treatments improved persistent negative symptoms, but discontinuation rates were higher with asenapine.\n## Response:\nFALSE"}

Acetylcholine has been demonstrated to mediate pruritus in atopic dermatitis. This open pilot study was done to determine the therapeutic effect of blocking acetylcholine release with botulinum toxin A in highly pruritic lichen simplex. Botulinum toxin A (Dysport) was injected intradermally into 5 circumscribed lichenoid lesions in 3 patients suffering from recalcitrant pruritus. No corticosteroids or any other specific topical therapy was administered. Pruritus subsided within 3 to 7 days in all 3 patients. Within 2 to 4 weeks all lesions cleared completely. No recurrences were noted over a 4-month follow-up. In one patient lichen simplex developed on the contralateral shin, which responded equally to a subsequent injection. We concluded that lichen simplex-associated pruritus can be overcome by intradermal botulinum toxin A injection. Acetylcholine appears to be a dominant pruritic mediator in this condition.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Measures of active and passive suicidal ideation were constructed from the Beck Suicide Scale and Beck Depression Inventory obtained at baseline and 3-months follow-up. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of passive and active suicidal ideation while adjusting for demographic characteristics and somatic-affective symptoms of depression (e.g., anhedonia, insomnia).\nRESULTS: Burdensomeness and hopelessness were significantly associated with passive suicidal ideation at baseline and 3 months follow-up, but belongingness and the interaction between belongingness and burdensomeness were not significant predictors as proposed by the interpersonal theory of suicide. Somatic-affective depressive symptoms, but not any of the main effects predicted by the interpersonal theory of suicide or their interactions, were associated with active suicidal ideation at baseline. No factors were consistently associated with active suicidal ideation at 3 months follow-up.\nLIMITATIONS: The measure of burdensomeness used in this study only partially represents the construct described by the interpersonal theory of suicide.\nCONCLUSION: We found little support for the predictions of the interpersonal theory of suicide. Hopelessness appears to be an important determinant of passive suicidal ideation, while somatic-affective depression symptoms may be a key contributor to active suicidal ideation.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

An expected average of 10 minutes after the technique..\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE: To determine whether ultrasound imaging can reduce the risk of failed lumbar punctures or epidural catheterisations, when compared with standard palpation methods, and whether ultrasound imaging can reduce traumatic procedures, insertion attempts, and needle redirections.\nDESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.\nDATA SOURCES: Ovid Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to May 2012, without restriction by language or publication status.\nREVIEW METHODS: Randomised trials that compared ultrasound imaging with standard methods (no imaging) in the performance of a lumbar puncture or epidural catheterisation were identified.\nRESULTS: 14 studies with a total of 1334 patients were included (674 patients assigned to the ultrasound group, 660 to the control group). Five studies evaluated lumbar punctures and nine evaluated epidural catheterisations. Six of 624 procedures conducted in the ultrasound group failed; 44 of 610 procedures in the control group failed. Ultrasound imaging reduced the risk of failed procedures (risk ratio 0.21 (95% confidence interval 0.10 to 0.43), P<0.001). Risk reduction was similar when subgroup analysis was performed for lumbar punctures (risk ratio 0.19 (0.07 to 0.56), P=0.002) or epidural catheterisations (0.23 (0.09 to 0.60), P=0.003). Ultrasound imaging also significantly reduced the risk of traumatic procedures (risk ratio 0.27 (0.11 to 0.67), P=0.005), the number of insertion attempts (mean difference -0.44 (-0.64 to -0.24), P<0.001), and the number of needle redirections (mean difference -1.00 (-1.24 to -0.75), P<0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound imaging can reduce the risk of failed or traumatic lumbar punctures and epidural catheterisations, as well as the number of needle insertions and redirections. Ultrasound may be a useful adjunct for these procedures.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

This study was proposed to quantify the magnitude of the problem.\nMETHODS: Fifteen patients undergoing gastric bypass had oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) recorded continuously, but not displayed, for 24h postoperatively; eight also had arterial blood analysis every 4h. All received narcotic PCA. SpO(2)<90% lasting more than 10 s was reviewed. Results are mean+/-SEM.\nRESULTS: Mean age was 44+/-4 y, and mean BMI was 48+/-2kg/m(2); 77% had OSA. Every patient had more than one episode with SpO(2)<90% for longer than 30s undetected by routine monitoring; most had multiple episodes. Nadir SpO(2) averaged 75% +/- 8%. Mean longest duration of desaturation below 90% averaged 21+/-15min. Mean PaCO(2) was 37+/-3mm Hg; maximum PaCO(2) was 47mm Hg.\nCONCLUSIONS: Severe and prolonged episodes of hypoxemia were a consistent finding, despite aggressive preoperative diagnosis and treatment of OSA, including use of CPAP postoperatively. Although some postoperative hypoventilation was expected, the degree and frequency of desaturation were surprising. No patient exhibited arterial PaCO(2) evidence of hypoventilation. No patient experienced cardiopulmonary arrest/instability, in spite of severe, repeated episodes of hypoxemia. In no instance was a significant hypoxemic episode suspected or detected. Continuous pulse oximetry monitoring, with an audible alarm set for a saturation less than 90% for 10 s, would have alerted providers to 100% of significant hypoxemic episodes. Our recommendation is routinely monitoring (with alarm capability enabled) every bariatric surgical patient, to prevent such occurrence.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Week 12\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Because of the progressive nature of the disease, most patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus eventually require multiple treatments to achieve glycaemic targets. The majority of available therapies are insulin dependent, aiming to decrease insulin resistance and increase insulin secretion. Sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, a new class of antidiabetic agents, limit renal glucose reabsorption promoting urinary excretion of glucose, thereby reducing plasma glucose.\nOBJECTIVE: This article explores the mechanism of action and clinical data surrounding SGLT2 inhibitors, with a particular focus on dapagli-flozin.\nCONCLUSION: Clinical trials have shown dapagliflozin to be effective in reducing glycosylated haemoglobin, weight and fasting plasma glucose, either as monotherapy or as add-on therapy to metformin, sulphonylurea and insulin. Other SGLT2 inhibitors are currently under investigation.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Baseline and 29 days\nAbstract: This phase II, randomised, double-blind, multicentre study (NCT00930982) investigated the safety and efficacy of ciprofloxacin dry powder for inhalation (DPI) in patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. Adults who were culture positive for pre-defined potential respiratory pathogens (including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae) were randomised to ciprofloxacin DPI 32.5 mg or placebo administered twice daily for 28 days (with 56 days of follow-up). Bacterial density in sputum (primary end-point), pulmonary function tests, health-related quality of life and safety were monitored throughout the study. 60 subjects received ciprofloxacin DPI 32.5 mg and 64 received placebo. Subjects on ciprofloxacin DPI had a significant reduction (p<0.001) in total sputum bacterial load at the end of treatment (-3.62 log10 CFU\u00b7g(-1) (range -9.78-5.02 log10 CFU\u00b7g(-1))) compared with placebo (-0.27 log10 CFU\u00b7g(-1) (range -7.96-5.25 log10 CFU\u00b7g(-1))); the counts increased thereafter. In the ciprofloxacin DPI group, 14 (35%) out of 40 subjects reported pathogen eradication at end of treatment versus four (8%) out of 49 in the placebo group (p=0.001). No abnormal safety results were reported and rates of bronchospasm were low. Ciprofloxacin DPI 32.5 mg twice daily for 28 days was well tolerated and achieved significant reductions in total bacterial load compared with placebo in subjects with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

The patients were taking antibiotics prescribed by general practitioners to treat diabetic foot infections. Bone samples were taken from every patient for microbiology analysis in a specialized diabetic foot unit.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The sensitivity of the bone cultures to antibiotics was compared with the patient's previous antibiotic therapy, and antibiotic and bacterial resistance were analyzed.\nMAIN RESULTS: The bone cultures from only 16 patients (22.3%) showed sensitivity to the antibiotics that the patient had been prescribed. Fifty-six patients (77.8%) displayed bacterial resistance to the antibiotic that they were taking.\nCONCLUSIONS: Awareness and implementation of international antibiotic stewardship guidelines are poor in primary care centers.

The primary outcome was the change from baseline to cycle 6 for all indices.\nRESULTS: All parameters were similar at baseline between the two groups. Over six cycles, NOMAC/E2 had less effect on most haemostatic indices than LNG/EE. Lipids were essentially unchanged with NOMAC/E2, whereas with LNG/EE high-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides slightly increased. NOMAC/E2 induced negligible changes in glucose and insulin parameters, in contrast to LNG/EE. A much smaller increase in CRP was observed with NOMAC/E2 than with LNG/EE. NOMAC/E2 was associated with a greater increase in SHBG.\nCONCLUSIONS: The monophasic COC NOMAC/E2 had less influence on haemostasis, lipids and carbohydrate metabolism than the COC LNG/EE.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

We did this phase 3 trial to examine the safety and efficacy of such treatment in children.\nMETHODS: In this final analysis of a phase 3, randomised, multicentre, double-blind study, patients aged 6 months to 17 years with a documented malignancy who were scheduled to receive either moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy were randomly assigned with an interactive voice response system to an age-based and weight-based blinded regimen of aprepitant (125 mg for ages 12-17 years; 3\u00b70 mg/kg up to 125 mg for ages 6 months to <12 years) plus ondansetron on day 1, followed by aprepitant (80 mg for ages 12-17 years; 2\u00b70 mg/kg up to 80 mg for ages 6 months to <12 years) on days 2 and 3, or placebo plus ondansetron on day 1 followed by placebo on days 2 and 3; addition of dexamethasone was allowed. Randomisation was stratified according to patient age, planned use of chemotherapy associated with very high risk of emetogenicity, and planned use of dexamethasone as an anti-emetic. Ondansetron was dosed per the product label for paediatric use or local standard of care. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved complete response (defined as no vomiting, no retching, and no use of rescue medication) during the 25-120 h (delayed phase) after initiation of emetogenic chemotherapy. Efficacy and safety analyses were done with all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01362530.\nFINDINGS: Between Sept 22, 2011, and Aug 16, 2013, 307 patients were randomly assigned at 49 sites in 24 countries to either the aprepitant group (155 patients) or to the control group (152 patients). Three patients in the aprepitant group and two in the control group did not receive study medication, and thus were excluded from analyses. 77 (51%) of 152 patients in the aprepitant group and 39 (26%) of 150 in the control group achieved a complete response in the delayed phase (p<0\u00b70001). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were febrile neutropenia (23 [15%] of 152 in the aprepitant group vs 21 [14%] of 150 in the control group), anaemia (14 [9%] vs 26 [17%]), and decreased neutrophil count (11 [7%] vs 17 [11%]). The most common serious adverse event was febrile neutropenia (23 [15%] patients in the aprepitant group vs 22 [15%] in the control group).\nINTERPRETATION: Addition of aprepitant to ondansetron with or without dexamethasone is effective for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in paediatric patients being treated with moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy.\nFUNDING: Merck & Co., Inc.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

Group differences in COVID-19 impact on families were also examined based on race and ethnicity, being medically and/or geographically underserved, and insurance status.\nMETHODS: Participants (n\u202f=\u202f131) included children with epilepsy and their families from two clinical trials. The Impact of COVID-19 on Pediatric Epilepsy Management (ICPEM) measure was developed and administered to caregivers online from April 2020 to September 2020 across four large pediatric hospitals. Administration of the ICPEM occurred both during routine study assessments and an additional acute time point to obtain information early in the pandemic (e.g., April and May 2020). Descriptive statistics and t-tests were used for analyses.\nRESULTS: Data indicate minor to moderate impact of COVID-19 on pediatric epilepsy management. Caregivers of children with epilepsy reported the most impact on education and social functioning. Adherence to CDC guidelines was reported to be high. Those having public insurance reported greater difficulties obtaining daily anti-seizure medications compared to those with private insurance.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study presents important initial data regarding the impact of COVID-19 epilepsy management and daily functioning in children with epilepsy and their families. While the acute impact of COVID-19 restrictions appear to be mild to moderate, it is unclear what the long-term impact of the pandemic will be on families of children with epilepsy.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

The European Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guidelines recently recommended prophylactic rectal indomethacin for all patients undergoing ERCP, including those at average risk for pancreatitis. We performed a randomized controlled trail to investigate the efficacy of this approach.\nMETHODS: We performed a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 449 consecutive patients undergoing ERCP at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, from March 2013 through December 2014. Approximately 70% of the cohort were at average risk for PEP. Subjects were assigned randomly to groups given either a single 100-mg dose of rectal indomethacin (n\u00a0= 223) or a placebo suppository (n\u00a0= 226) during the procedure. The primary outcome was the development of post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP), defined by new upper-abdominal pain, a lipase level more than 3-fold the upper limit of normal, and hospitalization after ERCP for 2 consecutive nights.\nRESULTS: There were no differences between the groups in baseline clinical or procedural characteristics. Sixteen patients in the indomethacin group (7.2%) and 11 in the placebo group (4.9%) developed PEP (P\u00a0= .33). Complications and the severity of PEP were similar between groups. Per a priori protocol guidelines, the study was stopped owing to futility.\nCONCLUSIONS: In a randomized controlled study of consecutive patients undergoing ERCP, rectal indomethacin did not prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis.

In subgroup analyses at 12 and 24 months, we evaluated factors (duration and type of aromatase inhibitor, tamoxifen use, age, time since menopause, body mass index, T-score) that might influence BMD at the lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck, and 1/3 radius. Patients were randomized to receive placebo (n = 125) or 60 mg denosumab (n = 127) subcutaneously every 6 months. In all subgroups, 12 or 24 months' treatment with denosumab was associated with larger BMD gains than placebo across multiple skeletal sites. Most increases were statistically significant (P < 0.05).

We also examined antidepressant use within the caregiver sample. An emphasis was placed upon effect size differences, including Cohen's d as well as more clinically meaningful effect sizes.\nRESULTS: Caregivers were significantly more likely to endorse depressive symptoms and to meet clinically significant cutoff for depression (40% for caregivers; 5% for noncaregivers). Approximately 25% of caregivers reported taking antidepressant medication, although 69% of these continued to experience significant symptoms of depression. Caregivers also utilized fewer positive coping and greater negative coping strategies than noncaregivers.\nCONCLUSION: The number of caregivers will increase dramatically over the next two decades, and caregivers will likely seek care from primary care providers.

Accuracy of the instrumentation is questionable, and assembly and disposal of the numerous pieces is time consuming. Navigation techniques are more accurate, but their broad application is limited by cost and complexity. We aimed to prove a new concept of computer-assisted preoperative planning to provide patient-specific templates that can replace conventional instruments. Computed tomography-based planning was used to design two virtual templates. Using rapid prototyping technology, virtual templates were transferred into physical templates (cutting blocks) with surfaces that matched the distal femur and proximal tibia. We performed 45 total knee arthroplasties on 16 cadaveric and 29 plastic knees, including a comparative trial against conventional instrumentations. All operations were performed using patient-specific templates with no conventional instrumentations, intramedullary perforation, tracking, or registration. The mean time for bone cutting was 9 minutes with a surgical assistant and 11 minutes without an assistant. Computer-assisted analyses of six random computed tomography scans showed mean errors for alignment and bone resection within 1.7 degrees and 0.8 mm (maximum, 2.3 degrees and 1.2 mm, respectively). Patient-specific templates are a practical alternative to conventional instrumentations, but additional clinical validation is required before clinical use.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

PCA3, serum prostate specific antigen and percent free prostate specific antigen results were correlated with biopsy outcome via univariate logistic regression and ROC analyses. Multivariate logistic regression was also performed including these biomarkers together with prostate volume, age and family history.\nRESULTS: PCA3 scores were measurable from 1,072 of 1,140 subjects (94% informative rate). PCA3 scores were associated with positive biopsy rate (p <0.0001) and correlated with biopsy Gleason score (p = 0.0017). PCA3 AUC of 0.693 was greater than serum prostate specific antigen (0.612, p = 0.0077 vs PCA3). The multivariate logistic regression model yielded an AUC of 0.753 and exclusion of PCA3 from the model decreased AUC to 0.717 (p = 0.0009). PCA3 at year 2 was a significant predictor of year 4 biopsy outcome (AUC 0.634, p = 0.0002), whereas serum prostate specific antigen and free prostate specific antigen were not predictive (p = 0.3281 and 0.6782, respectively).\nCONCLUSIONS: PCA3 clinical performance was validated in the largest repeat biopsy study to date. Increased PCA3 scores indicated increased risk of contemporaneous cancers and predicted future biopsy outcomes. Use of PCA3 in combination with serum prostate specific antigen and other risk factors significantly increased diagnostic accuracy.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

In the current article, the authors tested the hypothesis that an attention modification program would be effective in reducing anxiety response and improving performance on a public-speaking challenge. Socially anxious participants completed a probe detection task by identifying letters (E or F) replacing one member of a pair of faces (neutral or disgust). The authors trained attention by including a contingency between the location of the neutral face and the probe in one group (Attention Modification Program; AMP). Participants in the AMP group showed significantly less attention bias to threat after training and lower levels of anxiety in response to a public-speaking challenge than did the participants in the Attention Control Condition (ACC) group. Moreover, blind raters judged the speeches of those in the AMP group as better than those in the ACC group. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that attention plays a causal role in the maintenance of social anxiety.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Currently licensed pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) confer protection against PD caused by most vaccine serotypes, but non-vaccine serotypes contribute to residual disease. V114 is a 15-valent PCV containing all 13 serotypes in Prevnar 13\u2122 (PCV13) and additional serotypes 22F and 33F. This pivotal phase 3 study compared safety and immunogenicity of V114 and PCV13.\nMETHODS: 1720 healthy infants were randomized 1:1 to receive a 4-dose regimen of V114 or PCV13 concomitantly with other routine pediatric vaccines. Safety was evaluated after each dose as proportion of participants with adverse events (AEs). Serotype-specific anti-pneumococcal immunoglobulin G (IgG) was measured at 1-month post-dose 3 (PD3), pre-dose 4, and 1-month post-dose 4 (PD4). IgG response rates, geometric mean concentrations (GMCs), and opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) were compared between vaccination groups.\nRESULTS: The proportion, maximum intensity, and duration of injection-site, systemic, and serious AEs were generally comparable between V114 and PCV13 groups. In comparison to PCV13, V114 met non-inferiority criteria for all 15 serotypes based on IgG response rates at PD3. V114 met non-inferiority criteria by IgG GMCs for all serotypes at PD3 and PD4, except for serotype 6A at PD3. V114-induced antibodies had bactericidal activity as assessed by OPA. Further, V114 met superiority criteria for shared serotype 3 and unique serotypes 22F and 33F compared to PCV13 by serotype-specific IgG GMCs at both PD3 and PD4. Immunogenicity of concomitantly administered routine pediatric vaccines was comparable in V114 and PCV13 groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: In healthy infants, V114 displays acceptable safety and tolerability profiles and generates comparable immune responses to PCV13. V114 also met superiority criteria for serotypes 3, 22F, and 33F. These results support use of V114 for prevention of PD as part of routine infant vaccination schedules.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03893448; EudraCT: 2018-004109-21.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

Although guidelines recommend measuring it as a diagnostic tool for asthma, the usefulness of this approach has not been studied in children.\nAIM: To assess the usefulness of home spirometry in children with nonspecific lower respiratory tract symptoms, to diagnose or exclude asthma.\nMETHODS: In school-aged children, referred by their general practitioner because of chronic respiratory symptoms of unknown origin, the diagnosis of asthma was made or excluded by a pediatric pulmonologist (gold standard), based on international guidelines and a standardized protocol. Additionally, children measured peak expiratory flow (PEF) and forced expiratory flow in 1 sec (FEV(1)) twice daily for 2 weeks on a home spirometer, from which diurnal variation was calculated. These results (index test) were not revealed to the pediatric pulmonologist. The value of home spirometry to diagnose asthma was calculated.\nRESULTS: Sixty-one children (27 boys) were included (mean age: 10.4 years; range: 6-16 years). Between asthma and no asthma, the mean difference in PEF variation was 4.4% (95% CI: 0.9-7.9; P = 0.016) and in FEV(1) variation 4.5% (95% CI: 1.6-7.4; P = 0.003). Sensitivity and specificity, based on the 95th-centile of the reference values for PEF and FEV(1) variation (12.3% and 11.8%, respectively) were 50% and 72% for PEF variation and 45% and 92% for FEV(1) variation. The likelihood ratio was 1.8 for PEF and 5.6 for FEV(1).\nCONCLUSIONS: The contribution of home spirometry in the diagnostic process for asthma in schoolchildren with nonspecific respiratory symptoms is limited.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

According to the 'surviving sepsis campaign,' diagnosis of sepsis and infection is urgent; early and specific treatment is most effective to reduce complications and to decrease mortality.\nRECENT FINDINGS: A variety of biomarkers of sepsis is presently available. The diagnostic spectrum of the various markers, however, is different. Some primarily indicate severity of inflammation (e.g. interleukin-6), others respond to infection, but do not indicate the host response well (endotoxin, lipoprotein binding protein, triggering receptor on myeloid cells). There are new markers with limited clinical experience, for example triggering receptor on myeloid cells or mid-pro atrial natriuretic peptide (Seristra, Brahms AG, Hennigsdorf, Germany). Procalcitonin is a well-established biomarker of sepsis that fulfills several criteria of clinical needs: it responds both to infection and severity of inflammation and thus has an impact on therapy. Recent studies indicate that antibiotic treatment can also be guided by procalcitonin. Further indications, including diagnosis of invasive bacterial infections and diagnosis of sepsis in neonates and children have been reported recently.\nSUMMARY: Recent data and cumulative analyses indicate that biomarkers of sepsis improve diagnosis of sepsis. However, only a few markers have impact on therapy and fulfill the clinical requirements. Procalcitonin is a well-established marker, indicating infection, sepsis, and progression to the more severe stages of the disease. Today, this biomarker should be in the diagnostic portfolio of an intensive care unit or emergency ward.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

The objective of this analysis was to assess the cost-effectiveness of a nursing intervention on antiretroviral adherence using data from a randomized controlled clinical trial as input to a computer-based simulation model of HIV disease. For a cohort of HIV-infected patients similar to those in the clinical trial (mean initial CD4 count of 319 cells/mm), implementing the nursing intervention in addition to standard care yielded a 63% increase in virologic suppression at 48 weeks. This produced increases in expected survival (from 94.5 to 100.9 quality-adjusted life months) and estimated discounted direct lifetime medical costs ($253,800 to $261,300). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the intervention was $14,100 per quality-adjusted life year gained compared with standard care. Adherence interventions with modest effectiveness are likely to provide long-term survival benefit to patients and to be cost-effective compared with other uses of HIV care funds.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Findings from preclinical studies suggest that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and proton-pump inhibitors might enhance \u03b2-cell survival and regeneration. We postulated that sitagliptin and lansoprazole would preserve \u03b2-cell function in patients with recent-onset type 1 diabetes.\nMETHODS: We did a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial (REPAIR-T1D). Participants aged 11-36 years, diagnosed with type 1 diabetes within the past 6 months were recruited from Sanford Health Systems (Sioux Falls, SD, USA; Fargo, ND, USA), Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota (St Paul, MN, USA), and Rady Children's Hospital (San Diego, CA, USA). Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive oral sitagliptin (100 mg for participants \u226518 years, 50 mg for those <18 years) and lansoprazole (60 mg for participants \u226518 years, 30 mg for those <18 years) or matched placebo for 12 months. Randomisation was done by a blocked randomisation process (blocks of three and six), with separate streams for younger (<18 years) and older (\u226518 years) participants, and males and females. All participants and personnel remained masked until after the completion of the final 12 month visit, at which time data were unmasked to the analysis team. The primary endpoint was C-peptide response to a mixed meal challenge at 12 months measured as 2 h area under curve. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01155284.\nFINDINGS: Between Sept 21, 2010, and May 29, 2012, 46 participants were randomly assigned to the treatment group and 22 to the placebo group; of whom 40 participants in the treatment group and 18 in the placebo group completed the 12-month treatment. At 12 months, the mean change in C-peptide area under curve was -229 pmol/L (95% CI -316 to -142) for the treatment group and -253 pmol/L (-383 to -123) for the placebo group; this difference was not significant (p=0\u00b777). No adverse or serious adverse events were probably or definitely related to the study treatment.\nINTERPRETATION: Although the expected change in the primary endpoint was not achieved, not all participants had increases in glucagon-like peptide-1 and gastrin concentrations that were expected with treatment. Although participants did not have adverse events related to study drugs, the study is not powered to address safety definitively. Further trials including these drugs might be warranted, but should be designed to ensure appropriate selection of participants and increases in these intermediary hormones.\nFUNDING: Sanford Research and JDRF.\n## Response:\nFALSE"}

Sleep outcomes (sleep onset latency, total wake time, wake after sleep onset, sleep efficiency, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) were compared between CBTI and control at 6 months using repeated-measures analysis of variance adjusted for baseline values. AHI of 5 or greater versus less than 5 was included as an interaction term to evaluate changes in sleep outcomes. The number of participants at baseline and 6 months with mild SDB for whom insomnia was their only other indication for PAP was also compared between CBTI and control.\nRESULTS: AHI status (AHI \u2265 5 [75.5% of participants] versus AHI < 5) did not moderate improvements in sleep associated with CBTI (all p values \u2265 .12). Nine (45.0%) of 20 participants with mild SDB for whom insomnia was their only other indication for PAP therapy at baseline no longer had another indication for PAP at 6 months, with no significant difference between CBTI and control.\nCONCLUSIONS: CBTI improves sleep in older veterans with insomnia and untreated mild SDB.

The primary outcome was the change from baseline to cycle 6 for all indices.\nRESULTS: All parameters were similar at baseline between the two groups. Over six cycles, NOMAC/E2 had less effect on most haemostatic indices than LNG/EE. Lipids were essentially unchanged with NOMAC/E2, whereas with LNG/EE high-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides slightly increased. NOMAC/E2 induced negligible changes in glucose and insulin parameters, in contrast to LNG/EE. A much smaller increase in CRP was observed with NOMAC/E2 than with LNG/EE. NOMAC/E2 was associated with a greater increase in SHBG.\nCONCLUSIONS: The monophasic COC NOMAC/E2 had less influence on haemostasis, lipids and carbohydrate metabolism than the COC LNG/EE.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

After a 2-week, single-blind, lead-in period, subjects were randomly assigned (2 : 1) to add exenatide or placebo to current regimens. The primary endpoint was HbA(1c) change at endpoint (Week 26 or last-observation-carried-forward).\nRESULTS: Only 8 subjects were treated with concomitant TZD alone. Exenatide reduced HbA(1c) significantly more than placebo [-0.84% (s.e. 0.20) vs. -0.10% (0.23), treatment difference -0.74% (0.16), p < 0.001)]. Mean reductions in body weight were similar in both treatments at endpoint [exenatide, -1.4 (s.e. 0.6) kg vs. placebo, -0.8 (0.7) kg, p = 0.176)]. Nearly 71% of subjects had both a reduction in HbA(1c) and body weight with exenatide compared with 54% with placebo. The most common adverse events (exenatide vs. placebo) were nausea (12% vs. 2%, p = 0.037), vomiting (8% vs. 0%, p = 0.031) and headache (4% vs. 4%).

A subset of patients continued in a 48-week, single-arm extension receiving TNS4 only. The primary endpoint of the core phase was to demonstrate the non-inferiority of TNS4 compared to TNS5 in terms of absolute change from baseline to week 4 in FEV(1) % predicted. The assessment of long-term safety was the primary purpose of the extension phase. Throughout all phases of the study, microbiological assessments, adverse events, and audiometry findings were also evaluated.\nRESULTS: In the core phase (N\u2009=\u2009321), FEV(1) (% predicted) increased from baseline (absolute change) following a single on-treatment cycle for both TNS4 (7.0%) and TNS5 (7.5%) and the non-inferiority between treatments was met [difference between treatments of -0.5 (95% CI: -2.6; 1.6)]. These improvements were maintained throughout the extension phase (N\u2009=\u2009209), ranging throughout the study between 5.1% (95% CI: 3.2; 6.9) and 8.1% (95% CI: 6.8; 9.4) compared to baseline. Pa sputum count reductions ranged between 0.6 (95% CI: 0.2; 0.9) to 2.3 (95% CI: 2.0; 2.6) log10 CFU/g throughout the 56 weeks. No remarkable safety issues were identified throughout both study phases, with similar percentages of patients reporting adverse events in the two treatment groups during the 8-week core phase [TNS4 (31.4%); TNS5 (28.0%)].\nCONCLUSIONS: Overall, TNS4 demonstrated short-term clinical benefits similar to TNS5 which were maintained during the long-term use of TNS4 and was also associated with a favorable tolerability profile.\n## Response:\nFALSE"}

The primary end point was the rate of RBC transfusion independence (TI) \u2265 8 weeks. Secondary end points were RBC-TI \u2265 24 weeks, duration of RBC-TI, erythroid response, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and safety.\nRESULTS: RBC-TI \u2265 8 weeks was achieved in 26.9% and 2.5% of patients in the lenalidomide and placebo groups, respectively (P < .001). Ninety percent of patients achieving RBC-TI responded within 16 weeks of treatment. Median duration of RBC-TI with lenalidomide was 30.9 weeks (95% CI, 20.7 to 59.1). Transfusion reduction of \u2265 4 units packed RBCs, on the basis of a 112-day assessment, was 21.8% in the lenalidomide group and 0% in the placebo group. Higher response rates were observed in patients with lower baseline endogenous erythropoietin \u2264 500 mU/mL (34.0% v 15.5% for > 500 mU/mL). At week 12, mean changes in HRQoL scores from baseline did not differ significantly between treatment groups, which suggests that lenalidomide did not adversely affect HRQoL. Achievement of RBC-TI \u2265 8 weeks was associated with significant improvements in HRQoL (P < .01). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.\nCONCLUSION: Lenalidomide yields sustained RBC-TI in 26.9% of RBC transfusion-dependent patients with lower-risk non-del(5q) myelodysplastic syndromes ineligible for or refractory to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. Response to lenalidomide was associated with improved HRQoL. Treatment-emergent adverse event data were consistent with the known safety profile of lenalidomide.\n## Response:\nFALSE"}

The present study quantified net joint torques of the lower limbs and trunk in the sagittal and frontal planes following multi-directional surface translations. Twenty-one healthy subjects stood with feet on separate force plates mounted on a moveable platform, translated unexpectedly in one of 12 directions. Peak net torque magnitudes and latencies following perturbation onset were determined as were the relative contributions of each joint to total torque production. Magnitude of net torque generated by each leg varied by perturbation direction, with the largest individual joint magnitude elicited in directions of limb loading. Relative contributions of individual joint torques to the total response were dependent upon perturbation direction. Results suggest that a redistribution of the relative contributions of hip/trunk versus ankle strategies occurs dependent on perturbation direction, with a significant contribution by the knee joint in response to forward perturbations. Direction-specific redistribution of proximal versus distal strategies appears to depend upon the biomechanical constraints imposed by a given perturbation direction. Thus, it appears that sagittal and frontal plane posture-righting responses may not be uniquely controlled, and may instead be governed similarly, with modulation of relative torque contributions among joints when necessary, given direction-specific anatomical constraints.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Visits were grouped into 3 discrete time periods, 1993-1996, 1997-1999 and 2000-2002.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rate of diagnosis, type of mental health visit, type of treatment received (medication or psychotherapy), rate of psychotropic medications prescription, and specialty of the treating physician.\nRESULTS: From 1993-1996 to 2000-2002, the proportion of office visits in which mental health care was provided decreased for Hispanics from 12.2% to 11.7% while it increased from 13.1% to 15.7% for non-Hispanics (P < 0.05). Visits with a diagnosis of mental disorder decreased from 5.2% to 5.1% in Hispanics but increased from 6.0% to 8.8% in non-Hispanics (P < 0.05). Visits resulting in prescription of a psychotropic medication decreased from 10.2% to 9.3% in Hispanics, while they increased from 10.2% to 12.5% in non-Hispanics (P < 0.05). Psychotherapy visits decreased from 2.4% to 1.3% in Hispanics (P < 0.05), whereas they remained constant (2.5%) in non-Hispanics. Visits to a psychiatrist decreased from 2.5% to 1.3% in Hispanics (P < 0.05), while they increased (nonsignificantly) from 3.1% to 3.5% for non-Hispanics. Most differences persisted after adjusting for age and insurance status.\nCONCLUSIONS: From 1993 to 2002, there was an increase in mental health care disparities between Hispanics and non-Hispanics treated by office-based physicians. Improvement of the mental health care for Hispanics continues to be an important public health priority, with clear opportunities and challenges for health care policy-makers and practitioners.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Additionally, a comparison was made between the anxiety scores of this Italian adolescent cohort (N=1975) and a comparative Dutch adolescent cohort (N=1115). Findings revealed that a five-factor structure of the SCARED applied not only to the Italian adolescents from the general community, but also to boys and girls, and to early and middle adolescents. Moreover, sex and age differences on anxiety scores within the Italian sample were found to be consistent with previous studies of adolescent anxiety disorders. Finally, Italian adolescents reported higher anxiety scores than their Dutch peers. Findings of this study highlight that the SCARED is a valid screening instrument to rate anxiety symptoms of Italian adolescents.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

HbA1c levels (mean of 14 values/patient) were prospectively collected between 1990 and 1995 and tested for association with skin microcirculation. The patients were followed until first hospitalisation for an ischaemic foot ulcer or until 2011.\nRESULTS: During the median 28\u00a0years of follow-up, three patients developed ischaemic foot ulcers in the ICT group compared with ten in the ST group (logrank, p\u2009=\u20090.035). At the time of iontophoresis, HbA1c was lower in the ICT group (median 57\u00a0mmol/mol [minimum-maximum 40-79\u00a0mmol/mol]) compared with the ST group (68\u00a0mmol/mol [41-96\u00a0mmol/mol], p\u2009<\u20090.01) (DCCT: ICT 7.4% [5.8-9.4%] vs ST 8.4% [5.9-10.9%]). Stimulated blood flow was higher in the ICT vs ST group with significantly increased perfusion units (PU) for: ACh (8.1 PU [4.6-24.7 PU] vs 5.3 PU [1.7-21.4 PU], p\u2009<\u20090.01); SNP (8.1 PU [2.2-20.1 PU] vs 5.6 PU [2.3-19.2 PU], p\u2009=\u20090.03); and capsaicin (5.0 PU [1.7-22.9 PU] vs 3.4 PU [1.5-8.4 PU], p\u2009<\u20090.01). HbA1c was associated with vasodilatation induced by ACh (b\u2009=\u2009-0.02, p\u2009<\u20090.01) and capsaicin (b\u2009=\u2009-0.02, p\u2009=\u20090.03). HbA1c was independently associated with ACh (b\u2009=\u2009-1.48, p\u2009<\u20090.01) and capsaicin-induced vasodilatation (b\u2009=\u2009-1.45, p\u2009<\u20090.01).\nCONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Improved glycaemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes is associated with an improvement in skin microcirculation and with a lower incidence of ischaemic foot ulcers.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01957930.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Despite positive trends in survivorship, a cancer diagnosis can trigger accelerated functional decline that can threaten independence, reduce quality-of-life and increase healthcare costs, especially among the elderly who comprise the majority of survivors. Lifestyle interventions may hold promise in reorienting functional decline in older cancer survivors, but few studies have been conducted.\nMETHODS: We describe the design and methods of a randomized controlled trial, RENEW (Reach out to ENhancE Wellness), that tests whether a home-based multi-behavior intervention focused on exercise, and including a low saturated fat, plant-based diet, would improve physical functioning among 641 older, long-term (>or=5 years post-diagnosis) survivors of breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer. Challenges to recruitment are examined.\nRESULTS: Twenty thousand and fifteen cases were approached, and screened using a two-step screening process to assure eligibility. This population of long-term, elderly cancer survivors had lower rates of response (approximately 11%) and higher rates of ineligibility (approximately 70%) than our previous intervention studies conducted on adults with newly diagnosed cancer. Significantly higher response rates were noted among survivors who were White, younger, and more proximal to diagnosis and breast cancer survivors (p-values<0.001).\nCONCLUSION: Older cancer survivors represent a vulnerable population for whom lifestyle interventions may hold promise. RENEW may provide guidance in allocating limited resources in order to maximize recruitment efforts aimed at this needy, but hard-to-reach population.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

We evaluated the effectiveness of integrated care centres in India that provided single-venue HIV testing, prevention, and treatment services for people who inject drugs (PWID) and men who have sex with men (MSM).\nMETHODS: We did baseline respondent-driven sampling surveys in 27 sites across India, and selected 22 of these (12 PWID and ten MSM) for a cluster randomised trial on the basis of high HIV prevalence and logistical considerations. We used stratified (by PWID and MSM), restricted randomisation to allocate sites to either the integrated care intervention or usual care (11 sites per group). We implemented integrated care centres in 11 cities (six PWID integrated care centres embedded within opioid agonist treatment centres and five MSM centres within government-sponsored health services), with a single integrated care centre per city in all but one city. After a 2-year intervention phase, we did respondent-driven sampling evaluation surveys of target population members who were aged 18 years or older at all sites. The primary outcome was self-reported HIV testing in the previous 12 months (recent testing), determined via the evaluation survey. We used a biometric identification system to estimate integrated care centre exposure (visited an integrated care centre at least once) among evaluation survey participants at intervention sites. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01686750.\nFINDINGS: Between Oct 1, 2012, and Dec 19, 2013, we recruited 11\u2008993 PWID and 9997 MSM in the baseline survey and, between Aug, 1 2016, and May 27, 2017, surveyed 11\u2008721 PWID and 10\u2008005 MSM in the evaluation survey using respondent-driven sampling, across the 22 trial sites. During the intervention phase, integrated care centres provided HIV testing for 14\u2008698 unique clients (7630 PWID and 7068 MSM. In the primary population-level analysis, recent HIV testing was 31% higher at integrated care centres than at usual care sites (adjusted prevalence ratio [PR] 1\u00b731, 95% CI 0\u00b795-1\u00b781, p=0\u00b709). Among survey participants at intervention sites, integrated care centre exposure was lower than expected (median exposure 40% at PWID sites and 24% at MSM sites). In intervention sites, survey participants who visited an integrated care centre were more likely to report recent HIV testing than were participants who had not (adjusted PR 3\u00b746, 2\u00b794-4\u00b706).\nINTERPRETATION: Although integrated care centres increased HIV testing among visitors, our low exposure findings suggest that the scale-up of a single integrated care centre in most cities was insufficient to serve the large PWID and MSM populations. Future work should address the use of population size estimates to guide the dose of combination HIV interventions targeting key populations.\nFUNDING: US National Institutes of Health and the Elton John AIDS Foundation.\n## Response:\nFALSE"}

Improving health outcomes and reducing costs will depend on whether employees sustain lifestyle changes and maintain a healthy weight over time.\nPURPOSE: To determine if a 9-month maintenance intervention immediately following a 10-week worksite exercise and nutrition program would prevent regain of the weight lost during the program.\nDESIGN: RCT.\nSETTING/PARTICIPANTS: In 2008, a total of 330 employees from 24 teams completed a 10-week exercise and nutrition program at a large hospital worksite and were randomized by team to maintenance or control (usual care) for 9 months.\nINTERVENTION: Internet support with a website for goal-setting and self-monitoring of weight and exercise plus minimal personal support.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Weight loss, percentage weight loss, time spent in physical activity, and frequency of consumption of fruits/vegetables, fatty foods, and sugary foods at 1 year compared to baseline. One-year follow-up was completed in 2010, and data were analyzed in 2011.\nRESULTS: At 1 year, 238 subjects (72%) completed follow-up assessments. Mean baseline BMI was 27.6 and did not differ between intervention and control. Compared to baseline, both groups lost weight during the 10-week program and maintained 65% of weight loss at 1 year (p<0.001). There was no difference in weight loss between groups at the end of the 10-week program (4.8 lbs vs 4.3 lbs, p=0.53 for group X time interaction) or end of maintenance at 1 year (3.4 lbs vs 2.5 lbs, p=0.40 for group X time interaction). All subjects had improvements in physical activity and nutrition (increased fruits/vegetables and decreased fat and sugar intake) at 1 year but did not differ by group.\nCONCLUSIONS: An intensive 10-week team-based worksite exercise and nutrition program resulted in moderate weight loss and improvements in diet and exercise behaviors at 1 year, but an Internet-based maintenance program immediately following the 10-week program did not improve these outcomes.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov NCT00707577.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

However, most of the literature involves penetrating colon injuries. There are few reports describing complications following penetrating stomach and small bowel injuries. Based on the hypothesis that SSIs are commonly found following penetrating stomach and small bowel trauma, a prospective observational study was performed at an academic Level I trauma center from March 1, 2004 until August 31, 2006. The subjects were patients who had sustained a penetrating injury to the stomach or small bowel. Patients were followed for the development of an SSI, defined as wound infection, fascial dehiscence, or intraabdominal abscess. A total of 178 patients were admitted with penetrating stomach or small bowel injuries over the 29-month period. There were 121 (68%) gunshot injuries and 57 (32%) stab wounds. Associated intraabdominal injuries occurred in 74% of patients. Overall, SSIs occurred in 20% of cases. Risk factors for SSI included associated duodenal or colon injury, whereas time to operating room, blood loss, and type and duration of antibiotic use were not. When associated colon injuries were excluded, SSIs occurred in 16% of patients with gastric injuries and 13% of those with small bowel injuries. SSIs commonly follow penetrating stomach and small bowel trauma. Risk factors for SSI include associated duodenal or colon injury. Delay to operating room, blood loss, and type and length of antibiotic prophylaxis were not associated with an increased risk of SSI.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Several options for preventing PPH are available, but further advances in this field are important, especially the identification of safe, easy to use and cost-effective regimens. Tranexamic acid (TA), which is an antifibrinolytic agent that is used widely to prevent and treat haemorrhage, merits evaluation to assess whether it meets these criteria.\nOBJECTIVES: To determine, from the best available evidence, whether TA is effective and safe for preventing PPH in comparison to placebo or no treatment (with or without uterotonic co-treatment), or to uterotonic agents.\nSEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (28 January 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: All published, unpublished and ongoing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the use of TA alone or in addition to uterotonics in the third stage of labour or during caesarean section (CS) to prevent PPH.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed for inclusion all the potential studies identified as a result of the search strategy. We entered the data into Review Manager software and checked for accuracy.\nMAIN RESULTS: Twelve trials involving 3285 healthy women at low risk of excessive bleeding undergoing elective CS (nine trials, 2453 participants) or spontaneous birth (three trials, 832 participants) satisfied inclusion criteria and contributed data to the analysis. All participants received routine prophylactic uterotonics in accordance with the local guideline in addition to TA or placebo or no intervention. Overall, included studies had moderate risk of bias for random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, selective reporting and low risk of bias for incomplete data. The quality of evidence was also as assessed using GRADE.Blood loss greater than 400 mL or 500 mL, and more than 1000 mL was less common in women who received TA versus placebo or no intervention (risk ratio (RR) 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42 to 0.63, six trials, 1398 women; moderate quality evidence) and (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.71, six trials, 2093 women; moderate quality evidence), respectively. TA was effective in decreasing the incidence of blood loss greater than 1000 mL in women who had undergone CS (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.23, 0.78, four trials, 1534 women), but not vaginal birth (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.06, 1.36, two trials 559 women). The effect of TA on blood loss greater than 500 mL or 400 mL was more pronounced in the group of women having vaginal birth than in women who had CS. Mean blood loss (from delivery until two hours postpartum) was lower in women who received TA versus placebo or no intervention (mean difference MD - 77.79 mL, 95% CI -97.95, -57.64, five trials, 1186 women) and this effect was similar following vaginal birth and CS.Additional medical interventions (moderate quality evidence) and blood transfusions were less frequent in women receiving TA versus placebo or no interventions. Mild side effects such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness were more common with the use of TA (moderate quality evidence). The effect of TA on maternal mortality, severe morbidity and thromboembolic events is uncertain (low quality evidence).\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: TA (in addition to uterotonic medications) decreases postpartum blood loss and prevents PPH and blood transfusions following vaginal birth and CS in women at low risk of PPH based on studies of mixed quality. There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about serious side effects, but there is an increase in the incidence of minor side effects with the use of TA. Effects of TA on thromboembolic events and mortality as well as its use in high-risk women should be investigated further.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Outcome analyses were adjusted for participation bias.\nRESULTS: During 7908 person-months of observation, the prevalences of gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, trichomoniasis, and BV declined significantly and CCU increased significantly, with similar trends in both clinics. During follow-up, gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, trichomoniasis, and BV were negatively associated with follow-up after screening. BV also was positively associated with use of an intrauterine device and negatively with douching. CCU during follow-up was associated with significantly decreased risk of gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, and trichomoniasis.\nCONCLUSIONS: Strengthened periodic screening for and treatment of confirmed STD, in addition to condom promotion and provision, represent feasible, effective interventions in commercial sex, and time series analyses can provide a useful approach to evaluating new interventions.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Mothers who contacted the Beilinson Teratology Information Service (BELTIS) regarding use of tranexamic acid while breastfeeding were followed up by phone interview. Data on lactation, neonatal symptoms, and outcomes at the age of 1-3 years were obtained. Mothers' breastfeeding while taking tranexamic acid and their infants were compared with those of a matched control group of breastfeeding mothers using a drug known to be safe during lactation (amoxicillin) and their infants.\nRESULTS: Follow-up was obtained for 28 of 32 women who sought advice regarding use of tranexamic acid during breastfeeding. Of the 28 women, six did not take the drug, and one refused to participate. The 21 remaining women (study group) were compared with 42 control women. A decreased amount of breastmilk was reported by one woman in the study group versus two women in the control group (p=1.0). Possible adverse drug effects were reported for one of 21 study group infants (restlessness) and for one of 42 control group infants (gastroesophageal reflux) (p=1.0).

The aim of our study was to improve the understanding of gene expression profile of cumulus cells (CC) in terms of ovarian stimulation protocol and oocyte maturity. We applied Affymetrix gene expression profiling in CC of oocytes at different maturation stages using either GnRH agonists or GnRH antagonists. Two analyses were performed: the first involved CC of immature metaphase I (MI) and mature metaphase II (MII) oocytes where 359 genes were differentially expressed, and the second involved the two GnRH analogues where no differentially expressed genes were observed at the entire transcriptome level. A further analysis of 359 differentially genes was performed, focusing on anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone receptor 2 (AMHR2), follicle stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGFC) and serine protease inhibitor E2 (SERPINE2). Among other differentially expressed genes we observed a marked number of new genes connected to cell adhesion and neurotransmitters such as dopamine, glycine and \u03b3-Aminobutyric acid (GABA). No differential expression in CC between the two GnRH analogues supports the findings of clinical studies where no significant difference in live birth rates between both GnRH analogues has been proven.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Seventeen abstinent AD patients with insomnia (6 women, mean age 46.2 \u00b1 10.1 years) were randomized to 8 sessions of cognitive-behavioral treatment for insomnia for AD (CBTI-AD, n=9) or to a behavioral placebo treatment (BPT, n=8). Subjective measures of sleep, daytime consequences of insomnia and AD, alcohol use, and treatment fidelity were collected at baseline and post-treatment. Diary-rated sleep efficiency and wake after sleep onset, and daytime ratings of General Fatigue on the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory improved more in the CBTI-AD compared to the BPT group. In addition, more subjects were classified as treatment responders following CBTI-AD. No group differences were found in the number of participants who relapsed to any drinking or who relapsed to heavy drinking. The findings suggest that cognitive-behavioral insomnia therapy benefits subjective sleep and daytime symptoms in recovering AD participants with insomnia more than placebo. The benefits of treating insomnia on drinking outcomes are less apparent.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

This single-center, randomized, vehicle-controlled, double-blind, phase II study was designed to ensure the safety of multiple intra-articular injections of LMWF-5A and to explore its efficacy in reducing pain as a result of knee osteoarthritis. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive 3 biweekly intra-articular knee injections of either 4 mL LMWF-5A or vehicle control (saline), administered at weeks 0 (baseline), 2, and 4. Safety was examined as the incidence and severity of adverse events. Efficacy was assessed by the mean (SD) change between treatment groups in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain score from baseline to week 20. A total of 40 patients were randomized and received treatment. No drug-related serious adverse events and no deaths were reported. Adverse events were similar in patients who received saline (18, 90%) and LMWF-5A (19, 95%). Those treated with LMWF-5A had a significant decrease in pain at 20 weeks compared with the saline group (-1.41 [SD, 0.81] vs -0.85 [SD, 0.64], P=.02), corresponding to improvement in pain at week 20 of 64% with LMWF-5A compared with 40% with saline. This preliminary clinical trial showed that repeated intra-articular injections of LMWF-5A are safe when administered at 2-week intervals and are effective in providing relief of the pain of osteoarthritis of the knee at 20 weeks.

Here, we evaluated beremagene geperpavec (B-VEC), an engineered, non-replicating COL7A1 containing herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) vector, to treat RDEB skin. B-VEC restored C7 expression in RDEB keratinocytes, fibroblasts, RDEB mice and human RDEB xenografts. Subsequently, a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 1 and 2 clinical trial (NCT03536143) evaluated matched wounds from nine RDEB patients receiving topical B-VEC or placebo repeatedly over 12\u2009weeks. No grade 2 or above B-VEC-related adverse events or vector shedding or tissue-bound skin immunoreactants were noted. HSV-1 and C7 antibodies sometimes presented at baseline or increased after B-VEC treatment without an apparent impact on safety or efficacy. Primary and secondary objectives of C7 expression, anchoring fibril assembly, wound surface area reduction, duration of wound closure, and time to wound closure following B-VEC treatment were met. A patient-reported pain-severity secondary outcome was not assessed given the small proportion of wounds treated. A global assessment secondary endpoint was not pursued due to redundancy with regard to other endpoints. These studies show that B-VEC is an easily administered, safely tolerated, topical molecular corrective therapy promoting wound healing in patients with RDEB.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

In a randomized, phase 3 trial of 1,776 patients with metastases from solid tumors (except breast or prostate) or multiple myeloma, denosumab was non-inferior to zoledronic acid (ZA) in delaying or preventing SREs. This ad hoc analysis reports outcomes in the subgroup of 1,597 patients with solid tumors, excluding patients with multiple myeloma.\nMETHODS: Patients received monthly subcutaneous denosumab 120 mg or intravenous ZA 4 mg, adjusted for creatinine clearance, with calcium and vitamin D supplementation recommended. Endpoints included times to first on-study SRE, first-and-subsequent SREs, and pain worsening.\nRESULTS: Denosumab significantly delayed time to first on-study SRE compared with ZA (HR, 0.81; 95 % CI, 0.68-0.96) and time to first-and-subsequent SREs (RR, 0.85; 95 % CI, 0.72-1.00). Denosumab also significantly delayed time to development of moderate or severe pain (HR, 0.81; 95 % CI, 0.66-1.00), pain worsening (HR, 0.83; 95 % CI, 0.71-0.97), and worsening pain interference in patients with no/mild baseline pain (HR, 0.77; 95 % CI, 0.61-0.96). Adverse event rates were 96 % in both groups. Grade 3 or 4 hypocalcemia, mostly without clinical sequelae, was more frequent in denosumab-treated patients (denosumab 4 %, ZA 2 %). Osteonecrosis of the jaw occurred infrequently (denosumab 0.8 %, ZA 1.1 %).\nCONCLUSIONS: Denosumab was more effective in delaying or preventing SREs in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors and also prevented pain progression compared to ZA in this ad hoc analysis.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Before and at the end of treatment period, lipid profile and monocyte expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) were measured.\nRESULTS: At baseline no difference in lipid profile and monocyte expression of TNF and IL-1beta were observed between the two groups. In patients allocated to diet alone, no change in lipid profile and monocyte expression of TNF and IL-1beta was seen. In patients with diet plus simvastatin, significant decreases of total cholesterol (-27%, p<0.02), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (-33%, p<0.02), and monocyte expression of TNF (-49%, p<0.02) and IL-1beta (-35%, p<0.02) were observed. At the end of treatment period, patients treated with simvastatin had lower cholesterol and monocyte TNF and IL-1beta than did patients assigned to diet alone.\nCONCLUSION: This study suggests that simvastatin possesses anti-inflammatory activity via the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-1beta expressed by monocytes.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

We aimed to assess two dose fractionation schedules in patients with painful bone metastases needing repeat radiation therapy.\nMETHODS: We did a multicentre, non-blinded, randomised, controlled trial in nine countries worldwide. We enrolled patients 18 years or older who had radiologically confirmed, painful (ie, pain measured as \u22652 points using the Brief Pain Inventory) bone metastases, had received previous radiation therapy, and were taking a stable dose and schedule of pain-relieving drugs (if prescribed). Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either 8 Gy in a single fraction or 20 Gy in multiple fractions by a central computer-generated allocation sequence using dynamic minimisation to conceal assignment, stratified by previous radiation fraction schedule, response to initial radiation, and treatment centre. Patients, caregivers, and investigators were not masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was overall pain response at 2 months, which was defined as the sum of complete and partial pain responses to treatment, assessed using both Brief Pain Inventory scores and changes in analgesic consumption. Analysis was done by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00080912.\nFINDINGS: Between Jan 7, 2004, and May 24, 2012, we randomly assigned 425 patients to each treatment group. 19 (4%) patients in the 8 Gy group and 12 (3%) in the 20 Gy group were found to be ineligible after randomisation, and 140 (33%) and 132 (31%) patients, respectively, were not assessable at 2 months and were counted as missing data in the intention-to-treat analysis. In the intention-to-treat population, 118 (28%) patients allocated to 8 Gy treatment and 135 (32%) allocated to 20 Gy treatment had an overall pain response to treatment (p=0\u00b721; response difference of 4\u00b700% [upper limit of the 95% CI 9\u00b72, less than the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 10%]). In the per-protocol population, 116 (45%) of 258 patients and 134 (51%) of 263 patients, respectively, had an overall pain response to treatment (p=0\u00b717; response difference 6\u00b700% [upper limit of the 95% CI 13\u00b72, greater than the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 10%]). The most frequently reported acute radiation-related toxicities at 14 days were lack of appetite (201 [56%] of 358 assessable patients who received 8 Gy vs 229 [66%] of 349 assessable patients who received 20 Gy; p=0\u00b7011) and diarrhoea (81 [23%] of 357 vs 108 [31%] of 349; p=0\u00b7018). Pathological fractures occurred in 30 (7%) of 425 patients assigned to 8 Gy and 20 (5%) of 425 assigned to 20 Gy (odds ratio [OR] 1\u00b754, 95% CI 0\u00b785-2\u00b775; p=0\u00b715), and spinal cord or cauda equina compressions were reported in seven (2%) of 425 versus two (<1%) of 425, respectively (OR 3\u00b754, 95% CI 0\u00b773-17\u00b715; p=0\u00b7094).\nINTERPRETATION: In patients with painful bone metastases requiring repeat radiation therapy, treatment with 8 Gy in a single fraction seems to be non-inferior and less toxic than 20 Gy in multiple fractions; however, as findings were not robust in a per-protocol analysis, trade-offs between efficacy and toxicity might exist.\nFUNDING: Canadian Cancer Society Research Institute, US National Cancer Institute, Cancer Council Australia, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Dutch Cancer Society, and Assistance Publique-H\u00f4pitaux de Paris.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

Spine surgery, particularly procedures performed for deformity correction and procedures involving long arthrodesis constructs, can be associated with a large amount of blood loss requiring blood transfusions. The purpose of the present study was to determine if antifibrinolytic agents reduced blood transfusions in patients managed with spine surgery and to see if one agent had a greater effect than another.\nMETHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the available literature were performed to investigate the efficacy of aprotinin, tranexamic acid, and epsilon-aminocaproic acid in terms of reducing blood loss and blood transfusions in patients undergoing spine surgery. This meta-analysis was focused on the role of these agents in major spine operations as reported in eighteen clinical trials that included information on the drug dosage, the age of the patient, blood loss, blood transfusions, surgery complexity, and complications.\nRESULTS: Compared with control groups, the treatment groups for all three antifibrinolytic agents maintained lower levels of total blood loss and transfusions associated with spine surgery. The effect size (d) of the differences in total blood loss between the treatment and control groups ranged from -0.668 (95% confidence interval, -0.971 to -0.365) to -0.936 (95% confidence interval, -1.240 to -0.632) across all three agents. The effect size (d) of the differences in total blood transfusions between the treatment and control groups ranged from -0.466 (95% confidence interval, -0.764 to -0.167) to -0.749 (95% confidence interval, -1.046 to -0.453) across all three agents.\nCONCLUSIONS: Aprotinin, tranexamic acid, and epsilon-aminocaproic acid are effective for reducing blood loss and transfusions in patients managed with spine surgery. With the exception of aprotinin, the side-effect profiles of these agents have not been shown to cause any substantial morbidity or to increase the rate of thromboembolic events. Epsilon-aminocaproic acid had a greater effect on reducing blood transfusions as the complexity of surgery increased. The surgeon and/or the anesthesiologist should consider the use of antifibrinolytic agents for patients undergoing spinal procedures in which a large amount of blood loss can be expected; however, at the present time, this is not a United States Food and Drug Administration-approved indication for these agents.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

After a 2-week washout period, patients with confirmed symptomatic BPH were treated with tamsulosin 0.2mg daily. International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS), quality-of-life (QOL) index, maximum urinary flow rate (Q(max)) and average urinary flow rate (Q(ave)) were the efficacy parameters. Adverse events and variations in blood pressure and heart rate were also monitored.\nRESULTS: Total I-PSS and QOL index scores were improved from baseline with an average score reduction of 7.50 and 1.40, respectively (p < 0.01). Mean Q(max) and Q(ave) were increased by an average of 4.33 mL/sec (p < 0.01) and 2.04 mL/sec, respectively (p < 0.01). A subgroup analysis showed that total I-PSS, QOL index and Q(max) were significantly improved irrespective of baseline I-PSS, age, duration of BPH, comorbid conditions, or the use of concomitant antihypertensive agents. A positive correlation was noted between improvement in total I-PSS and QOL index (r = 0.70).

The primary outcome was the change from baseline to cycle 6 for all indices.\nRESULTS: All parameters were similar at baseline between the two groups. Over six cycles, NOMAC/E2 had less effect on most haemostatic indices than LNG/EE. Lipids were essentially unchanged with NOMAC/E2, whereas with LNG/EE high-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides slightly increased. NOMAC/E2 induced negligible changes in glucose and insulin parameters, in contrast to LNG/EE. A much smaller increase in CRP was observed with NOMAC/E2 than with LNG/EE. NOMAC/E2 was associated with a greater increase in SHBG.\nCONCLUSIONS: The monophasic COC NOMAC/E2 had less influence on haemostasis, lipids and carbohydrate metabolism than the COC LNG/EE.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

Interventions have been developed to improve community-based ADHD care but have not demonstrated that better care results in improved patient outcomes. The objective of this study was to determine whether an ADHD quality improvement (QI) intervention for community-based pediatric practices improves patient outcomes.\nMETHODS: A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted in which 50 community-based pediatric primary care practices (213 providers) were randomized either to receive a technology-assisted QI intervention or to a control condition. The intervention consisted of 4 training sessions, office flow modification, guided QI, and an ADHD Internet portal to assist with treatment monitoring. ADHD treatment processes and parent- and teacher-rated ADHD symptoms over the first year of treatment were collected for 577 patients.\nRESULTS: Intent-to-treat analyses examining outcomes of all children assessed for ADHD were not significant (b = -1.97, P = .08). However, among the 373 children prescribed ADHD medication, there was a significant intervention effect (b = -2.42, P = .04) indicating greater reductions in parent ratings of ADHD symptoms after treatment among patients treated by intervention physicians compared with patients treated at control practices. There were no group differences on teacher ratings of ADHD symptoms. ADHD treatment care around medication was significantly better at intervention practices compared with control practices.\nCONCLUSIONS: A technology-assisted QI intervention improved some ADHD care quality and resulted in additional reductions in parent-rated ADHD symptoms among patients prescribed ADHD medications.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

Maximum follow-up at time of analysis was 80.1 months.\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Skeletal-related events (SREs), common sequelae of metastatic cancer, are reduced by bisphosphonates. In this study, it was postulated that radiopharmaceuticals, added to bisphosphonates, could further decrease the incidence of SREs.\nMETHODS: NRG Oncology RTOG 0517 randomized patients with breast, lung, and prostate cancer and blastic bone metastases to either zoledronic acid (ZA) alone or ZA plus radiopharmaceuticals (Sr-89 or Sm-153). The primary endpoint was time to development of SREs. Secondary objectives included quality of life (QOL), pain control, overall survival (OS), and toxicity.\nRESULTS: 261 patients (median age 68; 62% male; 55% prostate, 35% breast, 10% lung) were accrued between July 2006 and February 2011. The study closed early due to a lower than expected rate of SREs. 52 (42%) patients in the ZA arm and 49 (40%) in the radiopharmaceutical arm experienced an SRE. Median time free of SREs was 29.9 and 27.4\u00a0months, respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.84). Median OS in the ZA arm and radiopharmaceutical arms was 32.1 and 26.9\u00a0months, respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.37). Cox proportional hazards regression model showed that primary disease site (lung) and number of bone metastases (>\u20092) had a negative impact on OS (p\u2009<\u20090.0001, p\u2009=\u20090.01, respectively). The addition of radiopharmaceuticals to ZA led to a significant reduction in pain at 1\u00a0month based on BPI worst score (p\u2009=\u20090.02). No other group differences were noted for QOL or toxicity.\nCONCLUSION: The addition of radiopharmaceuticals to bisphosphonates did not alter time to SREs or OS for patients with breast, lung, prostate cancers and blastic bone metastases, although it was associated with significant pain reduction at 1\u00a0month.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRY: This protocol (RTOG 0517) is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00365105), and may be viewed online at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00365105?term=RTOG+0517&rank=1 .\n## Response:\nFALSE"}

We compared PCC and FFP intraoperative administration in patients undergoing heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).\nMETHODS: Forty patients [with international normalized ratio (INR)\u2265 2\u00b71] assigned semi-urgent cardiac surgery were randomized to receive either FFP (n = 20) or PCC (n = 20). Prior to CPB, they received either 2 units of FFP or half of the PCC dose calculated according to body weight, initial INR and target INR ( \u2264 1\u00b75). After CPB and protamine administration, patients received either another 2 units of FFP or the other half PCC dose. Additional doses were administered if INR was still too high ( \u2265 1\u00b75).\nRESULTS: Fifteen minutes after CPB, more patients reached INR target with PCC (P = 0\u00b7007): 7/16 patients vs. 0/15 patients with FFP; there was no difference 1 h after CPB (6/15 patients with PCC vs. 4/15 patients with FFP reached target). Fifteen minutes after CPB, median INR (range) decreased to 1\u00b76 (1\u00b72-2\u00b72) with PCC vs. 2\u00b73 (1\u00b75-3\u00b75) with FFP; 1 h after CPB both groups reached similar values [1\u00b76 (1\u00b73-2\u00b72) with PCC and 1\u00b77 (1\u00b73-2\u00b77) with FFP]. With PCC, less patients needed additional dose (6/20) than with FFP (20/20) (P < 0\u00b7001). Both groups differed significantly on the course of factor II (P = 0\u00b70023) and factor X (P = 0\u00b7008) over time. Dilution of coagulation factors was maximal at CPB onset. Safety was good for both groups, with only two related oozing cases with FFP.\nCONCLUSION: PCC reverses anticoagulation safely, faster and with less bleeding than FFP.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Palifermin reduces mucositis when given in multiple doses to patients undergoing hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation.\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of palifermin given as a single dose before each cycle in patients receiving multicycle chemotherapy.\nDESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00267046)\nSETTING: The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.\nPATIENTS: 48 patients with sarcoma were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive palifermin or placebo. All patients received doxorubicin-based chemotherapy (90 mg per m(2) of body surface area over 3 days, by infusion).\nINTERVENTION: Palifermin (180 \u00b5g per kg of body weight) or placebo was administered intravenously as a single dose 3 days before each chemotherapy cycle (maximum, 6 cycles). Patients who had severe mucositis received open-label palifermin in subsequent cycles.\nMEASUREMENTS: Oral assessment of mucositis by using World Health Organization (WHO) oral toxicity scale (grades 0 to 4), with moderate to severe mucositis (grades 2 to 4) as the main outcomes; patient-reported outcome questionnaire; and daily symptom record diary.\nRESULTS: A median of 6 blinded cycles (range, 1 to 6) were completed by the palifermin group and 2 (range, 1 to 6) by the placebo group. Compared with placebo, palifermin reduced the cumulative incidence of moderate to severe (grade 2 or higher) mucositis (44% vs. 88%; P < 0.001; difference, -44 percentage points [95% CI, -71 to -16 percentage points) and severe (grade 3 or 4) mucositis (13% vs. 51%; P = 0.002; difference, -38 percentage points [CI, -67 to -9 percentage points]). The main adverse effects were thickening of oral mucosa (72% in the palifermin group vs. 31% in the placebo group; P = 0.007) and altered taste. Seven of the 8 patients who had severe mucositis in the placebo group received open-label palifermin. None of these patients had severe mucositis in the subsequent cycles (a total of 17) with open-label palifermin.\nLIMITATIONS: Study limitations include smaller sample size for the control group, inclusion of only patients with sarcoma, and perceived unblinding of the treatment because of notable differences between the biologic effects of palifermin and placebo.\nCONCLUSION: A single dose of palifermin before each cycle reduced the incidence and severity of mucositis. The drug was generally well tolerated, but most patients experienced thickening of oral mucosa. Further investigation is needed to determine whether palifermin use will facilitate greater adherence to chemotherapy regimens by reducing mucositis.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

We report the results of OPUS-2, a phase III study evaluating the efficacy and safety of lifitegrast compared with placebo for the treatment of DED.\nDESIGN: A 12-week, multicenter, randomized, prospective, double-masked, placebo-controlled clinical trial.\nPARTICIPANTS: Adults aged \u226518 years with use of artificial tears within 30 days, inferior corneal staining score\u00a0\u22650.5 (0-4 scale), Schirmer tear test (without anesthesia) \u22651 and \u226410 mm, and eye dryness score \u226540 (0-100 visual analogue scale [VAS]).\nMETHODS: Subjects were randomized 1:1 after 14-day placebo run-in to lifitegrast ophthalmic solution 5.0% or placebo twice daily for 84 days.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Co-primary efficacy end points were change, from baseline to day 84, in eye dryness score (VAS, both eyes) and inferior corneal fluorescein staining score in the designated study eye. Secondary end points were change, from baseline to day 84, in ocular discomfort score (0-4 scale) in study eye, eye discomfort score (VAS), total corneal staining score in the study eye, and nasal conjunctival lissamine green staining score (0-4 scale) in the study eye. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were recorded.\nRESULTS: A total of 718 subjects were randomized: placebo, n = 360; lifitegrast, n = 358 (intent-to-treat population). Lifitegrast-treated subjects experienced greater improvement in eye dryness than placebo-treated subjects (treatment effect, 12.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 8.51-16.70; P < 0.0001). There was no between-group difference in inferior corneal staining (treatment effect, 0.03; 95% CI,\u00a0-0.10 to 0.17; P\u00a0= 0.6186). There was nominally significant improvement of secondary symptom end points among lifitegrast-treated subjects: ocular discomfort (nominal P\u00a0= 0.0005) and eye discomfort (nominal, P < 0.0001). There were no between-group differences on secondary signs: total corneal staining and nasal lissamine staining. More lifitegrast-treated subjects (33.7%) than placebo-treated subjects (16.4%) experienced ocular TEAEs; no ocular TEAEs were serious.\nCONCLUSIONS: Lifitegrast met the co-primary symptom end point (eye dryness) but not the co-primary sign end point (inferior corneal staining). Secondary end point findings were consistent with this pattern. Most ocular TEAEs were mild to moderate; there were no unexpected TEAEs. Lifitegrast warrants further consideration as a treatment for DED.\n## Response:\nFALSE"}

Brain MRIs were performed quarterly. The primary endpoint (PEP) was development of \u2265 3 new T2 lesions, or one clinical relapse within 12 months. Subjects meeting the PEP were offered additional weekly interferon \u03b2-1a (IFN\u03b2-1a).\nRESULTS: Due to slow recruitment, enrollment was discontinued after 81 of 152 planned subjects with CIS were randomized and initiated study drug. Median (interquartile range) numbers of T2 and gadolinium-enhancing (Gd) lesions were 15.0 (22.0) and 0.0 (0.0) at baseline. A total of 53.1% of atorvastatin recipients (n = 26/49) met PEP compared to 56.3% of placebo recipients (n = 18/32) (p = 0.82). Eleven atorvastatin subjects (22.4%) and 7 placebo subjects (21.9%) met the PEP by clinical criteria. Proportion of subjects who did not develop new T2 lesions up to month 12 or to starting IFN\u03b2-1a was 55.3% in the atorvastatin and 27.6% in the placebo group (p = 0.03). Likelihood of remaining free of new T2 lesions was significantly greater in the atorvastatin group compared with placebo (odds ratio [OR] = 4.34, p = 0.01). Likelihood of remaining free of Gd lesions tended to be higher in the atorvastatin group (OR = 2.72, p = 0.11). Overall, atorvastatin was well tolerated. No clear antagonistic effect of atorvastatin plus IFN\u03b2-1a was observed on MRI measures.\nCONCLUSION: Atorvastatin treatment significantly decreased development of new brain MRI T2 lesion activity, although it did not achieve the composite clinical and imaging PEP.\nCLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provided Class II evidence that atorvastatin did not reduce the proportion of patients with CIS meeting imaging and clinical criteria for starting immunomodulating therapy after 12 months, compared to placebo. In an analysis of a secondary endpoint (Class III), atorvastatin was associated with a reduced risk for developing new T2 lesions.\n## Response:\nFALSE"}

We examined dually diagnosed patients' participation in MHGs and outcomes at 6, 12, and 24 months post-treatment, and the extent to which social anxiety was associated with participation. We also examined whether MHG participation and social anxiety were related to outcomes, and whether social anxiety moderated associations between participation and outcomes. We found high rates of MHG participation. Among patients who attended at least one meeting, outcomes were positive. Social anxiety was not associated with levels of MHG participation, but more participation was associated with better outcomes. When social anxiety moderated associations between MHG participation and outcomes, patients with more social anxiety benefited more from participation.

Patients (n = 495) with established basal insulin therapy but inadequate glycemic control were randomized to add lixisenatide 20 \u03bcg or placebo for 24 weeks. Basal insulin dosage was unchanged except to limit hypoglycemia. HbA1c reduction from baseline was the primary end point.\nRESULTS: Mean duration of diabetes was 12.5 years, duration of insulin use was 3.1 years, insulin dosage was 55 units/day, and baseline HbA1c was 8.4%. With lixisenatide, the placebo-corrected change of HbA1c from baseline was -0.4% (95% CI -0.6 to -0.2; P = 0.0002), and mean HbA1c at end point was 7.8%. HbA1c <7.0% (53 mmol/mol) was attained by more lixisenatide (28%) than placebo (12%; P < 0.0001) participants. Lixisenatide reduced plasma glucose levels after a standardized breakfast (placebo-corrected reduction, -3.8 mmol/L; P < 0.0001); seven-point glucose profiles showed a reduction persisting through the day. Reductions in body weight (placebo corrected, -1.3 kg; P < 0.0001) and insulin dosage (-3.7 units/day; P = 0.012) were greater with lixisenatide. Main adverse events (AEs) with lixisenatide were gastrointestinal. Symptomatic hypoglycemia was 28% for lixisenatide and 22% for placebo; 4 of 328 subjects (1.2%) had severe hypoglycemia with lixisenatide vs. 0 of 167 with placebo.\nCONCLUSIONS: By improving HbA1c and postprandial hyperglycemia without weight gain in type 2 diabetes with inadequate glycemic control despite stable basal insulin, lixisenatide may provide an alternative to rapid-acting insulin or other treatment options.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

Controlled behavioral assessment studies have not focused on this population. This study compared calorie intake, percentage of Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) per day and per kilogram, and percentage of calories from fat, protein, and carbohydrates between infants and toddlers with CF and healthy peers. Also, eating behaviors, such as meal duration, bites and sips per minute, percentage of meal spent eating, children's problematic eating behaviors, and parents' perceptions of mealtime behaviors were compared between infants and toddlers with CF and controls. Five hypotheses were tested. 1) Infants and toddlers with CF would be comparable to controls on the number of calories consumed per day and the percentage of calories from fat. 2) Infants and toddlers with CF would not meet the CF dietary guidelines for the percentage of RDA for calories or the percentage of calories from fat. 3) Infants and toddlers with CF would have longer meal durations than healthy peers, but would not differ on the pace of eating, the number of calories consumed during the meal, or the percentage of time spent eating during the meal. 4) Parents of infants and toddlers with CF would perceive more problematic mealtime behavior than controls. 5) Parents' perceptions of children's mealtime behavior would positively correlate with meal duration and negatively correlate with the number of calories consumed during the meal.\nDESIGN: A 2-group comparison study.\nSETTING/SAMPLE: A clinical sample of 35 infants and toddlers with CF (M = 18.6; standard deviation = 8.1 months; range = 7-35 months) and a community sample of 34 healthy peers matched for age, gender, socioeconomic status, and number of parents and siblings present during mealtimes.\nMEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: Children's calorie intake was measured using 3-day diet diaries. The 2 groups did not differ on the total number of calories consumed per day, the percentage of calories derived from fat, or the percentage of RDA consumed per day. Infants and toddlers with CF were not meeting the CF dietary recommendations of 120% to 150% RDA for energy with 40% of calories coming from fat. Using the Dyadic Interaction Nomenclature for Eating, a behavioral coding system, videotaped recordings of children's dinner meals were scored for meal duration, number of bites and sips per minute, number of calories per bite or sip, and the percentage of 10-second intervals with bites and sips. The CF sample had significantly longer mealtimes (20.2 minutes) than the control group (16.4 minutes), but did not differ on calories consumed at the meal, bites and sips per minute, calories per bite and sip, or time spent eating during the meal. On the Behavioral Pediatrics Feeding Assessment Scale, a measure of parental perceptions of mealtime behavior that was completed by a subset of families (39 families), parents of infants and toddlers with CF endorsed a greater number of mealtime behaviors as problems and a higher occurrence of problems than did parents of controls. Examples of these behaviors for the CF sample included problems with their child's willingness to try new foods (48%), eat vegetables (48%), and observations that their child has a poor appetite (32%) and would rather drink than eat (32%). Parents of children with CF chose a greater number of mealtime strategies and feelings as problems and reported more frequently using problematic strategies at mealtimes than did parents of controls. Examples of problematic strategies and feelings for parents of infants and toddlers with CF included feeling anxious/frustrated when feeding their children (37%), not feeling confident that their child eats enough (32%), and using coaxing to get their child to take a bite (26%). For the entire sample, a positive correlation of 0.29 was found between the number of mealtime behavior problems reported by parents and meal duration, suggesting the co-occurrence of problematic mealtime behavior with longer meal duration. No relationship was found between the number of child mealtime behavior problems reported by parents and the number of calories consumed during the filmed meal. For the CF sample, a correlation of -0.26 between children's weight percentile for age and the filmed meal duration was found, suggesting a tendency for meal duration to increase as children's weight for age decreases. Post-hoc analyses were conducted comparing infants and toddlers with previously reported samples of preschool and school-aged children on meal duration. Results demonstrated that in each group, children with CF had longer meals than age-matched controls.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal significant deficits in achieving dietary recommendations for many families of infants and toddlers with CF. Only 11% of infants and toddlers with CF met the CF dietary recommendation of at least 120% of the RDA/day for energy. In addition, infants and toddlers were found to derive only 34% of their daily calories from fat, compared with the recommended 40% needed for a moderate to high fat diet. These results underscore the need for intervention in families of infants and toddlers with CF, who in addition to being at increased risk for malnutrition, may also experience a hastening in the decline of their pulmonary status because of poor nutritional status. Currently, there is limited programmatic research on nutritional and feeding interventions for toddlers and infants with CF. One study, which used a hospital-based behavioral education program to increase the caloric intake of 3 children (ages 10-20 months) who were below the fifth percentile for weight for length, found at least a 54% increase in calories for each child after treatment. Similarly, preliminary findings of 2 parent-based interventions, a nutrition education curriculum and a nutrition education plus behavior parent-training curriculum, found a 22% and 32% increase in daily calories, respectively, at treatment completion. A large-scale clinical trial is needed to evaluate the efficacy of any nutritional intervention before widespread dissemination. Additional assessment-focused research is also needed to identify patients' who may be at greatest risk for malnutrition and to guide the development of interventions to treat them.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Baseline and Week 4\nAbstract: We performed a clinical trial to evaluate the effects of the histamine subtype-3 receptor inverse agonist MK- 0249 on cognition in AD patients. Mild-to-moderate AD patients were randomized 1:1 to 4 weeks of double-blind daily treatment with oral MK-0249 5-mg or placebo. Pharmacokinetic and PET data suggested that MK-0249 5-mg daily would achieve approximately 85% brain receptor occupancy at Cmax in elderly patients. Primary efficacy measures were the short Computerized-Neuropsychological-Test-Battery (CNTB) summary score and ADAS-Cog score. A secondary efficacy measure was a Cognition Summary Score summarizing results from 7 cognitive tests. Of 144 patients randomized, 132 completed 4 weeks (MK-0249 = 65, placebo = 67). Most patients (88.2%) were on concomitant symptomatic AD treatment. There were no significant differences between treatments on primary and secondary endpoints at week 4: short CNTB summary score = 0.89 (95% CI: -0.74,2.52); ADAS-Cog score s -0.25 (95% CI: -1.61,1.11); Cognition Summary Score = 1.38 (95% CI: -0.64,3.40). MK-0249 was generally well tolerated but was associated with an increased percentage of patients with adverse events (41/73; 56.2) versus placebo (18/70; 25.7%). Adverse events in > 5% of patients on MK-0249 were diarrhea (8.2% vs. 2.9%), headache (8.2% vs. 1.4%), muscle spasms (5.5% vs. 0%), insomnia (5.5% vs. 0%) and stomach discomfort (5.5% vs. 0%). MK-0249 5-mg once daily over 4 weeks was not effective in improving cognitive function in mild to moderate AD patients who were on concomitant symptomatic AD treatment.

We evaluated drug concentrations among men who have sex with men in a substudy of the iPrEx trial (1). In this randomized placebo-controlled trial, daily oral doses of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate were used as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in men who have sex with men. Drug was detected less frequently in blood plasma and in viable cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in HIV-infected cases at the visit when HIV was first discovered compared with controls at the matched time point of the study (8% versus 44%; P < 0.001) and in the 90 days before that visit (11% versus 51%; P < 0.001). An intracellular concentration of the active form of tenofovir, tenofovir-diphosphate (TFV-DP), of 16 fmol per million PBMCs was associated with a 90% reduction in HIV acquisition relative to the placebo arm. Directly observed dosing in a separate study, the STRAND trial, yielded TFV-DP concentrations that, when analyzed according to the iPrEx model, corresponded to an HIV-1 risk reduction of 76% for two doses per week, 96% for four doses per week, and 99% for seven doses per week. Prophylactic benefits were observed over a range of doses and drug concentrations, suggesting ways to optimize PrEP regimens for this population.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Although evidence suggests that family psychoeducation is cost-effective, many cost-effectiveness analyses have suffered from limitations that reduce their utility in guiding decisions to incorporate this intervention within existing clinical services. These include not presenting results in present-day dollars and not examining whether the intervention would remain cost-effective in situations where the clinical benefits achieved were smaller than those reported in past studies. Thus the goal of this study was to investigate the cost of providing a specific psychoeducation program-multifamily group psychoeducation-to individuals with first-episode psychosis and their families.\nMETHODS: Statistical simulation was used to estimate the cost and burden of illness associated with usual treatment versus usual treatment plus multifamily group psychoeducation. In addition, the simulation model was rerun to test whether multifamily psychoeducation would remain cost-effective in situations where the clinical benefits achieved were smaller than those reported in past studies.\nRESULTS: When provided for two years, multifamily group psychoeducation ranged from a cost-effective to a cost-saving intervention, depending on the clinical benefits achieved by staff delivering the intervention. When provided for longer durations (five, ten, or 20 years), multifamily psychoeducation was a cost-saving intervention even in scenarios where the clinical benefits of the intervention were reduced by 90%.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that multifamily group psychoeducation may not only be a cost-effective intervention for first-episode psychosis but may often be a cost-saving intervention.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Because deficient Wnt signaling has been implicated in disorders of reduced bone mass, we tested whether lithium could improve bone mass in mice. We gavage-fed lithium chloride to 8-week-old mice from three different strains (Lrp5(-/-), SAMP6, and C57BL/6) and assessed the effect on bone metabolism after 4 weeks of therapy. Lrp5(-/-) mice lack the Wnt coreceptor low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 and have markedly reduced bone mass. Lithium, which is predicted to act downstream of this receptor, restored bone metabolism and bone mass to near wild-type levels in these mice. SAMP6 mice have accelerated osteoporosis due to inadequate osteoblast renewal. Lithium significantly improved bone mass in these mice and in wild-type C57BL/6 mice. We found that lithium activated canonical Wnt signaling in cultured calvarial osteoblasts from Lrp5(-/-) mice ex vivo and that lithium-treated mice had increased expression of Wnt-responsive genes in their bone marrow cells in vivo. These data lead us to conclude that lithium enhances bone formation and improves bone mass in mice and that it may do so via activation of the canonical Wnt pathway. Lithium has been used safely and effectively for over half a century in the treatment of bipolar illness. Prospective studies in patients receiving lithium should determine whether it also improves bone mass in humans.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

The randomised, phase III JAVELIN Gastric 300 trial compared avelumab versus physician's choice of chemotherapy as third-line therapy in patients with advanced GC/GEJC.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with unresectable, recurrent, locally advanced, or metastatic GC/GEJC were recruited at 147 sites globally. All patients were randomised to receive either avelumab 10\u2009mg/kg by intravenous infusion every 2\u2009weeks or physician's choice of chemotherapy (paclitaxel 80\u2009mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 or irinotecan 150\u2009mg/m2 on days 1 and 15, each of a 4-week treatment cycle); patients ineligible for chemotherapy received best supportive care. The primary end point was overall survival (OS). Secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety.\nRESULTS: A total of 371 patients were randomised. The trial did not meet its primary end point of improving OS {median, 4.6 versus 5.0\u2009months; hazard ratio (HR)=1.1 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.9-1.4]; P\u2009=\u20090.81} or the secondary end points of PFS [median, 1.4 versus 2.7\u2009months; HR=1.73 (95% CI 1.4-2.2); P\u2009>\u20090.99] or ORR (2.2% versus 4.3%) in the avelumab versus chemotherapy arms, respectively. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) of any grade occurred in 90 patients (48.9%) and 131 patients (74.0%) in the avelumab and chemotherapy arms, respectively. Grade \u22653 TRAEs occurred in 17 patients (9.2%) in the avelumab arm and in 56 patients (31.6%) in the chemotherapy arm.\nCONCLUSIONS: Treatment of patients with GC/GEJC with single-agent avelumab in the third-line setting did not result in an improvement in OS or PFS compared with chemotherapy. Avelumab showed a more manageable safety profile than chemotherapy.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02625623.\n## Response:\nFALSE"}

Off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery is thought to avoid this deleterious effect of pump use on platelets. However, the influence of off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery on platelets has not been thoroughly studied.\nMETHODS: Accordingly, we evaluated 60 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting prospectively using cardiopulmonary bypass and warm cardioplegic arrest (n = 30) or an off-pump technique (n = 30). Platelet function was evaluated before and 2 hours after coronary artery bypass grafting.\nRESULTS: Among patients undergoing on-pump coronary artery bypass surgery, all studies of platelet function were significantly abnormal after surgical intervention compared with results before surgical intervention. Similarly, among patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery, evidence of platelet dysfunction after surgical intervention was noted, with a lower platelet count and a higher proportion of P-selectin- and Annexin V-positive platelets. However, compared with the preprocedural value, the postprocedural decrease in platelet count (78,200 x 10(3)/microL vs 103,000 x 10(3)/microL) and platelet aggregation (0.8% vs 10.9%) and increase in bleeding time (0 minutes vs +1.3 minutes), P-selectin-positive platelets (6.0% vs 9.1%), and Annexin V-positive platelets (1.7% vs 3.7%) were significantly lower in the off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery group compared with those in the on-pump coronary artery bypass surgery group, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: Early postoperative decrease in platelet count and increase in platelet activation occurs to a much lesser extent and does not alter bleeding time or adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery. This lack of significant effects on platelets might in part account for the potential decreased risk in bleeding and for the preserved hemostasis seen in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery compared with those undergoing on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting surgery.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

This trial was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of sorafenib versus placebo as adjuvant therapy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma after surgical resection or local ablation.\nMETHODS: We undertook this phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with a complete radiological response after surgical resection (n=900) or local ablation (n=214) in 202 sites (hospitals and research centres) in 28 countries. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 400 mg oral sorafenib or placebo twice a day, for a maximum of 4 years, according to a block randomisation scheme (block size of four) using an interactive voice-response system. Patients were stratified by curative treatment, geography, Child-Pugh status, and recurrence risk. The primary outcome was recurrence-free survival assessed after database cut-off on Nov 29, 2013. We analysed efficacy in the intention-to-treat population and safety in randomly assigned patients receiving at least one study dose. The final analysis is reported. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00692770.\nFINDINGS: We screened 1602 patients between Aug 15, 2008, and Nov 17, 2010, and randomly assigned 1114 patients. Of 556 patients in the sorafenib group, 553 (>99%) received the study treatment and 471 (85%) terminated treatment. Of 558 patients in the placebo group, 554 (99%) received the study treatment and 447 (80%) terminated treatment. Median duration of treatment and mean daily dose were 12\u00b75 months (IQR 2\u00b76-35\u00b78) and 577 mg per day (SD 212\u00b78) for sorafenib, compared with 22\u00b72 months (8\u00b71-38\u00b78) and 778\u00b70 mg per day (79\u00b78) for placebo. Dose modification was reported for 497 (89%) of 559 patients in the sorafenib group and 206 (38%) of 548 patients in the placebo group. At final analysis, 464 recurrence-free survival events had occurred (270 in the placebo group and 194 in the sorafenib group). Median follow-up for recurrence-free survival was 8\u00b75 months (IQR 2\u00b79-19\u00b75) in the sorafenib group and 8\u00b74 months (2\u00b79-19\u00b78) in the placebo group. We noted no difference in median recurrence-free survival between the two groups (33\u00b73 months in the sorafenib group vs 33\u00b77 months in the placebo group; hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b7940; 95% CI 0\u00b7780-1\u00b7134; one-sided p=0\u00b726). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were hand-foot skin reaction (154 [28%] of 559 patients in the sorafenib group vs four [<1%] of 548 patients in the placebo group) and diarrhoea (36 [6%] vs five [<1%] in the placebo group). Sorafenib-related serious adverse events included hand-foot skin reaction (ten [2%]), abnormal hepatic function (four [<1%]), and fatigue (three [<1%]). There were four (<1%) drug-related deaths in the sorafenib group and two (<1%) in the placebo group.\nINTERPRETATION: Our data indicate that sorafenib is not an effective intervention in the adjuvant setting for hepatocellular carcinoma following resection or ablation.\n## Response:\nFALSE"}

Diabetes in particular is of concern because of its increased prevalence among Navajo youth. Gardening can successfully address issues of poor availability of fruits and vegetables and offer many other social and health benefits. Our assessment aimed to determine Navajo attitudes about gardening and health in San Juan County, New Mexico. We conducted seven focus groups (including 31 people) to assess knowledge and attitudes related to gardening and uncover barriers and facilitators to participation in a garden project. Each group session was moderated by two Navajo students. Transcripts revealed that many Navajo are aware of adverse health issues that occur on the reservation, predominantly obesity and diabetes. Participants expressed a preference for educational approaches that incorporated cultural traditions, respect for elders, use of visual aids, and experiential learning. Several social and agronomic barriers to gardening were also mentioned. Results suggested a broad interest in promoting gardening especially to reduce the risk of diabetes with the added value of enhancing social capital in Navajo communities.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

We conducted a pilot study of metformin, a medication efficacious in treating and preventing diabetes while reducing hyperinsulinemia, among persons with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) with the goal of collecting preliminary data on feasibility, safety, and efficacy. Participants were 80 men and women aged 55 to 90 years with aMCI, overweight or obese, without treated diabetes. We randomized participants to metformin 1000\u200amg twice a day or matching placebo for 12 months. The co-primary clinical outcomes were changes from baseline to 12 months in total recall of the Selective Reminding Test (SRT) and the score of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog). The secondary outcome was change in relative glucose uptake in the posterior cingulate-precuneus in brain fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. Change in plasma A\u03b242 was an exploratory outcome. The mean age of participants was 65 years. Fifty percent of participants were women. The only baseline variable that was different between the arms was the ADAS-Cog. Metformin could not be tolerated by 7.5% of participants; 15% tolerated 500\u200amg/day, 35% tolerated 1000\u200amg/day, 32.5% tolerated 1500\u200amg/day, and only 10% tolerated the maximum dose. There were no serious adverse events related to metformin. The 7.5% of persons who did not tolerate metformin reported gastrointestinal symptoms. After adjusting for baseline ADAS-cog, changes in total recall of the SRT favored the metformin group (9.7\u00b18.5 versus 5.3\u00b18.5; p\u200a=\u200a0.02). Differences for other outcomes were not significant. A larger trial seems warranted to evaluate the efficacy and cognitive safety of metformin in prodromal AD.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

Consistent with the Institute of Medicine's (IOM) emphasis on patients transitioning from treatment to cancer survivorship and increasing long-term healthy behaviors in these survivors, we plan to conduct a pilot RCT to address the increasing overweight/obesity rates among PCS by targeting their caregivers as agents for PCS behavior change. We plan to focus on parents' behaviors, attitudes and roles in promoting healthier eating and physical activity (PA) in PCS and adapt an evidence-informed, manualized parent intervention - NOURISH - found to be effective for parents of overweight and obese children and adolescents in reducing child and adolescent BMI. We plan to adapt NOURISH for caregivers of 5-12 year old PCS (6 months-4 years off active cancer treatment). Our pilot feasibility RCT - NOURISH-T (Nourishing Our Understanding of Role modeling to Improve Support for Healthy Transitions) evaluates: 1) the preliminary efficacy of NOURISH-T for PCS, compared with an Enhanced Usual Care (EUC) control condition, and 2) factors to consider to improve future adaptations of the intervention. The project will enroll caregivers of PCS at two pediatric oncology clinics into the 6-week intervention (or EUC) with assessments occurring pre- and post-6 weeks of intervention, and at a 4-month follow-up.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

This study evaluated whether entry to a therapeutic workplace could reinforce adherence with oral naltrexone. Opiate-dependent and cocaine-using injection drug users were detoxified, inducted onto oral naltrexone, and randomly assigned to a contingency (n = 35) or prescription (n = 32) group for a 26-week period. Contingency participants were required to ingest naltrexone under staff observation to gain access to the therapeutic workplace. Prescription participants received a take-home supply of naltrexone and could access the workplace independent of naltrexone ingestion. Primary outcome measures were percent of urine samples positive for naltrexone at 30-day assessments and negative for opiates and cocaine at 30-day assessments. Contingency participants provided significantly more urine samples that were positive for naltrexone compared with prescription participants (72% vs. 21%, p < .01); however, no effect of experimental group was observed on percent opiate-negative (71% vs. 60%, p = .19.) or cocaine-negative (56% vs. 53%, p = .82) samples in the contingency and prescription groups, respectively. Opiate-positive samples were significantly more likely to occur in conjunction with cocaine (p < .001) and when not protected by naltrexone (p < .02), independent of experimental group. Overall, these results show that contingent access to a therapeutic workplace significantly promoted adherence to oral naltrexone, and that the majority of opiate use occurred in conjunction with cocaine use, suggesting that untreated cocaine use may limit the effectiveness of oral naltrexone in promoting opiate abstinence.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

A total of 793 participants (BMI = 36.5 \u00b1 4.2 kg/m\u00b2) was randomly assigned in a 1:3 ratio to: (i) placebo + BMOD (N = 202); or (ii) naltrexone sustained-release (SR, 32 mg/day), combined with bupropion SR (360 mg/day) plus BMOD (i.e., NB32 + BMOD; N = 591). Both groups were prescribed an energy-reduced diet and 28 group BMOD sessions. Co-primary end points were percentage change in weight and the proportion of participants who lost \u22655% weight at week 56. Efficacy analyses were performed on a modified intent-to-treat population (ITT; i.e., participants with \u22651 postbaseline weight while taking study drug (placebo + BMOD, N = 193; NB32 + BMOD, N = 482)). Missing data were replaced with the last observation obtained on study drug. At week 56, weight loss was 5.1 \u00b1 0.6% with placebo + BMOD vs. 9.3 \u00b1 0.4% with NB32 + BMOD (P < 0.001). A completers analysis revealed weight losses of 7.3 \u00b1 0.9% (N = 106) vs. 11.5 \u00b1 0.6% (N = 301), respectively (P < 0.001). A third analysis, which included all randomized participants, yielded losses of 4.9 \u00b1 0.6 vs. 7.8 \u00b1 0.4%, respectively (P < 0.001). Significantly more NB32 + BMOD- vs. placebo + BMOD-treated participants lost \u22655 and \u226510% of initial weight, and the former had significantly greater improvements in markers of cardiometabolic disease risk. NB32 + BMOD was generally well tolerated, although associated with more reports of nausea than placebo + BMOD. The present findings support the efficacy of combined naltrexone/bupropion therapy as an adjunct to intensive BMOD for obesity.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

The study capped the proportion of randomised patients on insulin plus metformin at 75%. Further, the study capped the proportion of randomised patients on premixed insulin at 25%. The metformin dose and the insulin dose were to remain stable throughout the study. The primary endpoint was HbA1c change from baseline at week 24.\nRESULTS: Mean baseline characteristics were similar between the sitagliptin (n = 322) and placebo (n = 319) groups, including HbA1c (8.7 vs. 8.6%), diabetes duration (13 vs. 12 years), body mass index (31.4 vs. 31.4 kg/m(2)), and total daily insulin dose (51 vs. 52 IU), respectively. At 24 weeks, the addition of sitagliptin significantly (p < 0.001) reduced HbA1c by 0.6% compared with placebo (0.0%). A greater proportion of patients achieved an HbA1c level < 7% while randomised to sitagliptin as compared with placebo (13 vs. 5% respectively; p < 0.001). Similar HbA1c reductions were observed in the patient strata defined by insulin type (long-acting and intermediate-acting insulins or premixed insulins) and by baseline metformin treatment. The addition of sitagliptin significantly (p < 0.001) reduced fasting plasma glucose by 15.0 mg/dl (0.8 mmol/l) and 2-h postmeal glucose by 36.1 mg/dl (2.0 mmol/l) relative to placebo. A higher incidence of adverse experiences was reported with sitagliptin (52%) compared with placebo (43%), due mainly to the increased incidence of hypoglycaemia (sitagliptin, 16% vs. placebo, 8%). The number of hypoglycaemic events meeting the protocol-specified criteria for severity was low with sitagliptin (n = 2) and placebo (n = 1). No significant change from baseline in body weight was observed in either group.\nCONCLUSION: In this 24-week study, the addition of sitagliptin to ongoing, stable-dose insulin therapy with or without concomitant metformin improved glycaemic control and was generally well tolerated in patients with type 2 diabetes.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

In this paper, we present results from an analysis of existing data about the demographic and clinical characteristics, service needs and utilization patterns, and primary care retention of HIV-positive primary care patients seen at FCHC during a 24-month study period. Patient data were extracted from Logician, FCHC's electronic medical record system, and imported into Microsoft Access, Microsoft Excel and SAS for manipulation and analysis. A total of 999 unique individuals were included in the study population. Most were men (97%), white (75%) and between 39 and 80 years of age. Patients averaged 6.7 medical visits annually at FCHC, and 61% had at least one medical visit every six months. Significant predictors of primary care utilization were insurance status, HIV disease stage, being on combination therapy, first CD4 count, first viral load level and receipt of ancillary services. Need and receipt of ancillary services were found through medical and case management record review; case management was the most used ancillary service, received by 36% of the study population. For most ancillary services, clients with assessed need had documented receipt of the service. Publicly insured and/or Ryan White CARE Act-funded patients had the greatest ancillary service utilization. The influence of ancillary services upon primary care entry could not be evaluated with available data; however, their influence upon primary care was significant. For patients who received primary care in every continuous six-month period, statistically significant associations were found with receipt of mental health care, case management, drug assistance, food/nutrition, complementary services and housing. Using the more rigorous FCHC standard of care (minimum of four primary care visits per year), significant associations were also found with transportation, legal services and substance abuse treatment. For non-whites and women, mental health care, food/nutrition, housing and transportation had particular significance.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

One Year\nAbstract: Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is highly prevalent among adolescents enrolled in behavioral health services but remains undertreated in this age group. Also the first-line treatment for adolescent ADHD, stimulant medication, is underutilized in routine practice. This article briefly describes three behavioral interventions designed to promote stronger integration of medication interventions into treatment planning for adolescent ADHD: family ADHD psychoeducation, family-based medication decision-making, and behavior therapist leadership in coordinating medication integration. It then introduces the Medication Integration Protocol (MIP), which incorporates all three interventions into a five-task protocol: ADHD Assessment and Medication Consult; ADHD Psychoeducation and Client Acceptance; ADHD Symptoms and Family Relations; ADHD Medication and Family Decision-Making; and Medication Management and Integration Planning. The article concludes by highlighting what behavior therapists should know about best practices for medication integration across diverse settings and populations: integrating medication interventions into primary care, managing medication priorities and polypharmacy issues for adolescents with multiple diagnoses, providing ADHD medications to adolescent substance users, and the compatibility of MIP intervention strategies with everyday practice conditions.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Laboratory tests included hematocrit (Hct), prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time (PTT), platelet count, fibrinogen concentration, and thromboelastography. Stepwise linear regression analysis indicated that platelet count during CPB was the variable most significantly associated with intraoperative blood loss (in milliliters per kilogram) and 12-hour chest tube output (in milliliters per kilogram). Other independent variables associated with blood loss were thromboelastography maximum amplitude (MA) during CPB, preoperative PTT, preoperative Hct, and preoperative thromboelastography angle and shear modulus values. Thromboelastography MA during CPB was the only variable associated with total products transfused (in milliliters per kilogram). Of all tests studied, platelet count during CPB (< or = 108,000/microL) provided the maximum sensitivity (83%) and specificity (58%) for prediction of excessive blood loss (receiver operating characteristic analysis). Blood loss was inversely related to patient age; neonates received the most donor units (median, 8 units; range, 6 to 10 units).\nCONCLUSIONS: During cardiac surgery, coagulation tests (including thromboelastography) drawn pre-CPB and during CPB are useful to identify children at risk for excessive bleeding. Platelet count during CPB was the variable most significantly associated with blood loss.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

We used transcranial Doppler to compare cerebral blood flow velocity changes (Vmca) during recovery after anesthesia. In the first part of the study, 30 patients were randomized to propofol- or isoflurane-based anesthesia. Vmca, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and CO(2) partial pressure (PaCO(2)) were measured before anesthesia, at tracheal extubation, at 5 to 60 min after extubation, and at 24 h after anesthesia. There was a 60% increase in Vmca above the awake value at extubation. The increase in Vmca was significant at least for 30 min after extubation. There was no difference between the Propofol and Isoflurane anesthesia groups. There was no correlation between Vmca and MAP or PaCO(2) at any time. In the second part of the study, Vmca, MAP, and jugular venous bulb saturation in oxygen (SjvO(2)) were measured after isoflurane anesthesia. SjvO(2) increased significantly at extubation, consistent with cerebral hyperemia. In conclusion, cerebral hyperemia occurs during recovery from general anesthesia independently of the anesthetic technique or hemodynamic or ventilatory changes. It is speculated that cerebral hyperemia is a nonspecific response to stress during emergence from anesthesia.\nIMPLICATIONS: Cerebral hyperemia occurs during emergence from general anesthesia. It might be one mechanism of cerebral complications in the early postoperative period.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

Aflibercept is a recombinant human fusion protein that binds A and B isoforms of VEGF and placental growth factor, thereby inhibiting angiogenesis. We assessed whether the addition of aflibercept to docetaxel and prednisone would improve overall survival in men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer compared with the addition of placebo to docetaxel and prednisone.\nMETHODS: VENICE was a phase 3, multicentre, randomised double-blind placebo-controlled parallel group study done in 31 countries (187 sites). Men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, adequate organ function, and no prior chemotherapy were treated with docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) intravenously every 3 weeks) and oral prednisone (5 mg twice daily) and randomly allocated (1:1) to receive aflibercept (6 mg/kg) or placebo, intravenously, every 3 weeks. Treatment allocation was done centrally via an interactive voice response system, using a computer-generated sequence with a permuted-block size of four and stratified according Eastern Co-operative Group performance status (0-1 vs 2). Patients, investigators, and other individuals responsible for study conduct and data analysis were masked to treatment assignment. Aflibercept or placebo vials were supplied in identical boxes. The primary endpoint was overall survival using intention-to-treat analysis. This is the primary analysis of the completed trial. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00519285 FINDINGS: Between Aug 17, 2007, and Feb 11, 2010, 1224 men were randomly allocated to treatment: 612 to each group. At final analysis, median follow-up was 35 months (IQR 29-41) and 873 men had died. Median overall survival was 22\u00b71 months (95\u00b76% CI 20\u00b73-24\u00b71) in the aflibercept group and 21\u00b72 months (19\u00b76-23\u00b78) in the placebo group (stratified hazard ratio 0\u00b794, 95\u00b76% CI 0\u00b782-1\u00b708; p=0\u00b738). We recorded a higher incidence of grade 3-4 gastrointestinal disorders (182 [30%] vs 48 [8\u00b70%]), haemorrhagic events (32 [5\u00b72%] vs ten [1\u00b77%]), hypertension (81 [13%] vs 20 [3\u00b73%]), fatigue (97 [16%] vs 46 [7\u00b77%]), infections (123 [20%] vs 60 [10%]) and treatment-related fatal adverse events (21 [3\u00b74%] vs nine [1\u00b75%]) in the aflibercept group than in the placebo group.\nINTERPRETATION: Aflibercept in combination with docetaxel and prednisone given as first-line chemotherapy for men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer resulted in no improvement in overall survival and added toxicity compared with placebo. Docetaxel plus prednisone remains the standard treatment for such men who need first-line chemotherapy.\nFUNDING: Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.\n## Response:\nFALSE"}

This study investigated whether cigarette demand predicted response to contingent monetary rewards for abstinence among individuals with substance use disorders. It also sought to replicate evidence for greater price sensitivity at whole-dollar pack price transitions (ie, left-digit effects).\nMETHODS: Participants (N = 338) were individuals in residential substance use disorder treatment who participated in a randomized controlled trial that compared contingent vouchers to noncontingent vouchers for smoking abstinence. Baseline demand indices were used to predict number of abstinent days during the 14-day voucher period (after the reduction lead-in) and at 1 and 3 months afterward.\nRESULTS: Demand indices correlated with measures of smoking and nicotine dependence. As measured by elasticity, intensity and O max, higher demand significantly predicted fewer abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings during voucher period for individuals in the noncontingent vouchers condition. Breakpoint exhibited a trend-level association with abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings. Demand indices did not predict abstinence in the contingent vouchers group, and did not predict abstinence at 1- and 3-month follow-ups. Left-digit price transitions were associated with significantly greater reductions in consumption.\nCONCLUSIONS: The association of cigarette demand with smoking behavior only in the group for whom abstinence was not incentivized indicates that CPT assesses the value of smoking more than the value of money per se and that vouchers counteract the effects of the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes. Results provide initial short-term evidence of predictive validity for the CPT indices.\nIMPLICATIONS: This study provides the first evidence of the validity of the CPT for predicting early response to brief advice for smoking cessation plus nicotine replacement in smokers with substance dependence. However, demand for cigarettes did not predict voucher-based treatment response, indicating that incentives serve as a powerful motivator not to smoke that acts in opposition to the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes and that the indices reflect the value of smoking more than the value of money per se.\n## Response:\nFALSE"}

The primary efficacy end point was change from baseline Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total score at week 3. Secondary outcomes included YMRS response and remission and Clinical Global Impression for Bipolar Disorder and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score changes. Patients completing the core study were eligible for a 40-week double-blind extension assessing safety and tolerability. Adjunctive asenapine significantly improved mania versus placebo at week 3 (primary end point) and weeks 2 to 12. The YMRS response rates were similar at week 3 but significantly better with asenapine at week 12. The YMRS remission rates and changes from baseline on Clinical Global Impression for Bipolar Disorder for mania and overall illness were significantly better with asenapine at weeks 3 and 12. No other statistically significant differences on secondary outcomes were observed. Only a small number of patients entered the extension, making firm statistical conclusions on efficacy difficult. Treatment-emergent adverse events reported by 5% or more of asenapine patients and at twice the incidence of placebo were sedation, somnolence, depression/depressive symptoms, oral hypoesthesia, and increased weight in the 12-week core study. Adjunctive asenapine to lithium or valproate was more effective than mood stabilizer monotherapy in the core study and was well tolerated for up to 52 weeks.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

No effective pharmacologic treatment is available for both disorders to date.\nMETHODS: In a phase 2, double-blind study, patients with schizophrenia and AUD experiencing \u2265 10 drinking and \u2265 2 heavy-drinking days in the previous month and recent (\u2264 6 mo) disease symptom exacerbation were recruited between June 2014 and March 2017. DSM-IV-TR and DSM-5 criteria were used to assign the diagnoses of schizophrenia and AUD, respectively. After a 6-week lead-in period, 234 eligible patients were randomized (1:1) to olanzapine + 10 mg samidorphan tablets (OLZ/SAM) or olanzapine + placebo tablets (olanzapine) for 36-60 weeks of treatment. The primary outcome of time to the first event of exacerbation of disease symptoms (EEDS) was evaluated using the log rank test for treatment comparison, and the Cox proportional-hazards model was used to estimate hazard ratio. Safety was assessed as adverse events and laboratory measures.\nRESULTS: No significant difference was observed between groups in the time to first EEDS (hazard ratio = 0.91; 95% CI, 0.53-1.56; P = .746). Patients treated with OLZ/SAM vs olanzapine had numerically lower rates in 6 of 8 criteria to evaluate EEDS. Change from baseline in percentage of heavy-drinking days during the double-blind treatment period was similar in OLZ/SAM- vs olanzapine-treated patients. OLZ/SAM was generally well tolerated with a safety profile similar to olanzapine.\nCONCLUSIONS: OLZ/SAM was not superior to olanzapine in the time to EEDS and was well tolerated in patients with schizophrenia and AUD. Further research is needed to identify effective treatments for this difficult-to-treat population.\nTRIAL REGISTRATIONS: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02161718; EudraCT number: 2014-001211-39 \u200b.\n## Response:\nFALSE"}

Since the phase-out of chlorofluorocarbon nasal aerosols, intranasal corticosteroids have been available only as aqueous nasal sprays. This study was designed to assess the efficacy, safety, and quality-of-life benefits of beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) hydrofluoroalkane nasal aerosol in subjects with perennial AR (PAR). After a 7- to 21-day placebo run-in period, eligible subjects aged \u226512 years with PAR were randomized to 6 weeks of once-daily treatment with BDP nasal aerosol at 320 \u03bcg or placebo. Reflective and instantaneous total nasal symptom scores (rTNSS and iTNSS, respectively), Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) score, and physician-assessed total nasal symptom score were evaluated. The primary end point was change from baseline in average morning (A.M.) and evening (P.M.) subject-reported rTNSS over the 6-week treatment period. Safety and tolerability were also assessed. Treatment with BDP nasal aerosol showed significantly greater improvement in average A.M. and P.M. rTNSS compared with placebo (mean treatment difference, -0.84; 95% confidence interval, -1.2, -0.5; p < 0.001). Greater improvements in rTNSS were reported as early as day 1 and were maintained throughout the 6-week treatment period with the exception of day 2. Greater improvements were seen for all four individual nasal symptoms (nasal congestion, nasal itching, rhinorrhea, and sneezing) with BDP nasal aerosol compared with placebo. Similarly, significant improvements were seen in average A.M. and P.M. iTNSS (p < 0.001) and RQLQ score (p = 0.001) with BDP nasal aerosol compared with placebo. In addition, BDP nasal aerosol treatment was well tolerated, and its safety profile was comparable to that of placebo. This clinical study indicated that treatment with BDP nasal aerosol provides statistically significant and clinically meaningful nasal symptom relief accompanied by improved quality of life in subjects with PAR. Additionally, treatment with BDP nasal aerosol was well tolerated with a safety profile comparable to that of placebo.

Intervention was video DOT using a HIPAA-compliant smartphone application to record taking daily buprenorphine. Study smartphones, text reminders to upload a video, and calendar summaries of video DOT adherence were provided. Main outcomes were 1) percentage of 12 weekly urine drug tests (UDT) negative for illicit opioids and 2) engagement in treatment at week 12 (i.e., having an active prescription for buprenorphine within the last 7 days).\nRESULTS: Of 78 enrolled, 20 (26 %) were female; 29 (37 %) non-white; and 31 (40 %) homeless. The mean (standard deviation) percentage of doses confirmed by video was 31 % (34 %). In intention-to-treat analysis, the average percentage of weekly opioid negative UDT was 50 % (95 % CI: 40-63 %) in the intervention arm versus 64 % (95 % CI: 55-74 %) among controls; RR = 0.78 (95 % CI: 0.60-1.02, p = 0.07).

The aim of this study was to determine the demographic, clinical, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) factors associated with QOL 10 years after CIS.\nMETHODS: Controlled High Risk Avonex\u00ae Multiple Sclerosis Prevention Study in Ongoing Neurologic Surveillance (CHAMPIONS) 10-year patients were assessed for CDMS, EDSS score, MRI T2 activity, brain parenchymal fraction, and patient-reported QOL. Associations were evaluated using analysis of variance models.\nRESULTS: A second clinical event consistent with CDMS and higher EDSS scores at years 5 and 10 were associated with lower 36-item Short Form Health Status Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Summary scores at year 10 (P < .01). Patients with earlier onset of CDMS had worse patient-reported Physical Component Summary, SF-36 Mental Component Summary, fatigue, and pain scores at year 10 than patients with later or no onset of CDMS. Neither initial randomization group nor any MRI metrics assessed at baseline or during follow-up were associated with QOL at 10 years.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results support the development of therapies for patients with CIS that significantly reduce the risk of conversion to CDMS and the progression of physical disability to milestones as low as EDSS scores of 2.0.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

From January 2000 until May 2005, 93 patients with anorexia nervosa received intensive inpatient or day-program treatment at the New York State Psychiatric Institute or Toronto General Hospital. Participants regained weight to a minimum body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters) of 19.0 and were then eligible to participate in the randomized phase of the trial.\nINTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned to receive fluoxetine or placebo and were treated for up to 1 year as outpatients in double-blind fashion. All patients also received individual cognitive behavioral therapy.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measures were time-to-relapse and the proportion of patients successfully completing 1 year of treatment.\nRESULTS: Forty-nine patients were assigned to fluoxetine and 44 to placebo. Similar percentages of patients assigned to fluoxetine and to placebo maintained a body mass index of at least 18.5 and remained in the study for 52 weeks (fluoxetine, 26.5%; placebo, 31.5%; P = .57).

The primary outcome was the change from baseline to cycle 6 for all indices.\nRESULTS: All parameters were similar at baseline between the two groups. Over six cycles, NOMAC/E2 had less effect on most haemostatic indices than LNG/EE. Lipids were essentially unchanged with NOMAC/E2, whereas with LNG/EE high-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides slightly increased. NOMAC/E2 induced negligible changes in glucose and insulin parameters, in contrast to LNG/EE. A much smaller increase in CRP was observed with NOMAC/E2 than with LNG/EE. NOMAC/E2 was associated with a greater increase in SHBG.\nCONCLUSIONS: The monophasic COC NOMAC/E2 had less influence on haemostasis, lipids and carbohydrate metabolism than the COC LNG/EE.\n## Response:\nTRUE"}

Logistic regression analyses of 2007 data generated 4 independent models per outcome (HCV- or HBV-related deaths) that each included 1 of 4 comorbid conditions and all sociodemographic characteristics.\nRESULTS: Between 1999 and 2007, recorded deaths from HCV [corrected] increased significantly to 15,106, whereas deaths from HIV declined to 12,734 by 2007. Factors associated with HCV-related deaths included chronic liver disease, HBV co-infection, alcohol-related conditions, minority status, and HIV co-infection. Factors that increased odds of HBV-related death included chronic liver disease, HCV co-infection, Asian or Pacific Islander descent, HIV co-infection, and alcohol-related conditions. Most deaths from HBV and HCV occurred in middle-aged persons.\nLIMITATION: A person other than the primary physician of the decedent frequently completed the death certificate, and HCV and HBV often were not detected and thus not reported as causes of death.\nCONCLUSION: By 2007, HCV had superseded HIV as a cause of death in the United States, and deaths from HCV and HBV disproportionately occurred in middle-aged persons. To achieve decreases in mortality similar to those seen with HIV requires new policy initiatives to detect patients with chronic hepatitis and link them to care and treatment.\nPRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n## Response:\nNONE"}

It was hypothesized that vecuronium impairs carotid body chemoreceptor function during hypoxia.\nMETHOD: The effect of systemic administration of vecuronium on single chemoreceptor activity during hypoxia, as recorded from a single nerve fiber preparation of the carotid sinus nerve, was studied in seven mechanically ventilated New Zealand White rabbits during continuous thiopental anesthesia. During normoventilation, the isocapnic hypoxic chemosensitivity of the single carotid body chemoreceptor was measured at four levels of oxygenation; these measurements were repeated at six separate occasions: control recording before injection, after intravenous administrations of 0.1 mg and 0.5 mg of vecuronium, and then at three occasions during a 90-min recovery period. Chemoreceptor chemosensitivity during isocapnic hypoxia was expressed as a hyperbolic function: Chemoreceptor output (Hz) = a + b x PaO2(-1) (mmHg).\nRESULTS: Chemosensitivity was reduced after both 0.1 mg and 0.5 mg vecuronium intravenous administration compared with control measurements; the hypoxic response curve was significantly depressed after both doses (P < 0.05). Notably, there was variation in the effect of vecuronium; some chemoreceptor preparations showed only minimal impairment, whereas some showed an almost abolished response to hypoxia. The chemosensitivity remained significantly depressed at 30 and 60 min but had recovered spontaneously at 90 min after 0.5 mg vecuronium.\nDISCUSSION: It is concluded that vecuronium depresses carotid body chemoreceptor function to a varying extent during hypoxia and that the depression recovers spontaneously.\n## Response:\nNONE"}
