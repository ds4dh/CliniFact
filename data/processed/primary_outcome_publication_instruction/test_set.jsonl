Previous studies have reported significant decreases in the levels of serotonin (5-HT) and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the brains of the R6/2 transgenic mouse model of HD. In an attempt to elucidate the cause of these neurochemical perturbations in HD, the protein levels and enzymatic activity of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), the rate-limiting enzyme in 5-HT biosynthesis, were determined. Enzyme activity was measured in brainstem homogenates from 4-, 8-, and 12-week-old R6/2 mice and compared with aged-matched wild-type control mice. We observed a 62% decrease in brainstem TPH activity (p = 0.009) in 4-week-old R6/2 mice, well before the onset of behavioral symptoms. In addition, significant decreases in TPH activity were also observed at 8 and 12 weeks of age (61%, p = 0.02 and 86%, p = 0.005, respectively). In the 12-week-old-mice, no change in immunoreactive TPH was observed. In vitro binding showed that TPH does not bind to exon 1 of huntingtin in a polyglutamine-dependent manner. Specifically, glutathione-S-transferase huntingtin exon 1 proteins with 20, 32 or 53 polyglutamines did not interact with radiolabeled tryptophan hydroxylase. Therefore, the inhibition of TPH activity does not appear to result from a direct huntingtin/TPH interaction. Receptor binding analyses for the 5-HT1A receptor in 12-week-old R6/2 mice revealed significant reductions in 8-OH-[3H]DPAT binding in several hippocampal and cortical regions. These results demonstrate that the serotonergic system in the R6/2 mice is severely disrupted in both presymptomatic and symptomatic mice. The presymptomatic inhibition of TPH activity in the R6/2 mice may help explain the functional consequences of HD and provide insights into new targets for pharmacotherapy.\n## Response:\n"}

The primary outcome was change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) from baseline to endpoint.\nRESULTS: Least squares mean (+/-se) changes in HbA(1c) were similar between groups, meeting non-inferiority (margin, 0.4%): -0.69 +/- 0.07% for ILPS and -0.59 +/- 0.07% for insulin detemir [between-treatment difference -0.10%; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.29, 0.10]. Standard deviation of fasting blood glucose was similar (non-inferiority margin 0.8 mmol/l): 2.74 +/- 0.14 mmol/l for ILPS and 2.38 +/- 0.14 mmol/l for insulin detemir (CI -0.03, 0.75). Patients on ILPS gained more weight (1.59 +/- 0.23 kg vs. 0.62 +/- 0.24 kg; CI 0.34, 1.60; margin 1.5 kg). Weight-adjusted daily total and prandial insulin doses were lower for ILPS (prandial insulin, 0.38 +/- 0.01 U/kg/day for ILPS, 0.44 +/- 0.01 U/kg/day for insulin detemir; P = 0.004); daily basal insulin dose was similar. All hypoglycaemia incidence and rate and nocturnal hypoglycaemia incidence were similar between groups; nocturnal hypoglycaemia rate was lower for insulin detemir (mean +/- sd 0.79 +/- 1.23 for ILPS, 0.49 +/- 0.85 for insulin detemir; P = 0.001). Severe hypoglycaemia rate was 0.03 +/- 0.11 for ILPS and 0.02 +/- 0.10 for insulin detemir (P = 0.37).\nCONCLUSIONS: ILPS-treated patients with Type 1 diabetes achieved similar glycaemic control as insulin detemir-treated patients after 32 weeks. Glucose variability was similar. While weight gain and nocturnal hypoglycaemia rate were statistically higher with ILPS, the clinical relevance is unclear.\n## Response:\n"}

After 24 weeks, PBO patients were rerandomized to either ATX titration strategy. Efficacy measures included the Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale Total ADHD Symptoms score, Clinical Global Impression-ADHD-Severity, Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. General and titration safety measures and tolerability were evaluated.\nRESULTS: Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale Total ADHD Symptoms score reduction was greater with ATX over PBO at 12 weeks (-14.33 vs -10.05; P < 0.001) and 24 weeks (-16.43 vs -8.65; P < 0.001; effect size, 0.57). Response (25% decrease on Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale Total ADHD Symptoms) was greater for ATX (68%) than PBO (42%; P < 0.001) at 24 weeks. Clinical Global Impression-ADHD-Severity improvement was greater for ATX over PBO at 8 and 24 weeks (P < 0.001; effect sizes, 0.45 and 0.46, respectively). There were no significant changes in depressive or anxiety measures for either group. Discontinuation due to an adverse event was greater for on-label versus slow titration, although the rate of patients experiencing adverse events were comparable. Common adverse events included dry mouth, nausea, and decreased appetite.\nCONCLUSIONS: Atomoxetine demonstrated significant improvement in ADHD symptoms at 12 and 24 weeks over PBO. Adverse events overall and for on-label or slow titration to ATX were similar and consistent with previous adult ATX studies.\n## Response:\n"}

Behaviors were assessed using the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory Short Form (CMAI), incident reports, as needed medications (pro re nata [PRN]), and surveys of staff and residents' family members as indices of affect.\nRESULTS: Final CMAI scores and total PRNs employed were lower than baseline values with a trend for residents who used the garden more often to have less agitated behavior. Verbal inappropriate behaviors did not change significantly whereas physical incidents increased. Staff and family members felt that the wander garden decreased inappropriate behaviors and improved mood and quality of life of the dementia residents.\nCONCLUSIONS: Study design characteristics and garden management may have affected behaviors both positively and negatively. Additional studies are needed to explore the benefits of wander gardens for dementia residents.\n## Response:\n"}

To characterize more thoroughly the change in muscle activation patterns of people with LBP in response to a perturbation of standing balance, and to gain insight into the influence of early- vs. late-phase postural responses (differentiated by estimates of voluntary reaction times), this study evaluated the intermuscular patterns of electromyographic (EMG) activations from 24 people with and 21 people without a history of chronic, recurrent LBP in response to 12 directions of support surface translations. Two-factor general linear models examined differences between the 2 subject groups and 12 recorded muscles of the trunk and lower leg in the percentage of trials with bursts of EMG activation as well as the amplitudes of integrated EMG activation for each perturbation direction. The subjects with LBP exhibited 1) higher baseline EMG amplitudes of the erector spinae muscles before perturbation onset, 2) fewer early-phase activations at the internal oblique and gastrocnemius muscles, 3) fewer late-phase activations at the erector spinae, internal and external oblique, rectus abdominae, and tibialis anterior muscles, and 4) higher EMG amplitudes of the gastrocnemius muscle following the perturbation. The results indicate that a history of LBP associates with higher baseline muscle activation and that EMG responses are modulated from this activated state, rather than exhibiting acute burst activity from a quiescent state, perhaps to circumvent trunk displacements.\n## Response:\n"}

With adequate treatment, some ulcers may last only weeks; however, many ulcers are difficult to treat and may last months, in certain cases years; 19-35% of ulcers are reported as nonhealing. As no efficient therapy is available, it is a high priority to develop new strategies for treatment of this devastating complication. Because experimental and pathological studies suggest that incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 may improves VEGF generation and promote the upregulation of HIF-1\u03b1 through a reduction of oxidative stress, the study evaluated the effect of the augmentation of GLP-1, by inhibitors of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4, such as vildagliptin, on angiogenesis process and wound healing in diabetic chronic ulcers. Although elucidation of the pathophysiologic importance of these aspects awaits further confirmations, the present study evidences an additional aspect of how DPP-4 inhibition might contribute to improved ulcer outcome.\n## Response:\n"}

The authors evaluated a multicomponent intervention combining community education with navigation services to reduce access barriers and increase screening rates in this underserved population. It was hypothesized that cervical cancer screening rates would be higher among women who received the intervention program compared with those in the control program.\nMETHODS: Korean American women (N\u2009=\u2009705) were recruited from 22 churches. In this matched-pair, group-randomized design, 347 women received the intervention, which consisted of a culturally relevant cancer education program combined with provision of navigation services. The control group (N\u2009=\u2009358) received general health education, including information about cervical cancer risk and screening and where to obtain low-cost or no-cost screening. Screening behavior was assessed 12 months after the program.\nRESULTS: Screening behavior data were obtained from 588 women 12 months after the program. In both site-level and participant-level analyses, the intervention program contributed to significantly higher screening rates compared with the control program (odds ratio [OR], 25.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 10.1-66.1; P\u2009<\u2009.001). In sensitivity analysis, the treatment effect remained highly significant (OR, 16.7; 95% CI, 8.1-34.4; P\u2009<\u2009.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: A multicomponent intervention combining community cancer education with navigation services yielded significant increases in cervical cancer screening rates among underscreened Korean American women. Community-accessible programs that incorporate cancer education with the delivery of key navigation services can be highly effective in increasing cervical cancer screening rates in this underserved population.

It is known that this procedure provides better sternal stability; however, its contribution to patient recovery has not been investigated.\nMETHODS: Retrospective chart review was conducted for patients who underwent CABG and/or valve surgery in our institution between 2009 and 2010. Preoperative, perioperative, and follow-up data of patients with ridgid fixation (group R, n=89) were collected and compared with those patients with conventional sternal closure (group C, n=133). The decision regarding the sternal closure method was based on the surgeon's preferences. Univariate followed by multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the dominant factor of sternal lock usage and to evaluate postoperative recoveries. The factors included in the analyses were; age, sex, coronary risk factors, urgency of surgery, ejection fraction, coronary anatomy, preoperative stroke, renal function, and preoperative presence of heart failure. All statistical analyses were performed by JMP software.\nRESULTS: Group R was younger (62 \u00b1 9 in group R vs 69 \u00b1 11 in group C, p<0.0001) than group C, more male dominant (61% vs 49%, p=0.0452), had a lower percentage of patients undergoing redo-surgery (2.2% vs 9.0%, p<0.0418), was more likely to be used in isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (71% vs 46%, p=0.0002), more often to be used for large patient (body mass index, BMI greater than 30) (58% vs 37%. P=0.0045), and patients were more likely to have a low EuroSCORE (2.6 \u00b1 2.3 vs 4.4 \u00b1 2.7). Intubation time (13 \u00b1 20 hours vs 39 \u00b1 97 hours, p=0.0030), ICU stay (58 \u00b1 40 hours vs 99 \u00b1 119 hours, p=0.0003), and postoperative length of stay (7.0 \u00b1 3.7 days vs 8.4 \u00b1 4.7 days, p<0.0141) were significantly shorter in group R than group C. Multivariate analyses showed ridged sternal fixation was the most dominant factor affecting intubation time and ICU stay.\nCONCLUSION: Rigid sternal fixation systems were more frequently applied to low risk young male patients. Among these selected patients, ridgid sternal fixation can contribute to early patient recovery.\n## Response:\n"}

PATIENTS AND METHODS Nine hundred twenty-six patients were randomly assigned to receive up to six 21-day cycles of carboplatin area under the curve 6 and paclitaxel 200 mg/m(2) (CP) on day 1, followed by either sorafenib 400 mg twice a day (n = 464, arm A) or placebo (n = 462, arm B) on days 2 to 19. The maintenance phase after CP consisted of sorafenib 400 mg or placebo twice a day. The primary end point was overall survival (OS); secondary end points included progression-free survival and tumor response. RESULTS Overall demographics were balanced between arms; 223 patients (24%) had squamous cell histology. On the basis of a planned interim analysis, median OS was 10.7 months in arm A and 10.6 months in arm B (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.15; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.41; P = .915). The study was terminated after the interim analysis concluded that the study was highly unlikely to meet its primary end point. A prespecified exploratory analysis revealed that patients with squamous cell histology had greater mortality in arm A than in arm B (HR = 1.85; 95% CI, 1.22 to 2.81). Main grade 3 or 4 sorafenib-related toxicities included rash (8.4%), hand-foot skin reaction (7.8%), and diarrhea (3.5%). CONCLUSION No clinical benefit was observed from adding sorafenib to CP chemotherapy as first-line treatment for NSCLC.\n## Response:\n"}

This phase 3, enriched-enrollment, randomized-withdrawal trial evaluated the analgesic efficacy, safety, and tolerability of NKTR-181 in patients with chronic low-back pain (CLBP). Adults with moderate-to-severe CLBP refractory to nonopioid analgesics achieving an analgesic NKTR-181 dosage (100-400 mg twice daily) during the open-label titration period were randomized to continued NKTR-181 treatment, double-blind, or switched to placebo. The study was conducted at 55 sites in the United States. Of 1189 patients exposed to NKTR-181 during the titration period, 610 were randomized to NKTR-181 100 to 400 mg every 12 hours or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure was change in weekly pain score (scale, 0-10) at 12 weeks from randomization baseline. Secondary outcome measures included responder rates defined by \u226530% and \u226550% improvement in pain score from screening to 12 weeks. Among 610 randomized patients, the mean pain score decreased from 6.73 to 2.32 during open-label titration. After randomization, the least-squares mean change in pain score was +0.92 for NKTR-181 vs +1.46 for placebo (P = 0.002). The \u226530%-improvement responder rate of NKTR-181 vs placebo was 71.2% vs 57.1% (P < 0.001), and the \u226550%-improvement responder rate was 51.1% vs 37.9% (P = 0.001). NKTR-181 was well tolerated with a low incidence (<3%) of CNS-related adverse events during the randomized treatment phase. In patients with moderate-to-severe CLBP, NKTR-181 demonstrated significant analgesic efficacy and a favorable safety/tolerability profile, with a low incidence of CNS adverse events.\n## Response:\n"}

We tested the hypothesis that TC improves physical function in older adults living in low-income housing facilities.\nDESIGN: Cluster randomized controlled trial.\nSETTING: Subsidized housing facilities in Boston, Massachusetts, and neighboring communities.\nPARTICIPANTS: Volunteers were recruited from 15 facilities. The 180 randomized participants were\u200960\u2009years of age or older, able to understand English and participate in TC, expected to remain in the facility for 1 year, and able to walk independently.\nINTERVENTION: TC classes were conducted in the housing facilities twice/week for 1\u2009year and compared with monthly health promotion educational classes and social calls.\nMEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was physical function measured by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Secondary outcomes included other aspects of physical and cognitive function, and falls.\nRESULTS: An interim analysis revealed less improvement over 12\u2009months in SPPB scores among TC participants (+.20\u2009units; 95% confidence interval [CI] = -.20 to +.60; P =\u2009.69) vs control participants (+.51\u2009units; 95% CI =\u2009+.15 to +.87; P =\u2009.007), a difference of -.31\u2009units (95% CI =\u2009-.66 to .04; P =\u2009.082). This met the criterion for futility, and the Data Safety Monitoring Board recommended trial termination. No differences were found in 6- or 12-month changes favoring TC in any secondary outcomes or adverse events.\nCONCLUSION: In older adults with multiple chronic conditions living in subsidized housing facilities, 6 and 12\u2009months of twice/week TC classes were not associated with improvements in functional health.

Behavioral economics has stimulated renewed interest in economic-based, population-level health interventions to address this issue. Despite widespread implementation of financial incentive-based public health and workplace wellness policies, the effects of financial incentives on exercise initiation and maintenance in adults remain unclear.\nEVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic search of 15 electronic databases for RCTs reporting the impact of financial incentives on exercise-related behaviors and outcomes was conducted in June 2012. A meta-analysis of exercise session attendance among included studies was conducted in April 2013. A qualitative analysis was conducted in February 2013 and structured along eight features of financial incentive design.\nEVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Eleven studies were included (N=1453; ages 18-85 years and 50% female). Pooled results favored the incentive condition (z=3.81, p<0.0001). Incentives also exhibited significant, positive effects on exercise in eight of the 11 included studies. One study determined that incentives can sustain exercise for longer periods (>1 year), and two studies found exercise adherence persisted after the incentive was withdrawn. Promising incentive design feature attributes were noted. Assured, or \"sure thing,\" incentives and objective behavioral assessment in particular appear to moderate incentive effectiveness. Previously sedentary adults responded favorably to incentives 100% of the time (n=4).\nCONCLUSIONS: The effect estimate from the meta-analysis suggests that financial incentives increase exercise session attendance for interventions up to 6 months in duration. Similarly, a simple count of positive (n=8) and null (n=3) effect studies suggests that financial incentives can increase exercise adherence in adults in the short term (<6 months).\n## Response:\n"}

The Philips Allura FD20 system allows switching between the reference (Allura Xper) and the novel X-ray imaging technology (Allura Clarity). Primary end-point was overall procedural patient dose, expressed in dose area product (DAP) and air kerma (AK). Operator dose, procedural success, and necessity to switch to higher dose settings were secondary end-points.\nRESULTS: A total of 136 patients were randomly assigned to the novel imaging group (n = 68) or the reference group (n = 68). Baseline characteristics were similar, except patients in the novel imaging group were younger (58 vs 65 years, P < .01). Median DAP and AK were 43% and 40% lower in the novel imaging group, respectively (P < .0001). A 50% operator dose reduction was achieved in the novel imaging group (P < .001). Fluoroscopy time, number of exposure frames, and procedure duration were equivalent between the two groups, indicating that the image quality was similarly adequate in both groups. Procedural success was achieved in 91% of patients in both groups; one pericardial tamponade occurred in the novel imaging group.\nCONCLUSION: The novel imaging technology, Allura Clarity, significantly reduces patient and operator dose in complex EP procedures while maintaining image quality.\n## Response:\n"}

The objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lurasidone in patients hospitalized for an acute exacerbation of DSM-IV-defined schizophrenia.\nMETHOD: Patients were randomly assigned to 6 weeks of double-blind treatment with a fixed dose of lurasidone 80 mg (N = 90, 75.6% male, mean age = 39.7 years, mean baseline score on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale derived from the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [BPRSd] = 55.1) or placebo (N = 90, 77.8% male, mean age = 41.9 years, mean BPRSd score = 56.1). The primary efficacy measure was the BPRSd. The study was conducted from May to December 2004.\nRESULTS: At day 42, last-observation-carried-forward endpoint, treatment with lurasidone was associated with significant improvement compared to placebo on the BPRSd (least squares mean +/- SE = -8.9 +/- 1.3 vs. -4.2 +/- 1.4; p = .012), as well as on all secondary efficacy measures, including the PANSS total score (-14.1 +/- 2.1 vs. -5.5 +/- 2.2; p = .004) and the PANSS positive (-4.3 +/- 0.7 vs. -1.7 +/- 0.7; p = .006), negative (-2.9 +/- 0.5 vs. -1.3 +/- 0.5; p = .025), and general psychopathology (-7.0 +/- 1.1 vs. -2.7 +/- 1.2; p = .0061) subscales. Significant improvement was seen as early as day 3, based on BPRSd, PANSS, and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness assessments. Treatment with lurasidone was generally well tolerated and was not associated with adverse changes in metabolic or electrocardiogram parameters. There were no clinically significant differences between lurasidone and placebo in objective measures of extrapyramidal symptoms.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that the novel psychotropic agent lurasidone is a safe and effective treatment for patients with an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: (ClinicalTrials.gov) Identifier: NCT00088634.\n## Response:\n"}

Heating instead of burning tobacco reduces, or eliminates, the formation of harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHC) that are found in cigarette smoke. The Carbon-Heated Tobacco Product (CHTP), a heat-not-burn tobacco product, mimics the cigarette smoking ritual. This randomized, open-label, two-arm, parallel-group, short-term confinement study tested the hypothesis that the geometric means of the BoExp levels for subjects switching to CHTP 1.0 for 5\u00a0days are lower relative to those continuing to smoke cigarettes. Biomarkers of exposure (BoExp), including nicotine, urinary excretion of mutagenic constituents (Ames test), and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 activity, were measured in blood and/or 24-h urine samples during ad libitum product use. Nicotine exposure remained at similar levels in individuals using CHTP as in those continuing to smoke cigarettes. Switching to CHTP resulted in marked decreases in all other urinary BoExp (56-97%), carboxyhemoglobin (59%), urinary mutagenic constituents, and CYP1A2 activity compared with continued cigarette smoking. Our results provide evidence of decreased exposure to 15 selected HPHCs in smokers switching from cigarettes to exclusive CHTP use.Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02503254; Date of first registration: 20/07/2015 https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02503254 .Study protocol Study protocol published at: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ProvidedDocs/54/NCT02503254/Prot_000.pdf .\n## Response:\n"}

The neuropathogenesis of HAND is thought to be driven by HIV invasion and productive replication within brain perivascular macrophages and endogenous microglia, and to some degree by restricted infection of astrocytes. The persistence of HAND in individuals experiencing suppression of systemic HIV viral load with antiretroviral therapy (ART) is incompletely explained, and suggested factors include chronic inflammation, persistent HIV replication in brain macrophages, effects of aging on brain vulnerability, and co-morbid conditions including hepatitis C (HCV) co-infection, substance abuse, and CNS toxicity of ART, among other factors. This review discusses several of these conditions: chronic inflammation, co-infection with HCV, drugs of abuse, aging, and antiretroviral drug effects. Effectively managing these co-morbid conditions in individuals with and without HAND is critical for improving neurocognitive outcomes and decreasing HIV-associated morbidity.\n## Response:\n"}

This study examined the prevalence of such discrimination, and its association with health status, for the 3 largest race/ethnic groups in the United States.\nMETHODS: Data were drawn from the 2004 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey. The primary variables were perceived racial discrimination in health care and self-reported health status. Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare the prevalence of perceived discrimination for whites, African Americans, and Hispanics, and to examine the association between perceived discrimination and health status, controlling for sex, age, income, education, health care coverage, affordability of medical care, racial salience, and state.\nRESULTS: Perceived discrimination was reported by 2%, 5.2%, and 10.9% of whites, Hispanics, and African Americans, respectively. Only the difference between African Americans and whites remained significant in adjusted analyses [odds ratio (OR) = 3.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.46-4.21]. Racial/ethnic differences in perceived discrimination depended on income, education, health care coverage, and affordability of medical care. Perceived discrimination was associated with worse health status for the overall sample (OR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.35-2.16). Stratified analyses revealed that this relationship was significant for whites (OR = 2.00, 95% CI = 1.45-2.77) and African Americans (OR = 1.95, 95% CI = 1.39-2.73), but not for Hispanics (OR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.24-1.22).\nCONCLUSIONS: Perceived racial discrimination in health care is much more prevalent for African Americans than for whites or Hispanics. Furthermore, such discrimination is associated with worse health both for African Americans and for whites.\n## Response:\n"}

Between July 1998 and October 1999, 400 unselected consecutive premenopausal women (18-45 yr of age) seeking a preemployment physical at the University of Alabama at Birmingham were studied (223 Black, 166 White, and 11 of other races). Evaluation included a history and physical examination, a modified Ferriman-Gallwey hirsutism score, and serum screening for hyperandrogenemia, hyperprolactinemia, and 21-hydroxylase-deficient nonclassical adrenal hyperplasia. PCOS was diagnosed by the presence of the following: 1) oligoovulation, 2) hyperandrogenemia and/or hirsutism (modified Ferriman-Gallwey score > or = 6), and 3) the exclusion of related disorders. Confirmed PCOS was established in those individuals whose evaluation was complete and indicative of PCOS, and possible PCOS was established when the hormonal evaluation was not complete or was unavailable, but the clinical phenotype was otherwise suggestive of the disorder. The individual probability of PCOS in women with possible PCOS was assigned a weight based on the findings in similar subjects whose evaluation was complete, and the total number of PCOS cases arising from these individuals was calculated (i.e. individual probability of PCOS x total number of subjects in the group). The cumulative prevalence of PCOS in our population was 6.6% (26.5 of 400), including 15 subjects among the 347 women completing their evaluation and a calculated prevalence of 11.5 subjects among the remainder. The prevalence rates of PCOS for Black and White women were 8.0 and 4.8%, respectively, not significantly different. These data from a large representative unselected population support the concept that PCOS is the most common endocrine abnormality of reproductive-aged women in the United States.\n## Response:\n"}

Two hundred thirty-two participants were recruited between June 2004 and May 2008 and followed for 6 months or until pressure ulcer incidence.\nSETTING: Twelve nursing homes.\nPARTICIPANTS: Nursing home residents aged 65 and older who were using wheelchairs for 6 or more hours per day and had a Braden score of 18 or less and a combined Braden activity and mobility score of 5 or less. Participants were recruited from a referred sample.\nINTERVENTION: All participants were provided with a fitted wheelchair and randomized into skin protection (SPC, n=113) or segmented foam (SFC, n=119) cushion groups. The SPC group received an air, viscous fluid and foam, or gel and foam cushion. The SFC group received a 7.6-cm crosscut foam cushion.\nMEASUREMENTS: Pressure ulcer incidence over 6 months for wounds near the ischial tuberosities (IT ulcers) were measured. Secondary analysis was performed on combined IT ulcers and ulcers over the sacrum and coccyx (sacral ulcers).\nRESULTS: One hundred eighty participants reached a study end point, and 42 were lost to follow-up. Ten did not receive the intervention. There were eight (6.7%) IT ulcers in the SFC group and one (0.9%) in the SPC group (P=.04). There were 21 (17.6%) combined IT and sacral ulcers in the SFC group and 12 (10.6%) in the SPC group (P=.14).\nCONCLUSION: Skin protection cushions used with fitted wheelchairs lower pressure ulcer incidence for elderly nursing home residents and should be used to help prevent pressure ulcers.\n## Response:\n"}

We aimed to assess whether bihormonal bionic pancreas initialised only with body mass can safely reduce mean glycaemia and hypoglycaemia in adults with type 1 diabetes who were living at home and participating in their normal daily routines without restrictions on diet or physical activity.\nMETHODS: We did a random-order crossover study in volunteers at least 18 years old who had type 1 diabetes and lived within a 30 min drive of four sites in the USA. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) in blocks of two using sequentially numbered sealed envelopes to glycaemic regulation with a bihormonal bionic pancreas or usual care (conventional or sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy) first, followed by the opposite intervention. Both study periods were 11 days in length, during which time participants continued all normal activities, including athletics and driving. The bionic pancreas was initialised with only the participant's body mass. Autonomously adaptive dosing algorithms used data from a continuous glucose monitor to control subcutaneous delivery of insulin and glucagon. The coprimary outcomes were the mean glucose concentration and time with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) glucose concentration less than 3\u00b73 mmol/L, analysed over days 2-11 in participants who completed both periods of the study. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02092220.\nFINDINGS: We randomly assigned 43 participants between May 6, 2014, and July 3, 2015, 39 of whom completed the study: 20 who were assigned to bionic pancreas first and 19 who were assigned to the comparator first. The mean CGM glucose concentration was 7\u00b78 mmol/L (SD 0\u00b76) in the bionic pancreas period versus 9\u00b70 mmol/L (1\u00b76) in the comparator period (difference 1\u00b71 mmol/L, 95% CI 0\u00b77-1\u00b76; p<0\u00b70001), and the mean time with CGM glucose concentration less than 3\u00b73 mmol/L was 0\u00b76% (0\u00b76) in the bionic pancreas period versus 1\u00b79% (1\u00b77) in the comparator period (difference 1\u00b73%, 95% CI 0\u00b78-1\u00b78; p<0\u00b70001). The mean nausea score on the Visual Analogue Scale (score 0-10) was greater during the bionic pancreas period (0\u00b752 [SD 0\u00b783]) than in the comparator period (0\u00b705 [0\u00b717]; difference 0\u00b747, 95% CI 0\u00b721-0\u00b773; p=0\u00b70024). Body mass and laboratory parameters did not differ between periods. There were no serious or unexpected adverse events in the bionic pancreas period of the study.\nINTERPRETATION: Relative to conventional and sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy, the bihormonal bionic pancreas, initialised only with participant weight, was able to achieve superior glycaemic regulation without the need for carbohydrate counting. Larger and longer studies are needed to establish the long-term benefits and risks of automated glycaemic management with a bihormonal bionic pancreas.\nFUNDING: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National Institutes of Health, and National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences.\n## Response:\n"}

Our study was designed to compare velocity changes with flow changes measured by two magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques, perfusion MRI and arterial spin labeling (ASL), using flavanol-rich cocoa to induce CBF changes in healthy volunteers.\nMETHODS: We enrolled 20 healthy volunteers aged 62 to 80 years (mean, 73 years). Each was studied at baseline and after drinking standardized servings of cocoa for 7 to 14 days.\nRESULTS: Changes in middle cerebral artery (MCA) flow by TCD were significantly correlated with changes in perfusion assessed by gadolinium-enhanced MRI (r = 0.63; P < .03). Measurements with ASL showed a stronger correlation with borderline significance.\nCONCLUSIONS: Changes in flow velocity in the MCA associated with drinking cocoa were highly correlated with changes in CBF measured by the two MRI techniques using the tracer gadolinium and ASL. These results validate Doppler measurements of CBF velocity as representative assessments of CBF.\n## Response:\n"}

We hypothesized that concentering renal denervation treatment in the distal region of the artery would improve clinical response.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a single-center, double-blind, randomized, controlled, and parallel group study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02667912). Fifty-one treatment-resistant hypertensive patients meeting guideline indications were randomized either to 'conventional' treatment restricted to the main renal artery (n\u200a=\u200a26) or to 'distal' treatment applied mainly in the distal branches beyond the main bifurcation (n\u200a=\u200a25). Computer-based treatment assignment was performed in the catheterization laboratory at the time of the procedure by the interventional radiologist and remained unknown to patients, investigators, and other outcomes assessors for the entire study period. Six months after randomization, the distal therapy group (n\u200a=\u200a24) had a significantly greater decrease in the primary outcome, 24-h mean ambulatory SBP, as compared with the conventionally treated group (n\u200a=\u200a21): -22.6\u200a\u00b1\u200a20.0 vs -9.4\u200a\u00b1\u200a18.7\u200ammHg; P less than 0.05. No major safety issues were observed in either group.\nCONCLUSION: Percutaneous renal denervation treatment was significantly less effective at lowering 24-h blood pressure in treatment-resistant hypertensive patients when therapy was applied conventionally in the trunk of renal artery as compared with when applied to distal segmental branches. This observation is in accordance with previous surgical and anatomical findings showing that most renal nerve fibers are distant from the lumen proximally and become available for endovascular treatment mainly in the distal portion of the vessel.\n## Response:\n"}

Study Design Prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Setting Sixty-nine secondary and tertiary sites in North America, Europe, and Asia. Subjects and Methods In total, 343 subjects with persistent acute tinnitus after traumatic cochlear injury or otitis media were randomized to receive 3 intratympanic doses of either AM-101 0.87 mg/mL or placebo over 3 to 5 days. They were followed for 84 days. The primary safety end point was the incidence of a clinically meaningful hearing deterioration from baseline to study day 35. Further safety assessments included tympanic membrane closure rates, analysis of adverse events, hematology, blood chemistry, and vital signs. In addition, data were collected on applied anesthetics and injection techniques. Results The treatment was well tolerated, with no intervention-related serious adverse events. The incidence of clinically meaningful hearing deterioration was low, comparable between treatment groups ( P = .82 for the primary safety end point) and not different between treated and untreated ears in unilaterally treated subjects. The rate of treatment and procedure-related adverse events was similar among treatment groups. The tympanic membrane was closed in 92% of subjects within 1 week and in all subjects by study day 84. Blood values and vital signs were inconspicuous. Conclusion Repeated intratympanic injections of AM-101 over a 3- to 5-day period appear to be safe and well tolerated, demonstrating the ability to potentially use this delivery approach over longer time periods.\n## Response:\n"}

Although mental health care estimated costs were higher for active treatment than for usual care, overall health care estimated costs were not significantly different (difference adjusting for confounding, -$325; 95% CI, -$2639 to $1989; P = .78).\nCONCLUSIONS: For patients with post-ACS depression, active treatment had a substantial beneficial effect on depressive symptoms. This kind of depression care is feasible, effective, and may be cost-neutral within 6 months; therefore, it should be tested in a large phase 3 pragmatic trial.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01032018.\n## Response:\n"}

Current treatments have limited applicability and low cure rates. Recently introduced laser therapy has shown to be a safe and effective treatment for onychomycosis. In this study, we evaluate a submillisecond Nd:YAG 1,064 nm laser for treating onychomycoses of the tonail.\nMETHODS: Thirteen subjects (9 female, 4 male) with 37 affected toenails received 1 to 3 treatments 4 and/or 8 weeks apart with a sub-millisecond 1,064 nm Nd:YAG laser. Diagnosis of onychomycosis was confirmed with microscopy. Average follow-up time was 16 weeks post-final treatment. Photos were taken and degree of turbidity was determined using a turbidity scale (ranging from \"0 = clear nail\" to \"10 = completely turbid nail\") at each visit. Improvement in turbidity was determined by comparison of turbidity scores at baseline and 16-week follow-up on average. Efficacy was assessed by an overall improvement scale (0 to 4), which combined improvement in turbidity scores and microscopic examination. Overall improvement was classified as \"4 = complete clearance\" if the turbidity score indicated \"0 = clear nail\" accompanied by a negative microscopic result. No microscopic examination was performed unless the turbidity score showed \"0 = clear nail.\"\nRESULTS: Treatments were well tolerated by all subjects and there were no adverse events. Of the 37 toenails treated, 30 (81%) had \"moderate\" to \"complete\" clearance average of 16 weeks post-final treatment. Nineteen toenails (51%) were completely clear and all tested negative for fungal infection on direct microscopic analysis. Seven (19%) toenails had significant clearance and four (11%) had moderate clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS: The preliminary results of this study show this treatment modality is safe and effective for the treatment of onychomycosis in the short term. Additional studies are needed to more fully assess the clinical and mycological benefits as well as optimize the treatment protocol and parameters.\n## Response:\n"}

One hundred twelve women awaited breast biopsy; 42, hepatic chemoembolization for cancer; and 60, uterine fibroid embolization. Data were analyzed with multivariate analysis of variance and post hoc Tukey tests. Results are reported as means and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\nRESULTS: All three patient groups experienced abnormally high mean PSS, IES, and CES-D scores, but only the breast biopsy group had highly abnormal anxiety levels. Breast biopsy patients had a significantly higher mean STAI score of 48 (95% CI: 45, 50) than did women awaiting hepatic chemoembolization (mean score, 26; 95% CI: 22, 29; P < .001) and fibroid embolization (mean score, 24; 95% CI: 21, 27; P < .001). IES ratings did not differ significantly among the groups, with a mean score of 26 (95% CI: 23, 29) for breast biopsy patients, 23 (95% CI: 18, 28) for hepatic chemoembolization patients, and 23 (95% CI: 18, 27) for fibroid embolization patients. The CES-D score did not differ significantly among breast biopsy (mean score, 15; 95% CI: 13, 17), hepatic chemoembolization (mean score, 14; 95% CI: 11, 18), and fibroid embolization (mean score, 12; 95% CI: 9, 15) patients. PSS ratings of breast biopsy patients were significantly higher (mean score, 18; 95% CI: 16, 19) than those of hepatic chemoembolization patients (mean, 15; 95% CI: 13, 17; P < .01), but they were not significantly different from those of women awaiting fibroid embolization (mean, 16; 95% CI: 14, 18; P = .23).\nCONCLUSION: Uncertainty of diagnosis can be associated with greater stress than is awaiting more invasive and potentially risky treatment.\n## Response:\n"}

Each patient participated in two 40-h outpatient sessions, CLC versus OL, in randomized order. Sensor (Dexcom G4) and insulin pump (Tandem t:slim) were connected to Diabetes Assistant (DiAs)-a smartphone artificial pancreas platform. The patient operated the system through the DiAs user interface during both CLC and OL; study personnel supervised on site and monitored DiAs remotely. There were no dietary restrictions; 45-min walks in town and restaurant dinners were included in both CLC and OL; alcohol was permitted.\nRESULTS: The primary outcome-reduction in risk for hypoglycemia as measured by the low blood glucose (BG) index (LGBI)-resulted in an effect size of 0.64, P = 0.003, with a twofold reduction of hypoglycemia requiring carbohydrate treatment: 1.2 vs. 2.4 episodes/session on CLC versus OL (P = 0.02). This was accompanied by a slight decrease in percentage of time in the target range of 3.9-10 mmol/L (66.1 vs. 70.7%) and increase in mean BG (8.9 vs. 8.4 mmol/L; P = 0.04) on CLC versus OL.\nCONCLUSIONS: CLC running on a smartphone (DiAs) in outpatient conditions reduced hypoglycemia and hypoglycemia treatments when compared with sensor-augmented pump therapy. This was accompanied by marginal increase in average glycemia resulting from a possible overemphasis on hypoglycemia safety.\n## Response:\n"}

Clinic services were used by a representative cross-section of the Australian population. Mean age at assessment was 36.4\u00b113.0 years, and age range was 18-86 years. Patients completed one of four online courses over eight weeks, during which they received weekly support from a therapist via telephone or secure e-mail. Primary outcome measures were the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) administered at posttreatment and three months posttreatment.\nRESULTS: A total of 10,293 adults who self-identified as having problems with anxiety or depression commenced assessment, and 7,172 completed the assessment and were eligible for analysis. Of these, 2,049 enrolled in a course and 1,471 completed the course, for a course completion rate of 71.8%. Moderate to large noncontrolled effect sizes (Cohen's d=.67-1.66, 95% confidence interval=.08-2.07) were found from assessment to three-month follow-up. At posttreatment and follow-up, reliable recovery ranged from 46.7% to 51.1%, and deterioration ranged from 1.9% to 3.8%. Mean total therapist time per patient was 111.8\u00b161.6 minutes.\nCONCLUSIONS: The MindSpot Clinic produced treatment outcomes that were comparable to results from published clinical trials of iCBT. This model of service delivery represents an innovative method of providing accessible, low-cost, effective, and acceptable mental health services to many people who currently are not receiving care.\n## Response:\n"}

Subjects were recruited from the female urology and urogynecology clinics at Duke University. Inclusion criteria included evidence of UUI on 3-day bladder diary, a 24-hour pad weight of 100 gm or greater, absent or minimal stress leakage, absent detrusor dysfunction, and a history of failed anticholinergic and physical therapies. Exclusion criteria included evidence of a urinary tract infection, or other correctable or neurological etiology for UUI. The detrusor of each subject was injected with 150 units of botulinum-A toxin. Evaluations were performed at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after injection. Outcome measures included daily incontinence episodes, Urogenital Distress Inventory and the Incontinence Impact Questionnaire, 24-hour pad weights, daily pad usage and urinalysis at all visits. Urodynamic studies were performed at the 6-week and 3-month visits.\nRESULTS: Three subjects had uncomplicated urinary tract infections during followup. No other adverse effects occurred. Statistically and clinically significant decreases greater than 50% were seen in virtually all outcome measures at all visits up to 3 months. Most subjects showed signs of recurrent UUI by 6 months. All subjects reported remarkable subjective improvement in incontinence. No significant changes in maximal cystometric capacity, maximal detrusor pressure, peak flow or post-void residual volumes were seen.\nCONCLUSIONS: Botulinum-A toxin can significantly decrease urge urinary incontinence and improve quality of life for 3 months after injection. Additional studies are needed to determine ideal doses, dosing intervals, safety and cost-effectiveness of this therapy.\n## Response:\n"}

Each patient underwent a clinical evaluation before and after real tDCS or sham stimulation. A follow-up evaluation was performed at 1 and 3 months with a crossover washout period of 3 months. Cerebello-motor connectivity was evaluated with transcranial magnetic stimulation at baseline and at each follow-up.\nRESULTS: Cerebello-spinal tDCS showed a significant improvement in all performance scores (Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia, International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale, 9-Hole Peg Test, 8-m walking time), in motor cortex excitability, and in cerebellar brain inhibition compared to sham stimulation.\nCONCLUSIONS: A 2-week treatment with cerebello-spinal tDCS reduces symptoms in patients with ataxia and restores motor cortex inhibition exerted by cerebellar structures. Cerebello-spinal tDCS might represent a promising future therapeutic and rehabilitative approach in patients with neurodegenerative ataxia, still an orphan disorder of any pharmacologic intervention.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT03120013.\nCLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that cerebello-spinal stimulation is effective and safe in cerebellar ataxia.\n## Response:\n"}

Daily sodium intake, total fluid intake, energy intake, urine volume, and urinary sodium excretion were recorded. Total body water was measured by H(2)(18)O dilution on days 1, 7, and 14, and extracellular fluid volume by sodium bromide dilution on days 1 and 14.\nRESULTS: Twenty four infants received early, and 22 delayed, sodium supplementation. There were no significant differences between the groups in body water compartments on day 1. In the delayed group, but not the early group, there was a significant loss of total body water during the first week (delayed -44 ml/kg, p=0. 048; early 6 ml/kg, p=0.970). By day 14 the delayed, but not the early group, also had a significant reduction in extracellular fluid volume (delayed -53 ml/kg, p=0.01; early -37 ml/kg, p=0.2). These changes resulted in a significant alteration in body composition at the end of the first week (total body weight: delayed 791 ml/kg; early 849 ml/kg, p=0.013). By day 14 there were once again no significant differences in body composition between the two groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Body composition after preterm birth is influenced by the timing of introduction of routine sodium supplements. Early sodium supplementation can delay the physiological loss of body water that is part of normal postnatal adaptation. This is likely to be of particular relevance to babies with respiratory distress syndrome. A tailored approach to clinical management, delaying the introduction of routine sodium supplements until there has been postnatal loss of body water, is recommended.\n## Response:\n"}

We tested the hypothesis that three-dimensional imaging of the shoulder would increase inter-rater agreement for assessing the extent and location of glenoid bone loss and also would improve surgical planning for total shoulder arthroplasty.\nMETHODS: Four shoulder surgeons independently and retrospectively reviewed the preoperative computed tomography scans of twenty-four arthritic shoulders. The blinded images were evaluated with conventional two-dimensional imaging software and then later with novel three-dimensional imaging software. Measurements and preoperative judgments were made for each shoulder with use of each imaging modality and then were compared. The glenoid measurements were glenoid version and bone loss. The judgments were the zone of maximum glenoid bone loss, glenoid implant fit within the glenoid vault, and how to surgically address abnormal glenoid version and bone loss. Agreement between observers was evaluated with use of intraclass correlation coefficients and the weighted kappa coefficient (kappa), and we determined if surgical decisions changed with use of the three-dimensional data.\nRESULTS: The average glenoid version (and standard deviation) measured -17 degrees +/- 2.2 degrees on the two-dimensional images and -19 degrees +/- 2.4 degrees on the three-dimensional images (p < 0.05). The average posterior glenoid bone loss measured 9 +/- 2.3 mm on the two-dimensional images and 7 +/- 2 mm on the three-dimensional images (p < 0.05). The average anterior bone loss measured 1 mm on both the two-dimensional and the three-dimensional images. However, the intraclass correlation coefficients for anterior bone loss increased significantly with use of the three-dimensional data (from 0.36 to 0.70; p < 0.05). Observers were more likely to locate mid-anterior glenoid bone loss on the basis of the three-dimensional data (p < 0.05). The use of three-dimensional data provided greater agreement among observers with regard to the zone of glenoid bone loss, glenoid prosthetic fit, and surgical decision-making. Also, when the judgment of implant fit changed, observers more often determined that it would violate the vault walls on the basis of the three-dimensional data (p < 0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: The use of three-dimensional imaging can increase inter-rater agreement for the analysis of glenoid morphology and preoperative planning. Important considerations such as the extent and location of glenoid bone loss and the likelihood of implant fit were influenced by the three-dimensional data.\n## Response:\n"}

This study examined the relationships among stigma-related experiences and depression, medication adherence, serostatus disclosure, and sexual risk among 221 HIV-positive men and women. In bivariate analyses that controlled for background characteristics, stigma was associated with depressive symptoms, receiving recent psychiatric care, and greater HIV-related symptoms. Stigma was also associated with poorer adherence and more frequent serostatus disclosure to people other than sexual partners, but showed no association to sexual risk behavior. In a multivariate analysis that controlled for all correlates, depression, poor adherence, and serostatus disclosure remained as independent correlates of stigma-related experiences. Findings confirm that stigma is associated with psychological adjustment and adherence difficulties and is experienced more commonly among people who disclose their HIV status to a broad range of social contacts. Stigma should be addressed in stress management, health promotion, and medication adherence interventions for HIV-positive people.\n## Response:\n"}

High intracranial pressure and brain swelling can be controlled by the choice of anaesthetic agents, and also by optimal positioning of the patient. The use of positive end-expiratory pressure may impair cerebral blood flow, but the effects of positive end-expiratory pressure seem to depend on the respiratory system compliance. The international multicenter study failed to show any benefit from intraoperative hypothermia in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage; similarly, the results on corticosteroid therapy in head-injured patients are discouraging. Corticosteroid therapy has prompted studies on the control of blood glucose levels. While tight glycemic control has been recommended, it can have untoward effects manifested as cerebral metabolic stress.\nSUMMARY: From the clinical point of view, the recent research has added only little to the knowledge on the management of physiological parameters in neurosurgery. More adequately powered studies focusing in specific problems, and having a meaningful aim relative to outcome, are needed also in neuroanaesthesia.\n## Response:\n"}

PCV13 should be administered in series with the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23 [Pneumovax23, Merck & Co., Inc.]), the vaccine currently recommended for adults aged \u226565 years. PCV13 was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in late 2011 for use among adults aged \u226550 years. In June 2014, the results of a randomized placebo-controlled trial evaluating efficacy of PCV13 for preventing community-acquired pneumonia among approximately 85,000 adults aged \u226565 years with no prior pneumococcal vaccination history (CAPiTA trial) became available and were presented to ACIP. The evidence supporting PCV13 vaccination of adults was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework and determined to be type 2 (moderate level of evidence); the recommendation was categorized as a Category A recommendation. This report outlines the new recommendations for PCV13 use, provides guidance for use of PCV13 and PPSV23 among adults aged \u226565 years, and summarizes the evidence considered by ACIP to make this recommendation.\n## Response:\n"}

Based on the patient-centered medical home concept, PACTs aim to improve access, continuity, coordination, and comprehensiveness using team-based care that is patient driven and patient centered. However, how PACT principles should be applied to meet the needs of special populations, including women veterans, is not entirely clear. While historical differences in military participation meant women veterans were rarely seen in VA healthcare settings, they now represent the fastest growing segment of new VA users. They also have complex healthcare needs, adding gender-specific services and other needs to the spectrum of services that the VA must deliver. These trends are changing the VA landscape, introducing challenges to how VA care is organized, how VA providers need to be trained, and how VA considers implementation of new initiatives, such as PACT. We briefly describe the evolution of VA primary care delivery for women veterans, review VA policy for delivering gender-sensitive comprehensive primary care for women, and discuss the challenges that women veterans' needs pose in the context of PACT implementation. We conclude with recommendations for addressing some of these challenges moving forward.\n## Response:\n"}

The patients were randomized to receive either IV NTG (initial dose of 0.05 microg.kg(-1).min(-1), followed by 0.1 microg.kg(-1).min(-1)) or placebo after anesthetic induction until the end of CPB. The primary outcome was a decrease of 10% in NIRS values during CPB.\nRESULTS: Despite the absence of between-group difference in the mean cerebral oxygen saturation during CPB, there was a significant decrease in NIRS values during CPB in the placebo group, whereas mean NIRS values were maintained in the IV NTG group (-16.7% vs 2.3% in the NTG, P=0.019). Major hemodynamic variables were similar at corresponding time periods in both groups, while patients in the IV NTG group had higher CK-MB values and experienced greater blood loss during the first 24 hr postoperatively.\nCONCLUSION: Intravenous nitroglycerin administration before and during CPB may prevent a decrease in NIRS values associated with CPB in high-risk cardiac surgery. Further studies are warranted to determine the efficacy and the risks associated with IV NTG infusion for this indication during CPB in high-risk patients.\n## Response:\n"}

We investigated the hypothesis that the addition of clopidogrel to aspirin would reduce the risk of vascular events in patients with atrial fibrillation.\nMETHODS: A total of 7554 patients with atrial fibrillation who had an increased risk of stroke and for whom vitamin K-antagonist therapy was unsuitable were randomly assigned to receive clopidogrel (75 mg) or placebo, once daily, in addition to aspirin. The primary outcome was the composite of stroke, myocardial infarction, non-central nervous system systemic embolism, or death from vascular causes.\nRESULTS: At a median of 3.6 years of follow-up, major vascular events had occurred in 832 patients receiving clopidogrel (6.8% per year) and in 924 patients receiving placebo (7.6% per year) (relative risk with clopidogrel, 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81 to 0.98; P=0.01). The difference was primarily due to a reduction in the rate of stroke with clopidogrel. Stroke occurred in 296 patients receiving clopidogrel (2.4% per year) and 408 patients receiving placebo (3.3% per year) (relative risk, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.83; P<0.001). Myocardial infarction occurred in 90 patients receiving clopidogrel (0.7% per year) and in 115 receiving placebo (0.9% per year) (relative risk, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.59 to 1.03; P=0.08). Major bleeding occurred in 251 patients receiving clopidogrel (2.0% per year) and in 162 patients receiving placebo (1.3% per year) (relative risk, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.29 to 1.92; P<0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with atrial fibrillation for whom vitamin K-antagonist therapy was unsuitable, the addition of clopidogrel to aspirin reduced the risk of major vascular events, especially stroke, and increased the risk of major hemorrhage.

Pretreatment (baseline), 1-month post-treatment\nAbstract: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common debilitating condition where only one third of patients achieve remission after the first antidepressant treatment. Inadequate efficacy and adverse effects of current treatment strategies call for more effective and tolerable treatment options. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive approach to manipulate brain activity and alter cortical excitability. There has been more than 15 years of research on the use of repetitive form of TMS (rTMS) for the treatment of patients with depression, which has shown it to be an effective antidepressant treatment. Even though rTMS treatment has shown efficacy in treating depression, there is a high degree of interindividual variability in response. A newer form of rTMS protocol, known as theta-burst stimulation (TBS), has been shown to produce similar if not greater effects on brain activity than standard rTMS. TBS protocols have a major advantage over standard rTMS approaches in their reduced administration duration. Conventional rTMS procedures last between 20 and 45 min, as compared to TBS paradigms that require 1 to 3 min of stimulation. Recently, a small number of studies have suggested that TBS has similar or better efficacy in treating depression compared to rTMS. Optimization, identification of response predictors, and clarification of neurobiological mechanisms of TBS is required if it is to be further developed as a less time intensive, safe, and effective treatment for MDD.\n## Response:\n"}

Each subject received an intradermal injection of the buffered solution and the fresh solution. Immediately after each injection subjects rated the pain of infiltration on a 100-mm visual analog scale. The pain scores for the anesthetic solutions were compared using the paired t test.\nRESULTS: The pain score for the buffered solution was 18.3 +/- 20.3, and the pain score for the fresh solution was 23.5 +/- 19.1 (P = .0543). Sixty-five percent of subjects felt the fresh solution was more painful than the buffered solution.\nLIMITATIONS: The results did not reach statistical significance.\nCONCLUSION: In this small study, buffered lidocaine with epinephrine caused less pain on infiltration into the skin than lidocaine freshly mixed with epinephrine, but the results were not statistically significant.\n## Response:\n"}

However, there are no data on subjects with prediabetes. We aimed to investigate the effect of the FCHO inulin, on glucose homeostasis in subjects with prediabetes.\nMETHODS: In a double-blind and placebo-controlled crossover study, 40 volunteers with prediabetes were randomly allocated to take 30 g/day of inulin or cellulose for 2 weeks in a crossover trial, following a 4-week dose-escalation run-in. Fasting insulin and glucose were measured for all subjects. Fifteen of the 40 subjects also underwent a meal tolerance test to assess insulin sensitivity, free fatty acids and glucagon-like peptide-1 concentrations. A subanalysis was carried out to examine any differences between the prediabetes subtypes.\nRESULTS: Inulin was associated with a significant increase in (0-30 min)incremental AUC (iAUC) for insulin (treatment: p < 0.04) and (0-60 min)iAUC for insulin (treatment: p < 0.04) compared to control. There was a significant reduction in insulin resistance measured by the homeostatic model assessment in the isolated-impaired fasting glucose (p < 0.05) but not in the isolated-impaired glucose tolerance groups (p = 0.59).\nCONCLUSION: The FCHO, inulin, may have unique metabolic effects that are of particular benefit to people at risk of diabetes, which warrant further investigation.\n## Response:\n"}

These abnormalities are thought to reflect a deficiency in the synchronization of pyramidal cell activity that is dependent, in part, on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission through GABA type A (GABA(A)) receptors containing alpha(2) subunits. The authors conducted a proof-of-concept clinical trial designed to test the hypothesis that a novel compound with relatively selective agonist activity at GABA(A) receptors containing alpha(2) subunits would improve cognitive function and gamma band oscillations in individuals with schizophrenia.\nMETHOD: Participants were male subjects (N=15) with chronic schizophrenia who were randomly assigned to receive 4 weeks of treatment with the study drug MK-0777, a benzodiazepine-like agent with selective activity at GABA(A) receptors containing alpha(2) or alpha(3) subunits, or a matched placebo in a double-blind fashion. Outcome measures were the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status, three tests of working memory and/or cognitive control (N-back, AX Continuous Performance Test, and Preparing to Overcome Prepotency), and EEG measures of gamma band oscillations induced during the Preparing to Overcome Prepotency task.\nRESULTS: Compared with placebo, the MK-0777 compound was associated with improved performance on the N-back, AX Continuous Performance Test, and Preparing to Overcome Prepotency tasks. The compound was also associated with increased frontal gamma band power during the Preparing to Overcome Prepotency task. No effects of the MK-0777 compound were detected in BPRS or Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status scores, with the exception of improvement on the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status delayed memory index. The MK-0777 agent was well-tolerated.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings provide preliminary support for the hypothesis that enhanced GABA activity at alpha(2) subunit containing GABA(A) receptors improves behavioral and electrophysiological measures of prefrontal function in individuals with schizophrenia.\n## Response:\n"}

Adjunctive pharmacotherapy with ranolazine, an inhibitor of the late sodium current with anti-ischemic properties, may be effective in reducing recurrent events after PCI in patients with ICR.\nTRIAL DESIGN: RIVER-PCI is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international event-driven clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of ranolazine in patients with a history of chronic angina and ICR after PCI. Approximately 2,600 participants with ICR post-PCI will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to ranolazine or matched placebo within 14 days of an index PCI. The primary end point of the trial is time to the first occurrence of ischemia-driven revascularization or ischemia-driven hospitalization without revascularization. Participants will be followed up for a minimum of 1 year and until at least 720 confirmed primary end point events have occurred. Secondary end points include sudden cardiac death, cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and measures of quality of life and cost-effectiveness. The evaluation of long-term safety will include all-cause mortality, stroke, transient ischemic attack, and hospitalization for heart failure. Enrollment commenced in November 2011 and was completed in summer 2013.\nCONCLUSIONS: RIVER-PCI is a novel, large-scale, international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating the role of ranolazine in the long-term medical management of patients with ICR post-PCI.\n## Response:\n"}

However, the mechanism(s) contributing to opioid-induced proinflammatory actions remains unresolved. The potential involvement of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) was examined using in vitro, in vivo, and in silico techniques. Morphine non-stereoselectively induced TLR4 signaling in vitro, blocked by a classical TLR4 antagonist and non-stereoselectively by naloxone. Pharmacological blockade of TLR4 signaling in vivo potentiated acute intrathecal morphine analgesia, attenuated development of analgesic tolerance, hyperalgesia, and opioid withdrawal behaviors. TLR4 opposition to opioid actions was supported by morphine treatment of TLR4 knockout mice, which revealed a significant threefold leftward shift in the analgesia dose response function, versus wildtype mice. A range of structurally diverse clinically-employed opioid analgesics was found to be capable of activating TLR4 signaling in vitro. Selectivity in the response was identified since morphine-3-glucuronide, a morphine metabolite with no opioid receptor activity, displayed significant TLR4 activity, whilst the opioid receptor active metabolite, morphine-6-glucuronide, was devoid of such properties. In silico docking simulations revealed ligands bound preferentially to the LPS binding pocket of MD-2 rather than TLR4. An in silico to in vitro prediction model was built and tested with substantial accuracy. These data provide evidence that select opioids may non-stereoselectively influence TLR4 signaling and have behavioral consequences resulting, in part, via TLR4 signaling.\n## Response:\n"}

Rigid metal plates, a potential alternative to wire fixation, are thought to promote faster sternal healing by reducing motion at the wound site. The goal of this study was to compare the stability provided by commercially available sternal plates with standard wires using an in vitro model.\nMETHODS: Lateral distraction tests were conducted on bisected polyurethane sternal models fixed with either a standard 7 wire configuration (n = 5) or a 3 plate configuration (n = 3). To assure controlled loading, the sternal models were attached to a computer-controlled test machine by a novel tethering system that distributes the total force (180N) equally to eight locations on the sternum. Stability was defined as the ability to restrict sternal separation at seven locations along the midline quantified using digital image analysis.\nRESULTS: Our results indicate that rigid plate fixation significantly reduced lateral motion relative to wire fixation. The lower sternal region most noticeably benefited from plate fixation as the splaying observed for wire fixation was reduced.\nCONCLUSIONS: Under these loading conditions, plating increased stability at the midline compared to wires; this increased stability may facilitate the recovery of high-risk patients undergoing cardiac operation. To enhance in vitro testing methods, future studies should incorporate additional in vivo loading conditions applied to the sternum. Alternate plating configurations should also be examined to further increase stability.\n## Response:\n"}

We conducted a cluster randomized trial involving 15 primary care practices and 1,493 adults with nonvalvular AF in an integrated health care system between April 2014 and February 2015. Physicians in the intervention group received patient-level treatment recommendations made by the AFDST. Our primary outcome was the proportion of patients with antithrombotic therapy that was discordant from AFDST recommendation.\nRESULTS: Treatment was discordant in 42% of 801 patients in the intervention group. Physicians reviewed reports for 240 patients. Among these patients, thromboprophylaxis was discordant in 63%, decreasing to 59% 1 year later (P = .02). In nonstratified analyses, changes in discordant care were not significantly different between the intervention group and control groups. In multivariate regression models, assignment to the intervention group resulted in a nonsignificant trend toward decreased discordance (P = .29), and being a patient of a resident physician (P = .02) and a higher HAS-BLED score predicted decreased discordance (P = .03), whereas female gender (P = .01) and a higher CHADSVASc score (P = .10) predicted increased discordance.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among patients whose physicians reviewed recommendations of the decision support tool discordant therapy decreased significantly over 1 year. However, in nonstratified analyses, the intervention did not result in significant improvements in discordant antithrombotic therapy.\n## Response:\n"}

Thus far, ambulatory surgery has been limited by side effects and complications of general anesthesia. Paravertebral block offers the potential benefit of effective analgesia, with limited postoperative nausea and vomiting.\nMETHODS: The medical records of the first 15 patients with breast cancer who underwent 16 major operations for the treatment of breast cancer using paravertebral block were reviewed. Patients were either discharged directly from the recovery room or after overnight hospital admission. The effectiveness of anesthesia, surgical outcome, patient satisfaction, and hospital costs are reviewed.\nRESULTS: Paravertebral block achieved effective anesthesia for cancer operations of the breast and axilla; conversion to general anesthesia or supplementation with local anesthesia was not required. There was one postoperative hemorrhage, there were two seromas, and there was one superficial wound infection. Sensory block persisted for an average of 23 hours. Postoperative pain was effectively controlled, in fact, nine patients required no postoperative narcotic for pain control. Nausea and vomiting transiently afflicted three patients and prompted overnight observation in one patient originally scheduled for immediate discharge. Fourteen patients (93%) rated their experience as \"very satisfactory.\"\nCONCLUSION: Breast operations for the surgical management of breast cancer using paravertebral block can be performed safely, with great patient satisfaction, and with potential for significant cost savings.\n## Response:\n"}

The evidence-based analysis included only studies based on repeated tDCS sessions with sham tDCS control procedure; 25 patients or more having received active treatment was required for Class I, while a lower number of 10-24 patients was accepted for Class II studies. Current evidence does not allow making any recommendation of Level A (definite efficacy) for any indication. Level B recommendation (probable efficacy) is proposed for: (i) anodal tDCS of the left primary motor cortex (M1) (with right orbitofrontal cathode) in fibromyalgia; (ii) anodal tDCS of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (with right orbitofrontal cathode) in major depressive episode without drug resistance; (iii) anodal tDCS of the right DLPFC (with left DLPFC cathode) in addiction/craving. Level C recommendation (possible efficacy) is proposed for anodal tDCS of the left M1 (or contralateral to pain side, with right orbitofrontal cathode) in chronic lower limb neuropathic pain secondary to spinal cord lesion. Conversely, Level B recommendation (probable inefficacy) is conferred on the absence of clinical effects of: (i) anodal tDCS of the left temporal cortex (with right orbitofrontal cathode) in tinnitus; (ii) anodal tDCS of the left DLPFC (with right orbitofrontal cathode) in drug-resistant major depressive episode. It remains to be clarified whether the probable or possible therapeutic effects of tDCS are clinically meaningful and how to optimally perform tDCS in a therapeutic setting. In addition, the easy management and low cost of tDCS devices allow at home use by the patient, but this might raise ethical and legal concerns with regard to potential misuse or overuse. We must be careful to avoid inappropriate applications of this technique by ensuring rigorous training of the professionals and education of the patients.\n## Response:\n"}

In this document, the IWGDF Practical Guidelines, we describe the basic principles of prevention, classification, and treatment of diabetic foot disease, based on the six IWGDF Guideline chapters. We also describe the organizational levels to successfully prevent and treat diabetic foot disease according to these principles and provide addenda to assist with foot screening. The information in these practical guidelines is aimed at the global community of health care professionals who are involved in the care of persons with diabetes. Many studies around the world support our belief that implementing these prevention and management principles is associated with a decrease in the frequency of diabetes-related lower extremity amputations. We hope that these updated practical guidelines continue to serve as reference document to aid health care providers in reducing the global burden of diabetic foot disease.\n## Response:\n"}

The authors conducted a cross-sectional study of access to care and its association with health-related quality of life among 205 persons of low income infected with the human immunodeficiency virus with constitutional symptoms and/or diarrhea at one public and one Veterans Administration hospital, using a 9-item measure of perceived access and a 55-item health-related quality of life instrument. Problems with access were widespread: 55% traveled for longer than 30 minutes to their usual source of care (compared with 9% to 12% of general populations in national surveys), 49% had problems meeting costs of care, and 48% had problems with clinic hours (compared with 23% in national surveys). In multivariate analyses, uninsured patients reported worse access than patients with Medicaid or Veterans Administration insurance, particularly for meeting the cost of care (P < 0.01). Adjusted health-related quality of life scores in this sample were far lower (by about 1 SD) than those of subjects in a large national acquired immune deficiency syndrome clinical trial. For 8 of 11 health-related quality of life subscales, worse perceived access was significantly (P < 0.05) associated with poorer health-related quality of life, even after controlling for T-4 lymphocyte count, symptoms and other factors. Access and health-related quality of life measures similar to those used in this study may prove useful in future evaluations of medical care systems serving poor, clinically ill populations infected with human immunodeficiency virus.\n## Response:\n"}

Chronic wound formation is linked to age and diabetes and frequently leads to major limb amputation. Here we identify a strategy to reverse fibroblast senescence and improve healing rates. In healthy skin, fibronectin activates Rac1 in fibroblasts, causing migration into the wound bed, and driving wound contraction. We discover that mechanical stimulation of the skin with ultrasound can overturn healing defects by activating a calcium/CamKinaseII/Tiam1/Rac1 pathway that substitutes for fibronectin-dependent signaling and promotes fibroblast migration. Treatment of diabetic and aged mice recruits fibroblasts to the wound bed and reduces healing times by 30%, restoring healing rates to those observed in young, healthy animals. Ultrasound treatment is equally effective in rescuing the healing defects of animals lacking fibronectin receptors, and can be blocked by pharmacological inhibition of the CamKinaseII pathway. Finally, we discover that the migration defects of fibroblasts from human venous leg ulcer patients can be reversed by ultrasound, demonstrating that the approach is applicable to human chronic samples. By demonstrating that this alternative Rac1 pathway can substitute for that normally operating in the skin, we identify future opportunities for management of chronic wounds.\n## Response:\n"}

Subjects' previous oral anti hyperglycemic medication (sulfonylurea and/or metformin) was continued throughout the study. Fasting blood samples were obtained at weeks -5, -1, 0, 1, 4, 8, and 12. The primary efficacy end point was the change in HbA(1c) from baseline to week 12. Secondary end points included changes in fructosamine levels, fasting plasma glucose levels, postprandial glucose level, and meal glucose response (ie, difference between preprandial and postprandial levels), and percent changes in lipid parameters from baseline to week 12.\nRESULTS: The 65 randomized subjects (31 colesevelam, 34 placebo) had a mean age of 56.2 years and a mean body mass index of 32.4 kg/m(2); 55.4% were male and 53.8% were white. The difference in least squares (LS) mean (SE) change in HbA(1c) between the colesevelam group and the placebo group was -0.5% (0.18) (P = 0.007). In subjects with a baseline HbAIc > or = 8.0%, the difference in LS mean change in HbA(1c) was -1.0% (0.27) (P = 0.002). Relative to placebo, colesevelam treatment was associated with reductions in levels of fructosamine (-29.0 [10.9] pmol/L; P = 0.011) and postprandial glucose (-31.5 [13.6] mg/dL; P = 0.026). The mean percent change in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was -9.6% in the colesevelam group, compared with 2.1% in the placebo group (treatment difference, -11.7% [4.2]; P = 0.007); the respective mean percent changes in total cholesterol were -4.0% and 3.4% (treatment difference, -7.3% [3.0]; P = 0.019). Colesevelam also was associated with significant decreases in the percent change in apolipoprotein B (P = 0.003) and low-density lipoprotein particle concentration (P = 0.037). The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was similar in both groups, although treatment-related adverse events were more frequent in the colesevelam group than in the placebo group (29.0% vs 8.8%, respectively). The most frequent TEAEs in the colesevelam group were gastrointestinal disorders (22.6%), primarily constipation (19.4%), compared with an 8.8% incidence of gastrointestinal disorders (0% constipation) in the placebo group. There were no significant changes in body weight or the occurrence of hypoglycemia between treatment groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: In these subjects with type 2 diabetes, 12 weeks of colesevelam treatment were associated with significant reductions in HbA(1c) and in fructosamine and postprandial glucose levels compared with placebo. The 2 groups had a similar adverse-event profile, with the exception of an increased incidence of constipation in the colesevelam group. These results suggest that colesevelam may improve both lipid control and glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes receiving oral antihyperglycemic medications.\n## Response:\n"}

Untreated GER has been postulated to be a cause of inadequate asthma control in children despite inhaled corticosteroid treatment, but it is not known whether treatment with proton pump inhibitors improves asthma control.\nOBJECTIVE: To determine whether lansoprazole is effective in reducing asthma symptoms in children without overt GER.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Study of Acid Reflux in Children With Asthma, a randomized, masked, placebo-controlled, parallel clinical trial that compared lansoprazole with placebo in children with poor asthma control who were receiving inhaled corticosteroid treatment. Three hundred six participants enrolled from April 2007 to September 2010 at 19 US academic clinical centers were followed up for 24 weeks. A subgroup had an esophageal pH study before randomization.\nINTERVENTION: Participating children were randomly assigned to receive either lansoprazole, 15 mg/d if weighing less than 30 kg or 30 mg/d if weighing 30 kg or more (n = 149), or placebo (n = 157).\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was change in Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) score (range, 0-6; a 0.5-unit change is considered clinically meaningful). Secondary outcome measures included lung function measures, asthma-related quality of life, and episodes of poor asthma control.\nRESULTS: The mean age was 11 years (SD, 3 years). The mean difference in change (lansoprazole minus placebo) in the ACQ score was 0.2 units (95% CI, 0.0-0.3 units). There were no statistically significant differences in the mean difference in change for the secondary outcomes of forced expiratory volume in the first second (0.0 L; 95% CI, -0.1 to 0.1 L), asthma-related quality of life (-0.1; 95% CI, -0.3 to 0.1), or rate of episodes of poor asthma control (relative risk, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.9-1.5). Among the 115 children with esophageal pH studies, the prevalence of GER was 43%. In the subgroup with a positive pH study, no treatment effect for lansoprazole vs placebo was observed for any asthma outcome. Children treated with lansoprazole reported more respiratory infections (relative risk, 1.3 [95% CI, 1.1-1.6]).\nCONCLUSION: In this trial of children with poorly controlled asthma without symptoms of GER who were using inhaled corticosteroids, the addition of lansoprazole, compared with placebo, improved neither symptoms nor lung function but was associated with increased adverse events.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00442013.\n## Response:\n"}

Baseline and 28 days of treatment\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinitis, especially when persistent (PER) and associated with asthma heavily impairs patients' quality of life (QoL).\nOBJECTIVE: This study assessed the effect of mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS) on the QoL of patients with PER and asthma, using the Rhinasthma questionnaire (EUDRACT n. 2007-004683-45).\nMETHODS: Patients with moderate/severe PER and intermittent asthma were randomized to MFNS (alcohol-free) 200 \u03bcg/day or placebo for 28 days. Rhinasthma was completed at baseline and at weeks 2 and 4. The total five symptom score (T5SS) for rhinitis, the asthma symptom score and the sum of the two [global symptoms score (GSS)] were recorded daily. The primary outcome was the change in the Rhinasthma global summary (GS) at the end of treatment. Secondary end-points were (a) the change from baseline to end of treatment of each Rhinasthma factor: upper airways (UAs), lower airways (LAs) and respiratory allergy impact; (b) the change from baseline to end of treatment of the T5SS and of the GSS and (c) the use of rescue medication.\nRESULTS: Fifty-two adults were randomized. Compared with placebo, MFNS produced a significant change in the Rhinasthma GS (-10.4 vs. 0.4; P<0.01). MFNS also achieved a significant improvement of the UA (-16.6 vs. 0.1; P<0.001), LA (-10.8 vs. 1.1; P<0.001) and GSS (-6.7 vs. -3.1; P=0.019). The change of the T5SS was greater in the MFNS group but did not reach statistical significance.\nCONCLUSION: In patients with PER rhinitis and intermittent asthma, MFNS improves the QoL and the burden of respiratory symptoms. Treating rhinitis may affect the asthma-related QoL.\n## Response:\n"}

Psychomotor functioning and alertness were assessed through several measures, including the Choice Reaction Time (CRT) test from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. Sedative effects were examined via spontaneously reported adverse events of sedation, somnolence, and hypersomnia as well as fatigue and lethargy, and with two validated subject- and observer-rated sleepiness scales. Standard efficacy measures for ADHD also were included. Cardiovascular and laboratory parameters were assessed.\nRESULTS: There were no significant differences between the GXR and placebo groups on measures of psychomotor functioning or alertness from the CRT at endpoint (least-square mean difference: 2.5 [95% confidence interval (CI): -22.9, 28.0], p\u2009=\u20090.8 for CRT; 2.5 [95% CI: -21.5, 26.4], p\u2009=\u20090.84 for correct responses; 15.5 [95% CI: -45.1, 14.1], p\u2009=\u20090.30 for movement time; and -8.2 [95% CI: -54.1, 37.6] p\u2009=\u20090.72 for total time). Most sedative adverse events were mild to moderate, occurred during dose titration, decreased with dose maintenance, and resolved during the study period. One subject in the GXR group discontinued due to fatigue and somnolence. GXR was not associated with increased daytime sleepiness. GXR treatment was associated with significant improvement in ADHD symptoms (6.3 [95% CI: 2.7, 9.8], p\u2009=\u20090.001 for ADHD Rating Scale IV total scores at endpoint).\nCONCLUSIONS: At doses that resulted in significant improvement in ADHD symptoms, impairment on cognitive tasks was not observed. Daytime sleepiness did not differ with GXR compared with placebo. Results suggest that the beneficial effects of GXR on ADHD symptoms are independent of sedation.\n## Response:\n"}

An expected average of 10 minutes after the technique.\nAbstract: UNLABELLED: Ultrasound (US) is widely used in rheumatology to study and guide injection of peripheral joints. It can also provide useful information about the anatomy of the lumbar spine. Studies have shown that US examination of the spine was a useful tool to help perform epidural anaesthesia. The purpose of the study was to determine if the selection of the optimum puncture level by US may facilitate epidural steroid injection in case of presumed difficult puncture (BMI>30 kg/m(2), age>60 years or lumbar scoliosis).\nMETHODS: We performed a prospective randomized controlled study. Eighty patients were randomized in two groups: US group (n=40) which underwent a pre-procedure spinal US to determine the optimal lumbar level for injection or control group (n=40) for which the level of injection was determined by palpation. Primary endpoint was the pain during the procedure assessed using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).\nRESULTS: We found a positive correlation between depth of the epidural space and BMI (P<0.001) and a negative correlation between size of the interspinous spaces and age (P<0.01). Visibility of the epidural space was not altered by obesity or age. We observed a trend toward a reduction in pain intensity during the procedure in the US group compared to the control group with a mean difference at -0.94 [-1.90; 0.02] but the difference was not significant (P=0.054).\nCONCLUSION: US of the lumbar spine was feasible in patients with lumbar conditions even in obese and old ones and allowed the visualization of the epidural space. However, pre-procedure US examination did not reduce pain during the procedure.\n## Response:\n"}

Subjects evaluated morning instantaneous TOSSs and daily reflective TOSSs, total nasal symptom scores (TNSSs; both instantaneous TNSSs and reflective TNSSs, respectively), and individual ocular and nasal symptoms. Mean changes from baseline averaged over days 2 to 15 (instantaneous) and days 1 to 15 (reflective) were calculated. Quality of life was assessed by using the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire.\nRESULTS: MFNS treatment yielded significant reductions from baseline versus placebo in instantaneous TOSSs (-0.34, P = .026, coprimary end point), instantaneous TNSSs (-0.88, P < .001, coprimary end point), reflective TOSSs (-0.44, P = .005), and reflective TNSSs (-1.06, P < .001). Significant decreases in all individual reflective ocular symptoms and instantaneous eye itching/burning and eye watering/tearing were observed for MFNS versus placebo (P < .05). Numeric improvements in instantaneous eye redness were seen but did not reach statistical significance. Improvements in Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire total scores and individual symptom domains were achieved with MFNS treatment versus placebo (P < .001).

Programs funded by the federal Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act not only provide essential medical care for these individuals but also facilitate access to medical care services. These programmes fund services, including case management, transportation, and translation assistance, that feature ongoing assistance and enable individuals to remain in the health care system. Because of the importance of maintaining the strict drug regimen, retention in care is also an important part of the overall HIV care component. This study analyzed the relationship of ancillary services and a federal health programme client's receipt of medical care and retention in the health care system. We defined a cohort in need of ancillary services in part by a questionnaire designed to identify factors relating to need. These factors included education, language, and substance use. By merging client level data files we were able to identify medical service utilization trends among the individuals in the cohort who received a high number of ancillary services (more than 11 ancillary service visits in the two-year study period, n = 138) and those who received few services (fewer than six ancillary service visits in the two-year study period, n = 132). Results suggest that the receipt of ancillary services is associated with receipt of and retention in primary medical care. We found that for federal health programme clients in need of ancillary services, a positive relationship existed between their receipt of ancillary services and their access to primary medical care (p </= 0.001). This observation held constant when age, race, gender, and insurance coverage were controlled for. Also, these clients were more likely to be seen by a medical doctor at least once in three consecutive six-month periods when they received needed ancillary services (p </= 0.01).\n## Response:\n"}

Other endpoints included incidence of nocturia and urgency, overall bladder condition (OBC), daytime frequency, Incontinence Quality of Life (I-QOL), Patient's Global Impression of Change (PGIC) and volume voided. The primary endpoint showed little difference between Sativex and placebo. Four out of seven secondary endpoints were significantly in favour of Sativex: number of episodes of nocturia (adjusted mean difference -0.28, p = 0.010), OBC (-1.16, p = 0.001), number of voids/day (-0.85, p = 0.001) and PGIC (p = 0.005). Of the other endpoints, number of daytime voids was statistically significantly in favour of Sativex (-0.57, p = 0.044). The improvement in I-QOL was in favour of Sativex but did not reach statistical significance.\nCONCLUSIONS: Although the primary endpoint did not reach statistical significance, we conclude that Sativex did have some impact on the symptoms of overactive bladder in patients with MS, providing evidence of some improvement in symptoms associated with bladder dysfunction in these subjects.\n## Response:\n"}

The objective of this study was to describe the occurrence of fever in the critically ill and assess its effect on ICU outcome.\nDESIGN: Retrospective cohort. Fever was defined by temperature > or = 38.3 degrees C and high fever by > or = 39.5 degrees C.\nSETTING: Calgary Health Region during 2000-2006.\nPATIENTS: All adults (> or = 18 yrs) admitted to ICUs.\nINTERVENTIONS: None.\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 24,204 ICU admission episodes occurred among 20,466 patients; 35% were classified as medical, 33% as cardiac surgical, 16% as other surgical, and 15% as trauma/neurologic. The cumulative incidence of fever and high fever was 44% and 8% and the incidence density was 24.3 and 2.7 per 100 days of ICU admission, respectively. The incidence density of fever was higher in trauma/neuro patients, males, younger patients, and was lower in those with admission Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores > or = 25. Seventeen percent and 31% of patients with fever and high fever had associated positive cultures. Resolution of fever and high fever occurred in 27% and 53% of patients before ICU discharge and prolonged fever and high fever lasting for 5 or more days in the ICU occurred in 18% and 11% of febrile patients, respectively. Although the presence of fever was not associated with increased ICU mortality (13% vs. 12%; p = .08), high fever was associated with significantly increased risk for death (20.3% vs. 12%, p < .0001). After controlling for confounding factors using multivariable logistic regression models, the influence of fever on the ICU mortality varied significantly according to its timing of onset, degree, and main admission category.\nCONCLUSIONS: Fever is common in patients admitted to the ICU and its occurrence and impact on outcome varies among defined patient populations.\n## Response:\n"}

Statistically significant relative decrease (62%P = 0.001) in the incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting was seen in those treated with dexamethasone. Statistically significant relative decrease (23%P = 0.016) in post-operative pain scores for the day of operation was seen in those treated with dexamethasone. Significant decrease (17.5%, P < 0.001) in mean pain score for seven post-operative days was seen in those treated with dexamethasone. No adverse effects were seen.\nCONCLUSIONS: Dexamethasone given as a single dose of 10 mg at induction of anaesthesia for adult tonsillectomy is an effective, safe and inexpensive method for reducing morbidity in adult tonsillectomy.\n## Response:\n"}

Gardening and healthy eating are priorities in the Navajo Nation. Collaborations between researchers and local partners supported the design and implementation of this project.\nDESIGN: The Y\u00e9ego! Healthy Eating and Gardening Study was a group-randomized controlled trial to evaluate a school-based healthy eating and gardening intervention in 6 schools in the Navajo Nation. Schools were randomized 1:2 to intervention or comparison.\nSETTING/PARTICIPANTS: The Shiprock and Tsaile/Chinle areas in the Navajo Nation were selected. Elementary schools were screened for eligibility. All students in third and fourth grades were invited to participate in the assessments.\nINTERVENTION: Delivered during 1 school year in the intervention schools, the intervention included a culturally relevant nutrition and gardening curriculum and a school garden.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Student self-efficacy for eating fruits and vegetables, student self-efficacy for gardening, and student healthy foods score from a modified Alternative Healthy Eating Index were assessed in third and fourth graders at the beginning and end of a school year affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Primary analyses used repeated measures linear mixed models accounting for students nested within schools to estimate the intervention effect and 95% CIs.\nRESULTS: Students in the intervention schools had self-efficacy scores for eating fruits and vegetables that were 0.22 points greater (95% CI=0.04, 0.41) than those in the comparison schools, although the student healthy foods score increased in the intervention schools by 2.0 (95% CI=0.4, 3.6); the differential change was modest at 1.7 (95% CI=-0.3, 3.7). The self-efficacy to grow fruits and vegetables in the school garden increased among those in the intervention schools (OR=1.92; 95% CI=1.02, 3.63) but not significantly more than it increased in the comparison schools (OR=1.29; 95% CI=0.60, 2.81).\nCONCLUSIONS: The intervention was efficacious in improving self-efficacy for eating fruits and vegetables among third- and fourth-grade students over a school year. The findings warrant further evaluation of the intervention in larger-group randomized trials with schools in Navajo communities.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov NCT03778021.\n## Response:\n"}

This study investigated whether cigarette demand predicted response to contingent monetary rewards for abstinence among individuals with substance use disorders. It also sought to replicate evidence for greater price sensitivity at whole-dollar pack price transitions (ie, left-digit effects).\nMETHODS: Participants (N = 338) were individuals in residential substance use disorder treatment who participated in a randomized controlled trial that compared contingent vouchers to noncontingent vouchers for smoking abstinence. Baseline demand indices were used to predict number of abstinent days during the 14-day voucher period (after the reduction lead-in) and at 1 and 3 months afterward.\nRESULTS: Demand indices correlated with measures of smoking and nicotine dependence. As measured by elasticity, intensity and O max, higher demand significantly predicted fewer abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings during voucher period for individuals in the noncontingent vouchers condition. Breakpoint exhibited a trend-level association with abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings. Demand indices did not predict abstinence in the contingent vouchers group, and did not predict abstinence at 1- and 3-month follow-ups. Left-digit price transitions were associated with significantly greater reductions in consumption.\nCONCLUSIONS: The association of cigarette demand with smoking behavior only in the group for whom abstinence was not incentivized indicates that CPT assesses the value of smoking more than the value of money per se and that vouchers counteract the effects of the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes. Results provide initial short-term evidence of predictive validity for the CPT indices.\nIMPLICATIONS: This study provides the first evidence of the validity of the CPT for predicting early response to brief advice for smoking cessation plus nicotine replacement in smokers with substance dependence. However, demand for cigarettes did not predict voucher-based treatment response, indicating that incentives serve as a powerful motivator not to smoke that acts in opposition to the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes and that the indices reflect the value of smoking more than the value of money per se.\n## Response:\n"}

The NPI uses a screening strategy to minimize administration time, examining and scoring only those behavioral domains with positive responses to screening questions. Both the frequency and the severity of each behavior are determined. Information for the NPI is obtained from a caregiver familiar with the patient's behavior. Studies reported here demonstrate the content and concurrent validity as well as between-rater, test-retest, and internal consistency reliability; the instrument is both valid and reliable. The NPI has the advantages of evaluating a wider range of psychopathology than existing instruments, soliciting information that may distinguish among different etiologies of dementia, differentiating between severity and frequency of behavioral changes, and minimizing administration time.\n## Response:\n"}

Study Design Prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Setting Sixty-nine secondary and tertiary sites in North America, Europe, and Asia. Subjects and Methods In total, 343 subjects with persistent acute tinnitus after traumatic cochlear injury or otitis media were randomized to receive 3 intratympanic doses of either AM-101 0.87 mg/mL or placebo over 3 to 5 days. They were followed for 84 days. The primary safety end point was the incidence of a clinically meaningful hearing deterioration from baseline to study day 35. Further safety assessments included tympanic membrane closure rates, analysis of adverse events, hematology, blood chemistry, and vital signs. In addition, data were collected on applied anesthetics and injection techniques. Results The treatment was well tolerated, with no intervention-related serious adverse events. The incidence of clinically meaningful hearing deterioration was low, comparable between treatment groups ( P = .82 for the primary safety end point) and not different between treated and untreated ears in unilaterally treated subjects. The rate of treatment and procedure-related adverse events was similar among treatment groups. The tympanic membrane was closed in 92% of subjects within 1 week and in all subjects by study day 84. Blood values and vital signs were inconspicuous. Conclusion Repeated intratympanic injections of AM-101 over a 3- to 5-day period appear to be safe and well tolerated, demonstrating the ability to potentially use this delivery approach over longer time periods.\n## Response:\n"}

Information was collected on study characteristics, cost effectiveness of treatment alternatives, and methodological quality.\nRESULTS: A total of 14 randomised controlled trials were included. The quality of economic evaluations and the risk of bias varied considerably between trials. Four studies showed incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) below the willingness-to-pay threshold. Few studies seemed to evaluate interventions that successfully changed adherence.\nCONCLUSIONS: Only 14 randomised controlled trials examined the cost effectiveness of adherence interventions. Despite that some studies showe favourable ICERs, the overall quality of studies was modest and the economic perspectives applied were frequently narrow. To demonstrate that adherence interventions can be cost effective, we recommend that proven-effective adherence programmes are subjected to comprehensive economic evaluations.\n## Response:\n"}

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of dupilumab (SAR231893/REGN668), a fully human monoclonal antibody to the alpha subunit of the interleukin-4 receptor, in patients with persistent, moderate-to-severe asthma and elevated eosinophil levels.\nMETHODS: We enrolled patients with persistent, moderate-to-severe asthma and a blood eosinophil count of at least 300 cells per microliter or a sputum eosinophil level of at least 3% who used medium-dose to high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids plus long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs). We administered dupilumab (300 mg) or placebo subcutaneously once weekly. Patients were instructed to discontinue LABAs at week 4 and to taper and discontinue inhaled glucocorticoids during weeks 6 through 9. Patients received the study drug for 12 weeks or until a protocol-defined asthma exacerbation occurred. The primary end point was the occurrence of an asthma exacerbation; secondary end points included a range of measures of asthma control. Effects on various type 2 helper T-cell (Th2)-associated biomarkers and safety and tolerability were also evaluated.\nRESULTS: A total of 52 patients were assigned to the dupilumab group, and 52 patients were assigned to the placebo group. Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. Three patients had an asthma exacerbation with dupilumab (6%) versus 23 with placebo (44%), corresponding to an 87% reduction with dupilumab (odds ratio, 0.08; 95% confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.28; P<0.001). Significant improvements were observed for most measures of lung function and asthma control. Dupilumab reduced biomarkers associated with Th2-driven inflammation. Injection-site reactions, nasopharyngitis, nausea, and headache occurred more frequently with dupilumab than with placebo.\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with persistent, moderate-to-severe asthma and elevated eosinophil levels who used inhaled glucocorticoids and LABAs, dupilumab therapy, as compared with placebo, was associated with fewer asthma exacerbations when LABAs and inhaled glucocorticoids were withdrawn, with improved lung function and reduced levels of Th2-associated inflammatory markers.

We present successful strategies to overcome the following barriers during the Women's Recovery Group (WRG) two-site clinical trial (N\u2009=\u2009158): maintenance of sample size and balanced gender randomization during continuous enrollment, maintenance of group attendance, and training and retention of therapists over the 24-month continuous group enrollment.\nMETHODS: To increase recruitment, we targeted referral sources yielding the highest enrollment conversion at each site. Group sessions were consistently held regardless of group size. Therapists were trained in two teams allowing for coverage and uninterrupted treatment over 24 months.\nRESULTS: At both sites recruitment and enrollment increased with each successive quarter. Sample size and end date targets were met without disruptions in treatment. Group therapists reported high satisfaction with their training and treatment experiences.\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: These strategies supported targeted enrollment and study duration, stability of open-enrollment group therapy frame, and therapist retention and satisfaction.\nSCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: Applying these strategies can aid in providing evidence-based group therapy in both clinical and research settings.\n## Response:\n"}

The relationship between the frequency of church attendance and the mother-daughter relationship was also explored. A correlational analysis was conducted on 101 African-American adolescents and their maternalfigures recruitedfrom middle schools. Girls completed the Maternal Bonding, Mother-Adolescent Communication, and Maternal Monitoring scales while maternalfigures completed the parent versions of the Mother-Adolescent Communication and Monitoring Scales. The findings revealed that maternal monitoring, as perceived by girls and mothers, is related to increased communication between mothers and daughters. Greater church attendance was related to greater perceived maternal bonding for girls. We recommend that nurses use strategies to enhance communication between girls and their maternalfigures and to increase maternal monitoring of daughters' behavior to reduce health risk behaviors among African-American girls.\n## Response:\n"}

In vitro, GMP-140 mediates activated platelet adhesion to neutrophils (PMN) and monocytes, causing the formation of leukocyte-platelet conjugates. Using a newly developed assay that measures the percentage of circulating leukocyte-platelet conjugates in whole blood, we studied 17 patients undergoing CPB and have determined that (1) monocyte-platelet conjugates increased significantly during CPB, from 18% +/- 1.5% to 44% +/- 4.5% (mean +/- SEM) by the end of CPB, while PMN-platelet conjugates increased only slightly and lymphocyte-platelet conjugates decreased; (2) the time course of the increase in monocyte- and PMN-platelet conjugates paralleled that of the increase in circulating activated platelets, as determined by the presence of surface GMP-140; and (3) monocyte activation, as assessed by increased surface expression of CD11b, showed a gradual increase similar to the increase in monocyte-platelet conjugates, while PMN surface CD11b peaked immediately after the start of CPB. We conclude that CPB, through increased platelet GMP-140 expression, causes formation of monocyte-platelet, and to a lesser extent, PMN-platelet conjugates. The activation of monocytes and PMN on CPB, as evidenced by CD11b expression, occurs with differing time courses.\n## Response:\n"}

An in-office, minimally invasive procedure addressing dynamic NVC uses a bioabsorbable implant (Latera) to support the lateral nasal wall. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the treatment in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with sham control.\nMETHODS: In this prospective, multicenter, single-blinded RCT, 137 patients from 10 clinics were randomized into 2 arms: treatment arm (70 patients) and sham control arm (67 patients). Outcome measures were followed through 3 months after the procedure. The primary endpoint was the responder rate (percentage of patients with reduction in clinical severity by \u22651 category or \u226520% reduction in Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation [NOSE] score).\nRESULTS: Before the procedure, there were no statistically significant differences in patient demographics and nasal obstruction symptom measures between the 2 arms. Three months after the procedure, responder rate was significantly higher for the treatment arm compared to the control (82.5% vs 54.7%, p = 0.001). Patients in the treatment arm also had a significantly greater decrease in NOSE score (-42.4 \u00b1 23.4 vs -22.7 \u00b1 27.9, p < 0.0001) and significantly lower visual analogue scale (VAS) scores (-39.0 \u00b1 29.7 vs -13.3 \u00b1 30.0, p < 0.0001) than the sham control arm. Seventeen patients reported 19 procedure/implant-related adverse events, all of which resolved with no clinical sequelae.\nCONCLUSION: Our study shows the safety and effectiveness of the bioabsorbable implant in reducing patients' nasal obstruction symptoms.\n## Response:\n"}

Sleep outcomes (sleep onset latency, total wake time, wake after sleep onset, sleep efficiency, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) were compared between CBTI and control at 6 months using repeated-measures analysis of variance adjusted for baseline values. AHI of 5 or greater versus less than 5 was included as an interaction term to evaluate changes in sleep outcomes. The number of participants at baseline and 6 months with mild SDB for whom insomnia was their only other indication for PAP was also compared between CBTI and control.\nRESULTS: AHI status (AHI \u2265 5 [75.5% of participants] versus AHI < 5) did not moderate improvements in sleep associated with CBTI (all p values \u2265 .12). Nine (45.0%) of 20 participants with mild SDB for whom insomnia was their only other indication for PAP therapy at baseline no longer had another indication for PAP at 6 months, with no significant difference between CBTI and control.\nCONCLUSIONS: CBTI improves sleep in older veterans with insomnia and untreated mild SDB. Larger trials are needed to assess whether CBTI reduces the number of patients with mild SDB eligible for PAP.\n## Response:\n"}

Earlier research on antivirals suggests that patient attitudes toward a medication or treatment play an important role in influencing its use. Attitudes toward PIs were explored using data from a study of late middle-aged and older adults (ages 50-67) living with HIV/AIDS (N = 38) who had been or were currently users of PIs at the time of accrual in late 1997. Comparisons were made between African American and White men with regard to perceptions of: medication efficacy, self-efficacy, physician competence, quality of life, side effects, skipping medication doses and the timing of protease initiation. Results of these analyses suggest significant differences between White and African American men. African American men not only expressed significantly more doubt regarding their ability to utilize PIs and adhere to PI treatment regimens than Whites, but also reported significantly more doubt regarding physician competence with regard to PIs. African American men were also more likely than Whites to question the timing of their initiation of treatment with PIs. The findings suggest that these racial differences may be important for creating patient education strategies and the targeting of non-adherence prevention efforts.\n## Response:\n"}

This study evaluated a telehealth application to support family dementia caregivers providing homecare. We explored feasibility of in-home video monitoring and feedback to help caregivers and reduce caregiving burden. A caregiver-patient dyad was recruited from a Midwestern University Alzheimer's Disease Center. The caregiver triggered video recordings on a laptop computer using a remote control that also recorded 5 min prior to pressing \"record.\" Recordings were automatically uploaded via the Internet for interdisciplinary team review and feedback. Issues related to Internet transfer and storage of health information and computer security were addressed. Professionals reported the value of video recordings for identifying antecedents and evaluating caregiver responses. The caregiver reported improved communication and behavior management and ease of use.

The primary outcome was the change from baseline to cycle 6 for all indices.\nRESULTS: All parameters were similar at baseline between the two groups. Over six cycles, NOMAC/E2 had less effect on most haemostatic indices than LNG/EE. Lipids were essentially unchanged with NOMAC/E2, whereas with LNG/EE high-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides slightly increased. NOMAC/E2 induced negligible changes in glucose and insulin parameters, in contrast to LNG/EE. A much smaller increase in CRP was observed with NOMAC/E2 than with LNG/EE.

This study evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of omalizumab in patients with poorly controlled, moderate-to-severe allergic asthma.\nMETHODS: This was a randomized, open-label, multicentre, parallel-group study. A total of 312 patients (12-73 years) receiving >/=400 microg/day (adolescent) or >/=800 microg/day (adult) inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate, or equivalent were included. Patients received best standard care (BSC) with or without omalizumab [at least 0.016 mg/kg/IgE (IU/ml) every 4 weeks] for 12 months.\nRESULTS: The annualized mean number of asthma deterioration-related incidents was reduced from 9.76 with BSC alone (n = 106) to 4.92 per patient-year with omalizumab (n = 206) (P < 0.001). Mean clinically significant asthma exacerbation rates were 2.86 and 1.12 per patient-year, respectively (P < 0.001). Omalizumab-treated patients (41.4%) required rescue medication <1 day/week compared with 20.7% for BSC alone (P < 0.001). Omalizumab improved absolute forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) compared with BSC alone (2.48 and 2.28 l, respectively; P < 0.05) and reduced symptom scores relative to BSC alone (decrease of 6.5 and 0.7 respectively; P < 0.001). Omalizumab was well-tolerated.\nCONCLUSIONS: Omalizumab administered as add-on therapy to BSC benefits patients with poorly controlled, moderate-to-severe allergic asthma.\n## Response:\n"}

We hypothesized that supplementation for 28 wk with a commercially available encapsulated juice powder concentrate (JPC) could influence indicators of oxidative stress, immunity, and illness. Trained men (n = 41; 34 +/- 5 y; maximum oxygen uptake = 55 +/- 7 mL x kg(-1) x min(-1)) from a homogenous police Special Forces unit were randomly assigned in a double blind manner to either JPC (n = 21) or placebo (n = 20). We used multiple 7-d food records to assess dietary intake and found inadequate mean daily fruit and vegetable consumption (3.2 +/- 1.2 servings). The group physician documented all duty days lost due to illness. We collected plasma at baseline and study wk 4, 8, 16, and 28 for analysis of carbonyl groups on protein (CP) and TNFalpha. Over the 28-wk investigation, CP was lower in the JPC group, with both a treatment and a time x treatment interaction (P < 0.05). Concentrations of both CP and TNFalpha at 16 and 28 wk were lower in the JPC than in the placebo group (P < 0.001). TNFalpha increased during the first 8 wk followed by a decrease in both groups for the following 20 wk (P < 0.001). Over the final 20 wk of the study, the placebo group tended to have more days of illness than the JPC group (P = 0.068). These data suggest beneficial JPC effects with regard to reduction of duty days lost due to illness and reduction of CP and TNFalpha concentrations in this group of trained men over 28 wk.\n## Response:\n"}

It is unclear whether an adjunctive use of IPC would result in a lower incidence of postoperative venous thrombosis.\nMETHODS: We randomly assigned patients who underwent major surgery and had a Caprini score of \u226511 to receive either IPC in addition to standard prophylaxis with anti-embolic stockings (pressure of 18-21\u200amm Hg at the ankle) and low-molecular-weight heparin (IPC group) or standard prophylaxis alone (control group). The primary outcome was an asymptomatic venous thrombosis of the lower limbs, as detected by duplex ultrasound scan performed before inclusion and every 3-5 days after surgery.\nRESULTS: A total of 407 patients underwent randomization, of which 204 were assigned to the IPC group and 203 to the control group. The primary outcome occurred in 1 (0.5%) patient in the IPC group and 34 (16.7%) patients in the control group [relative risk, 0.03, 95% confidential interval (CI): 0.01-0.21]. Pulmonary embolism occurred in none of the 204 patients in the IPC group and in 5 (2.5%) patients in the control group (relative risk, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01-1.63), and postoperative death occurred in 6 (2.9%) patients in the IPC group and 10 (4.9%) in the control group (relative risk, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.50-1.60).\nCONCLUSIONS: Among patients with a Caprini score of \u226511 who received standard prophylaxis for VTE, adjunctive IPC resulted in a significantly lower incidence of asymptomatic venous thrombosis.\n## Response:\n"}

Although distress in caregivers is documented, generalization is limited by small sample sizes, restricted range of assessments, and lack of information as to which caregivers may be more vulnerable to distress. The purpose of this study was to describe the peri-transplant psychological status of a sample of caregivers of allogeneic transplant patients.\nMETHODS: We assessed caregiver mood, stress, burden, and sleep using valid self-report measures in 109 caregivers of allogeneic transplant patients prior to stem cell transplantation. Caregivers' scores were compared with norms or established cutoff scores for behavioral measures. Additionally, demographic characteristics such as age and sex were tested as predictors of distress.\nRESULTS: Caregivers showed significant levels of anxiety, stress, intrusion and avoidance behaviors, and poor sleep at the start of transplant compared with established norms. Younger caregivers were more distressed than older caregivers. There were no differences in levels of distress between male and female caregivers.\nCONCLUSION: The peri-transplant period is a time of heightened anxiety and distress for caregivers of allogeneic transplant patients. This study indicates that caregivers would benefit from support programs in the peri-transplant period. Recommendations for types of support that may be helpful to caregivers are provided, but additional research is needed to validate that these programs would help caregivers providing care to patients receiving an allogeneic transplant in the peri-transplant period.\n## Response:\n"}

Therefore, we examined the validity of a brief, new measure of depression severity.\nMEASUREMENTS: The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as \"0\" (not at all) to \"3\" (nearly every day). The PHQ-9 was completed by 6,000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics-gynecology clinics. Construct validity was assessed using the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey, self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (MHP) interview in a sample of 580 patients.\nRESULTS: As PHQ-9 depression severity increased, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and health care utilization increased. Using the MHP reinterview as the criterion standard, a PHQ-9 score > or =10 had a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 88% for major depression. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. Results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics-gynecology samples.\nCONCLUSION: In addition to making criteria-based diagnoses of depressive disorders, the PHQ-9 is also a reliable and valid measure of depression severity. These characteristics plus its brevity make the PHQ-9 a useful clinical and research tool.\n## Response:\n"}

Despite the traditional \"GI cocktail\" (GI indicates gastrointestinal), an intravenous (IV) proton pump inhibitor (PPI), a novel acid-lowering drug, has recently been used to treat this condition. The aim of this study was to evaluate the immediate effect of IV pantoprazole in addition to the conventional GI cocktail in the relief of severe dyspeptic pain.\nMETHODS: This double-blind, randomized, controlled study was conducted in the emergency department of an urban tertiary-care hospital from January 2011 to October 2011. Selected patients with severe dyspeptic pain were randomized to treatment with a placebo, antacid, and antispasmodic (conventional group) or IV pantoprazole, antacid, and antispasmodic (pantoprazole group). The self-reported 100-mm visual analog scale score, adverse effects, and overall satisfaction were evaluated in 15-minute intervals for 60 minutes.\nRESULTS: Eighty-seven eligible cases were enrolled in the study. Forty-four and 43 patients were randomized in the conventional group and pantoprazole group, respectively. There was no difference in the mean 60-minute visual analog scale scores between the treatment groups. The rate of \"responders,\" additional drug use, adverse effects, and patient satisfaction were similar between the groups.\nCONCLUSION: Intravenous PPI provides no additional benefit over the conventional GI cocktail in the relief of acute, severe dyspeptic pain. Because of its neutral effect and higher cost, the use of IV PPI to treat such conditions should be discouraged in general clinical practice.\n## Response:\n"}

In this study, we quantify such costs and evaluate their relationship with sociodemographic factors, including family-reported financial and social hardships.\nMETHODS: This was a cross-sectional analysis of data collected during the Hospital-to-Home Outcomes Study, a randomized trial designed to determine the effects of a nurse home visit after standard pediatric discharge. Parents completed an in-person survey during the child's hospitalization. The survey included sociodemographic characteristics of the parent and child, measures of financial and social hardship, household income and also evaluated the family's total nonmedical cost burden, which was defined as all lost earnings plus expenses. A daily cost burden (DCB) standardized it for a 24-hour period. The daily cost burden as a percentage of daily household income (DCBi) was also calculated.\nRESULTS: Median total cost burden for the 1372 households was $113, the median DCB was $51, and the median DCBi was 45%. DCB and DCBi varied across many sociodemographic characteristics. In particular, single-parent households (those with less work flexibility and more financial hardships experienced significantly higher DCB and DCBi. Those who reported \u22653 financial hardships lost or spent 6-times more of their daily income on nonmedical costs than those without hardships. Those with \u22651 social hardships lost or spent double their daily income compared with those without social hardships.\nCONCLUSIONS: Nonmedical costs place burdens on families of children who are hospitalized, disproportionately affecting those with competing socioeconomic challenges.\n## Response:\n"}

Most food allergy is acquired in the first 1 to 2 years of life, whereas the loss of food allergy is a far more variable process, depending on both the individual child and the specific food allergy. For example, whereas most milk allergy is outgrown over time, most allergies to peanuts and tree nuts are never lost. In addition, whereas some children may lose their milk allergy in a matter of months, the process may take as long as 8 or 10 years in other children. This review provides an overview of the natural history of food allergy and provides specific information on the natural course of the most common childhood food allergies.\n## Response:\n"}

One hundred thirty-eight Black and mixed-race mother-father dyads participated. Coparent dyads were randomly assigned to either a treatment as usual (TAU) group, receiving referrals and navigation support to existing community services (control), or to TAU plus invitation to a series of six dyadic Focused Coparenting Consultation (FCC) sessions led by a male-female mentor team (intervention). Seventy-one percent of those prenatally assessed were later reassessed at 3 months postpartum. Both mothers and fathers contributed reports of coparenting, father engagement, physical and psychological intimate partner violence (IPV), and depressive symptoms. Intent-to-treat analyses indicated: (a) some evidence that mothers in the intervention group reported more positive coparenting communication at 3 months postpartum than did control group mothers; (b) mothers in the intervention group reported significantly more time spent by fathers with the child than did control group mothers; (c) parents in the intervention group had significant reductions in psychological IPV compared to parents in the control group; and (d) both mothers and fathers showed reductions in self-reported depression over time, with no differential impact of group. Findings suggest that the FCC intervention may produce modest but important benefits for unmarried, low-income Black coparents in the transition to parenthood.

Stereotactic body radiotherapy delivers high-dose, ablative radiotherapy. We aimed to compare complete response rates for pain after stereotactic body radiotherapy or conventional external beam radiotherapy in patients with painful spinal metastasis.\nMETHODS: This open-label, multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 2/3 trial was done at 13 hospitals in Canada and five hospitals in Australia. Patients were eligible if they were aged 18 years and older, and had painful (defined as \u22652 points with the Brief Pain Inventory) MRI-confirmed spinal metastasis, no more than three consecutive vertebral segments to be included in the treatment volume, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, a Spinal Instability Neoplasia Score of less than 12, and no neurologically symptomatic spinal cord or cauda equina compression. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) with a web-based, computer-generated allocation sequence to receive either stereotactic body radiotherapy at a dose of 24 Gy in two daily fractions or conventional external beam radiotherapy at a dose of 20 Gy in five daily fractions using standard techniques. Treatment assignment was done centrally by use of a minimisation method to achieve balance for the stratification factors of radiosensitivity, the presence or absence of mass-type tumour (extraosseous or epidural disease extension, or both) on imaging, and centre. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a complete response for pain at 3 months after radiotherapy. The primary endpoint was analysed in the intention-to-treat population and all safety and quality assurance analyses were done in the as-treated population (ie, all patients who received at least one fraction of radiotherapy). The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02512965.\nFINDINGS: Between Jan 4, 2016, and Sept 27, 2019, 229 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive conventional external beam radiotherapy (n=115) or stereotactic body radiotherapy (n=114). All 229 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The median follow-up was 6\u00b77 months (IQR 6\u00b73-6\u00b79). At 3 months, 40 (35%) of 114 patients in the stereotactic body radiotherapy group, and 16 (14%) of 115 patients in the conventional external beam radiotherapy group had a complete response for pain (risk ratio 1\u00b733, 95% CI 1\u00b714-1\u00b755; p=0\u00b70002). This significant difference was maintained in multivariable-adjusted analyses (odds ratio 3\u00b747, 95% CI 1\u00b777-6\u00b780; p=0\u00b70003). The most common grade 3-4 adverse event was grade 3 pain (five [4%] of 115 patients in the conventional external beam radiotherapy group vs five (5%) of 110 patients in the stereotactic body radiotherapy group). No treatment-related deaths were observed.\nINTERPRETATION: Stereotactic body radiotherapy at a dose of 24 Gy in two daily fractions was superior to conventional external beam radiotherapy at a dose of 20 Gy in five daily fractions in improving the complete response rate for pain. These results suggest that use of conformal, image-guided, stereotactically dose-escalated radiotherapy is appropriate in the palliative setting for symptom control for selected patients with painful spinal metastases, and an increased awareness of the need for specialised and multidisciplinary involvement in the delivery of end-of-life care is needed.\nFUNDING: Canadian Cancer Society and the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council.\n## Response:\n"}

Ketamine is a racemic mixture consisting of two enantiomers, R- and S-ketamine. In contrast to ketamine, S-ketamine is reported to be less prone to psychomimetic side effects, such as derealisation and hallucinations. In this report we describe the effect of ketamine and S-ketamine infusion therapy, respectively, in two patients with treatment-resistant major depression. Severity of depression was rated using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). While one patient did not respond to either treatment, in the other patient intravenous administration of ketamine as well as S-ketamine showed an antidepressant effect as assessed by a decrease in HAMD-21 and BDI at days 1 and 3 after infusion which faded until day 6. Both patients experienced psychomimetic side effects during ketamine infusion which were absent during treatment with S-ketamine. We conclude that S-ketamine might exert similar antidepressant effects as ketamine in drug-resistant depression but may be better tolerated by the patients.\n## Response:\n"}

We developed a patient-family agenda setting intervention to engage family in cancer care communication.\nMETHODS: We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial (NCT03283553) of patients on active treatment for breast cancer and their family \"care partner.\" Intervention dyads (n\u2009=\u200969) completed a self-administered checklist to clarify care partner roles, establish a shared visit agenda, and facilitate MyChart patient portal access. Control dyads (n\u2009=\u200963) received usual care. We assessed intervention acceptability and initial effects from post-visit surveys and MyChart utilization at 6\u00a0weeks.\nRESULTS: At baseline, most patients (89.4%) but few care partners (1.5%) were registered for MyChart. Most patients (79.4%) wanted their care partner to have access to their records and 39.4% of care partners reported accessing MyChart. In completing the checklist, patients and care partners endorsed active communication roles for the care partner and identified a similar visit agenda: most (>\u200990%) reported the checklist was easy, useful, and recommended it to others. At 6\u00a0weeks, intervention (vs control) care partners were more likely to be registered for MyChart (75.4% vs 1.6%; p\u2009<\u20090.001), to have logged in (43.5% vs 0%; p\u2009<\u20090.001) and viewed clinical notes (30.4% vs 0%; p\u2009<\u20090.001), but were no more likely to exchange direct messages with clinicians (1.5% vs 0%; p\u2009=\u20090.175). No differences in patients' MyChart use were observed, but intervention patients more often viewed clinical notes (50.7% vs 9.5%; p\u2009<\u20090.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: A patient-family agenda setting intervention was acceptable and affected online practices of cancer patients and care partners.\n## Response:\n"}

We sought to demonstrate that maca root may be an effective treatment for antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction (AISD) in women. Method. We conducted a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of maca root (3.0\u2009g/day) in 45 female outpatients (mean age of 41.5 \u00b1 12.5 years) with SSRI/SNRI-induced sexual dysfunction whose depression remitted. Endpoints were improvement in sexual functioning as per the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX) and the Massachusetts General Hospital Sexual Function Questionnaire (MGH-SFQ). Results. 45 of 57 consented females were randomized, and 42 (30 premenopausal and 12 postmenopausal women) were eligible for a modified intent-to-treat analysis based on having had at least one postmedication visit. Remission rates by the end of treatment were higher for the maca than the placebo group, based on attainment of an ASEX total score \u2264 10 (9.5% for maca versus 4.8% for placebo), attaining an MGH-SFQ score \u2264 12 (30.0% for maca versus 20.0% for placebo) and reaching an MGH-SFQ score \u2264 8 (9.5% for maca versus 5.0% for placebo). Higher remission rates for the maca versus placebo group were associated with postmenopausal status. Maca was well tolerated. Conclusion. Maca root may alleviate SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction in postmenopausal women. This trial is registered with NCT00568126.\n## Response:\n"}

The primary outcome was the change from baseline to cycle 6 for all indices.\nRESULTS: All parameters were similar at baseline between the two groups. Over six cycles, NOMAC/E2 had less effect on most haemostatic indices than LNG/EE. Lipids were essentially unchanged with NOMAC/E2, whereas with LNG/EE high-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides slightly increased. NOMAC/E2 induced negligible changes in glucose and insulin parameters, in contrast to LNG/EE. A much smaller increase in CRP was observed with NOMAC/E2 than with LNG/EE. NOMAC/E2 was associated with a greater increase in SHBG.\nCONCLUSIONS: The monophasic COC NOMAC/E2 had less influence on haemostasis, lipids and carbohydrate metabolism than the COC LNG/EE.\n## Response:\n"}

Disease control was 37.7% for patients on combination (24.8-52.1%) and 43.4% on control (29.8-57.7%). Neither independent nor investigator assessments showed significant differences between study arms. Median progression-free survival was 1.5 months (1.3-2.6) for patients on combination, and 1.9 months (1.5-2.9) on control. The most frequent adverse events in the combination arm were rash (29.6%), acneiform dermatitis (22.2%), and injection site reactions (20.4%). Grade 3/4 dyspnea and hypokalemia were more frequent with cetuximab monotherapy (7.5% and 5.7% vs 1.9% each, respectively), and grade 3/4 respiratory failure and disease progression were more frequent with combination (5.6% each vs 1.9% each).\nCONCLUSION: EMD 1201081 was well tolerated combined with cetuximab, but there was no incremental clinical efficacy.\n## Response:\n"}

Time points of measurement: 24 hours after ROSC.\nAbstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Despite advances in cardiac arrest resuscitation, neurologic impairments and other organ dysfunctions cause considerable mortality and morbidity after restoration of spontaneous cardiac activity. The mechanisms underlying this postresuscitation disease probably involve a whole-body ischemia and reperfusion syndrome that triggers a systemic inflammatory response.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Postresuscitation disease is characterized by high levels of circulating cytokines and adhesion molecules, the presence of plasma endotoxin, and dysregulated leukocyte production of cytokines: a profile similar to that seen in severe sepsis. Transient myocardial dysfunction can occur after resuscitation, mainly as a result of myocardial stunning. However, early successful angioplasty is independently associated with better outcomes after cardiac arrest associated with myocardial infarction. Coagulation abnormalities occur consistently after successful resuscitation, and their severity is associated with mortality. For example, plasma protein C and S activities after successful resuscitation are lower in nonsurvivors than in survivors. Low baseline cortisol levels may be associated with an increased risk of fatal early refractory shock after cardiac arrest, suggesting adrenal dysfunction in these patients.\nSUMMARY: Postresuscitation abnormalities after cardiac arrest mimic the immunologic and coagulation disorders observed in severe sepsis. This suggests that therapeutic approaches used recently with success in severe sepsis should be investigated in patients successfully resuscitated after cardiac arrest.\n## Response:\n"}

AVP is derived from a larger precursor peptide along with the more stable peptide copeptin. Copeptin is the C-terminal part of provasopressin and has been shown to be a useful tool to indicate AVP concentration in critically ill patients.\nOBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to evaluate the clinical usefulness of copeptin as a new marker in disordered states of blood volume and plasma osmolality.\nDESIGN AND SETTING: This was a prospective observational study in a university hospital.\nPARTICIPANTS AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Three techniques with respective control studies were used in 24 healthy adults to produce changes in plasma osmolality and/or volume: 1) a 28-h water deprivation, 2) a 17-h hypertonic saline infusion combined with thirsting, and 3) a hypotonic saline infusion with iv desmopressin administration during free water intake.\nRESULTS: Water deprivation produced a weight loss of 1.7 kg, an increase in plasma osmolality to 294.8 +/- 4.3 mosmol/kg, and an increase of copeptin from 4.6 +/- 1.7 pmol/liter to 9.2 +/- 5.2 pmol/liter (P < 0.0001). During hypertonic saline infusion and thirsting with a raise of plasma osmolality to 296.1 +/- 3.4 mosmol/kg, copeptin increased from 4.9 +/- 3.0 pmol/liter to 19.9 +/- 4.8 pmol/liter (P < 0.0001). Conversely, during hypotonic saline infusion, plasma osmolality decreased to 271.3 +/- 4.1 mosmol/kg, and copeptin decreased from 6.2 +/- 2.4 pmol/liter to 2.4 +/- 2.1 pmol/liter (P < 0.01).\nCONCLUSION: Copeptin shows identical changes during disordered water states as previously shown for AVP. It might be a reliable marker of AVP secretion and substitute for the measurement of circulating AVP levels in clinical routine.\n## Response:\n"}

Our aim was to assess the effects of plain packaging, warning labels, and a 20\u00a0% tax on predicted SSB preferences, beliefs and purchase probabilities amongst young people.\nMETHODS: A 2\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20092 between-group experimental study was conducted over a one-week period in August 2014. Intervention scenarios were delivered, and outcome data collected, via an anonymous online survey. Participants were 604 New Zealand young people aged 13-24 years who consumed soft drinks regularly. Participants were randomly allocated using a computer-generated algorithm to view one of 12 experimental conditions, specifically images of branded versus plain packaged SSBs, with either no warning, a text warning, or a graphic warning, and with or without a 20\u00a0% tax. Participant perceptions of the allocated SSB product and of those who might consume the product were measured using seven-point Likert scales. Purchase probabilities were measured using 11-point Juster scales.\nRESULTS: Six hundred and four young people completed the survey (51\u00a0% female, mean age 18 (SD 3.4) years). All three intervention scenarios had a significant negative effect on preferences for SSBs (plain packaging: F (6, 587)\u2009=\u200954.4, p <0.001; warning label: F (6, 588)\u2009=\u200919.8, p <0.001; 20\u00a0% tax: F (6, 587)\u2009=\u200911.3, p <0.001). Plain packaging and warning labels also had a significant negative impact on reported likelihood of purchasing SSB's (p\u2009=\u2009<0.001). A 20\u00a0% tax reduced participants' purchase probability but the difference was not statistically significant (p\u2009=\u20090.2).\nCONCLUSIONS: Plain packaging and warning labels significantly reduce young people's predicted preferences for, and reported probability of purchasing, SSBs.\n## Response:\n"}

Ultrasound imaging was used to identify the brachial plexus before the block, guide the block needle to reach target nerves, and visualize the pattern of local anesthetic spread. Needle position was further confirmed by nerve stimulation before injection. The block technique we describe aligned the needle path with the ultrasound beam. The block was successful after one attempt in 95% of the cases, with one failure attributable to subcutaneous injection and one to partial intravascular injection. Pneumothorax did not occur. Our preliminary data suggest that a high-resolution ultrasound probe can reliably identify the brachial plexus and its neighboring structures in the supraclavicular region. The technique of real-time guidance during needle advancement can quickly localize nerves. Distinct patterns of local anesthetic spread observed on ultrasound can further confirm accurate needle location.\nIMPLICATIONS: Real-time ultrasound imaging during supraclavicular brachial plexus blocks can facilitate nerve localization and needle placement and examine the pattern of local anesthetic spread.\n## Response:\n"}

We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of aspirin versus placebo in patients with a moderate estimated risk of a first cardiovascular event.\nMETHODS: ARRIVE is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study done in seven countries. Eligible patients were aged 55 years (men) or 60 years (women) and older and had an average cardiovascular risk, deemed to be moderate on the basis of the number of specific risk factors. We excluded patients at high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding or other bleeding, or diabetes. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) with a computer-generated randomisation code to receive enteric-coated aspirin tablets (100 mg) or placebo tablets, once daily. Patients, investigators, and others involved in treatment or data analysis were masked to treatment allocation. The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite outcome of time to first occurrence of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, or transient ischaemic attack. Safety endpoints were haemorrhagic events and incidence of other adverse events, and were analysed in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00501059.\nFINDINGS: Between July 5, 2007, and Nov 15, 2016, 12\u2008546 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive aspirin (n=6270) or placebo (n=6276) at 501 study sites. Median follow-up was 60 months. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the primary endpoint occurred in 269 (4\u00b729%) patients in the aspirin group versus 281 (4\u00b748%) patients in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b796; 95% CI 0\u00b781-1\u00b713; p=0\u00b76038). Gastrointestinal bleeding events (mostly mild) occurred in 61 (0\u00b797%) patients in the aspirin group versus 29 (0\u00b746%) in the placebo group (HR 2\u00b711; 95% CI 1\u00b736-3\u00b728; p=0\u00b70007). The overall incidence rate of serious adverse events was similar in both treatment groups (n=1266 [20\u00b719%] in the aspirin group vs n=1311 [20\u00b789%] in the placebo group. The overall incidence of adverse events was similar in both treatment groups (n=5142 [82\u00b701%] vs n=5129 [81\u00b772%] in the placebo group). The overall incidence of treatment-related adverse events was low (n=1050 [16\u00b775%] vs n=850 [13\u00b754%] in the placebo group; p<0\u00b70001). There were 321 documented deaths in the intention-to-treat population (n=160 [2\u00b755%] vs n=161 [2\u00b757%] of 6276 patients in the placebo group).\nINTERPRETATION: The event rate was much lower than expected, which is probably reflective of contemporary risk management strategies, making the study more representative of a low-risk population. The role of aspirin in primary prevention among patients at moderate risk could therefore not be addressed. Nonetheless, the findings with respect to aspirin's effects are consistent with those observed in the previously published low-risk primary prevention studies.\nFUNDING: Bayer.\n## Response:\n"}

Patients with Stage IV PAOD were equally randomised to either 4 weeks of alprostadil treatment twice daily or to placebo treatment twice daily. The primary efficacy variables were the rate of complete healing of all necrosis and ulceration 12 weeks after the end of treatment and the frequency of major amputations 24 weeks after the end of treatment.\nRESULTS: A total of 840 patients were randomised between 2004 and 2013. At baseline, no major differences between treatment groups were found. The rate of \"complete healing\" was 18.4% in patients on alprostadil and 17.2% in patients on placebo. The rates of \"major amputations\" were 12.6% in patients on alprostadil and 14.6% in patients on placebo. The adjusted difference between alprostadil and placebo including their 95% confidence intervals was 1.1 (-4.0 to 6.3) for \"complete healing\" and\u00a0-2.1 (-6.7 to 2.5) for \"major amputations.\" In the subgroup of diabetic patients the rates of major amputations were numerically lower in the alprostadil than placebo group (10.6% vs. 17.4%). Within the total cohort a non-significant difference in \"decrease in ulcer area \u226550%\" was reached in 30.2% of patients on alprostadil and in 24.3% of patients on placebo at end of treatment.\nCONCLUSIONS: In this study, superiority of alprostadil over placebo could not be shown. Nevertheless, a slight numerical but not clinically relevant advantage for alprostadil emerged from the \"area decrease of ulcers by\u00a0\u2265\u00a050%,\" indicating that a healing effect may have started.

Pharmacologic treatments include both topical and oral medications, which are increasingly being used in combination, especially at the outset of therapy. This exploratory study assesses the safety, effectiveness and speed of onset of two common topical agents for the treatment of rosacea--azelaic acid gel (AzA) 15% and metronidazole gel 1%--used in conjunction with anti-inflammatory dose doxycycline (40 mg once daily). Men and women (n = 207) with mild-to-moderate papulopustular rosacea were enrolled and randomized to receive either AzA gel 15% twice daily plus doxycycline 40 mg once daily (AzA group) or metronidazole gel 1% once daily plus doxycycline 40 mg once daily (Metro group) for 12 weeks. Both regimens were safe, efficacious and well tolerated. Efficacy parameters revealed a possible trend toward greater and earlier benefit with the AzA-based regimen than with the metronidazole-based regimen. These findings warrant further investigation in a sufficiently powered study.\n## Response:\n"}

Since resveratrol could be administered both in the diet and as a therapeutic agent, defining appropriate concentrations requires understanding of the pharmacokinetics. Resveratrol absorption is rapid but plasma concentrations are low as it is rapidly and efficiently converted into relatively hydrophilic phase-2 conjugates, and metabolites, which are then rapidly excreted via the urine and bile. Resveratrol is an effective antioxidant in vivo by increasing NO synthesis and also maintaining the reduced intracellular redox state via the thioredoxin system. Further, activation of sirtuins (one class of lysine deacetylases) may mediate the cardiovascular responses shown by resveratrol. Studies on animal models of human disease suggest that resveratrol has the potential to decrease cardiovascular symptoms in patients with myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, hypertension, cardiomyopathies, fibrosis, atherosclerosis, thrombosis and diabetes, but, as yet, human clinical trials are rare. Cardioprotection by resveratrol in rodent models may rely on mechanisms producing pharmacological preconditioning in the heart including reducing reactive oxygen species, improving vasorelaxation and angiogenesis, preventing inflammation and apoptosis, delaying atherosclerosis as well as decreasing cardiovascular remodelling. Interventional studies in humans need to be completed before resveratrol can be considered as a standard therapeutic agent. Therefore, future studies should focus on obtaining the level of evidence required to determine whether resveratrol can be added to the list of evidence-based therapies for cardiovascular diseases that includes renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and calcium entry blockers.\n## Response:\n"}

After previously receiving commercially available lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (30, 50, or 70 mg/d) for \u2265 6 months with acceptable tolerability and maintaining response during a 3-week open-label phase at a stable lisdexamfetamine dimesylate dose, the participants entered a 6-week double-blind randomized withdrawal phase on treatment with lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (same dose) or placebo. Data were collected from April 2009 to July 2010. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants having symptom relapse (\u2265 50% increase in ADHD-RS-IV score and \u2265 2 rating-point increase in CGI-S score).\nRESULTS: A total of 116 participants were randomized (lisdexamfetamine dimesylate n = 56; placebo n = 60). At the randomized withdrawal phase baseline, mean (SD) ADHD-RS-IV scores for lisdexamfetamine dimesylate and placebo were 10.6 (4.96) and 10.6 (4.82), respectively. At endpoint, 8.9% (5/56) of adults taking lisdexamfetamine dimesylate and 75.0% (45/60) taking placebo (P < .0001) showed symptom relapse; most showed relapse after 1 and 2 weeks of the randomized withdrawal phase (4 and 0 adults taking lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, 26 and 10 taking placebo, respectively). During the randomized withdrawal phase, treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 48.2% and 30.0% of participants in the lisdexamfetamine dimesylate and placebo groups, respectively. Treatment-emergent adverse events with incidence \u2265 5% in the lisdexamfetamine dimesylate and placebo groups were headache (14.3% and 5.0%), insomnia (5.4% and 5.0%), and upper respiratory tract infection (8.9% and 0%).\nCONCLUSIONS: In adults with ADHD on medium- to long-term treatment, lisdexamfetamine dimesylate demonstrated maintenance of efficacy vs placebo upon randomized withdrawal. A majority of patients given placebo showed symptom relapse by 2 weeks. The safety profile of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate was generally consistent with previous lisdexamfetamine dimesylate studies.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00877487.\n## Response:\n"}

These regions included the left rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), bilateral superior frontal gyrus (SFG), and right medial frontopolar cortex (MFPC). Together with the LA, these six prefrontal regions thus formed the functional neuroanatomical network engaged during the rtfMRI-nf procedure. Here we perform a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) analysis of the effective connectivity for this network. The SVAR analysis demonstrates that the left rACC plays an important role during the rtfMRI-nf training, modulating the LA and the other network regions. According to the analysis, the rtfMRI-nf training leads to a significant enhancement in the time-lagged effect of the left rACC on the LA, potentially consistent with the ipsilateral distribution of the monosynaptic projections between these regions. The training is also accompanied by significant increases in the instantaneous (contemporaneous) effects of the left rACC on four other regions - the bilateral DMPFC, the right MFPC, and the left SFG. The instantaneous effects of the LA on the bilateral DMPFC are also significantly enhanced. Our results are consistent with a broad literature supporting the role of the rACC in emotion processing and regulation. Our exploratory analysis provides, for the first time, insights into the causal relationships within the network of regions engaged during the rtfMRI-nf procedure targeting the amygdala. It suggests that the rACC may constitute a promising target for rtfMRI-nf training along with the amygdala in patients with affective disorders, particularly posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n## Response:\n"}

The development of novel therapeutic agents to reduce NIHL will potentially benefit multiple very large noise-exposed populations. Oxidative stress has been identified as a significant contributor to noise-induced sensory cell death and NIHL, and several antioxidant strategies have now been suggested for potential translation to human subjects. One such strategy is a combination of beta-carotene, vitamins C and E, and magnesium, which has shown promise for protection against NIHL in rodent models, and is being evaluated in a series of international human clinical trials using temporary (military gunfire, audio player use) and permanent (stamping factory, military airbase) threshold shift models (NCT00808470). The noise exposures used in the recently completed Swedish military gunfire study described in this report did not, on average, result in measurable changes in auditory function using conventional pure-tone thresholds and distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) amplitudes as metrics. However, analysis of the plasma samples confirmed significant elevations in the bloodstream 2 hours after oral consumption of active clinical supplies, indicating the dose is realistic. The plasma outcomes are encouraging, but clinical acceptance of any novel therapeutic critically depends on demonstration that the agent reduces noise-induced threshold shift in randomized, placebo-controlled, prospective human clinical trials. Although this noise insult did not induce hearing loss, the trial design and study protocol can be applied to other populations exposed to different noise insults.\n## Response:\n"}

Given organ shortage it should be essential to determine which patients will experience progressive and severe renal dysfunction after liver transplantation (LT).\nAIM: To correlate pre-transplant renal function and risk factors for renal failure after liver transplantation with occurrence of renal failure at 1 and 5 years after LT, with particular attention to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.\nMETHODS: Data from patients enrolled in the liver section of Neoral MOST (Multinational Observational Study in Transplantation) study were used for the analysis. HCV status, pre-transplant serum creatinine level, recipient gender, recipient age, pre-transplant arterial hypertension, pre-transplant diabetes mellitus, pre-transplant antiviral therapy, the time of the transplant (before or after 2000) and immunosuppressive regimen were collected for each patient. Post-transplant occurrence of renal failure at 1 and 5 years was defined as a GFR<60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (Stage III of the National Kidney Foundation).\nRESULTS: Data from 1948 patients enrolled in the study were considered. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was evaluated in 406 patients at 1 year and in 233 patients at 5 years after LT. The prevalence of HCV infection was 35% in the former and 37% in the latter. The median GFR was 70 mL/min/1.73 m(2) after 1 year and 69 mL/min after 5 years, significantly lower in HCV-positive (HCV+) than in HCV-negative (HCV-) patients both 1 and 5 years after LT (p<0.001). GFR before transplant correlated with GFR at 1 month, 1 and 3 years (p<0.0001 for all correlations). Multivariate analysis confirmed HCV status, pre-LT serum creatinine levels and recipient gender as significant predictors of 1-year GFR (p<0.001 for all three). Further analysis of the effect of recipient gender indicated that the only significant risk factor observed in both male and female patients was HCV positivity. Only 1-year GFR was an independent predictor of 5-year GFR (p<0.001). HCV+ status, cyclosporine (CsA) exposure, antiviral therapy and diabetes mellitus had no significant influence on 5-year GFR.\nCONCLUSIONS: HCV status and pre-LT serum creatinine levels were independent predictors of renal function a year after LT, together with GFR before transplant. The negative impact of HCV positivity on renal function was not confirmed in the long term, whereas the prognostic influence of an abnormal renal function in the early post-transplant period was more persistent.\n## Response:\n"}

Baseline and 12 weeks\nAbstract: CONTEXT: The dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, linagliptin, possesses pleiotropic vasodilatory, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties in animals, independent of its glucose-lowering properties. Although large, randomized clinical trials are being conducted to better evaluate the efficacy and safety of linagliptin on cardiovascular outcomes, little is known about its effects on vascular function in humans.\nOBJECTIVE: This study sought to evaluate the effect of linagliptin on surrogates of vascular and mitochondrial function.\nDESIGN AND SETTING: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at a tertiary care center with a large type 2 diabetes referral base.\nPATIENTS AND INTERVENTION: Forty participants with type 2 diabetes were included in a 12-wk treatment of either linagliptin 5mg/d or placebo.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Micro- and macrovascular functions were assessed using laser Doppler coupled with iontophoresis and with brachial flow-mediated dilation, respectively. Mitochondrial function was assessed by phosphorus-31 metabolites changes in the calf muscle measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Circulating endothelial progenitor cells, as well as inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and biomarkers of endothelial function were also quantified.\nRESULTS: Linagliptin was associated with an increase in axon reflex-dependent vasodilation, a marker of neurovascular function (P = .05). A trend indicating increased endothelium-dependent microvascular reactivity was observed (P = .07). These were associated with decreases in concentrations of IFN\u03b3 (P < .05), IL-6 (P = .03), IL-12 (P < .03), and MIP-1 (P < .04) following linagliptin treatment when compared with placebo.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that linagliptin tends to improve endothelial and neurovascular microvascular function and is associated with decreased markers of inflammation in patients with type 2 diabetes. There was no significant effect of linagliptin on mitochondrial function, macrovascular function, or endothelial progenitor cells.\n## Response:\n"}

Smartphone applications (apps) for patient support exist but their potential to improve adherence has not been systematically evaluated.\nOBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether a study-specific app improves adherence and reduces psoriasis symptoms compared with standard treatment.\nMETHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT, clinicaltrials.gov registration: NCT02858713). Patients received once-daily medication [calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate (Cal/BD) cutaneous foam] and were randomized to no app (n\u00a0=\u00a066) or app intervention (n\u00a0=\u00a068) groups. In total, 122 patients (91%) completed the 22-week follow-up. The primary outcome was adherence, which was defined as medication applied \u2265\u00a080% of days during the treatment period and assessed by a chip integrated into the medication dispenser. Secondary outcomes were psoriasis severity measured by the Lattice System Physician's Global Assessment (LS-PGA) and quality of life, measured using the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) at all visits.\nRESULTS: Intention-to-treat analyses using regression was performed. More patients in the intervention group were adherent to Cal/BD cutaneous foam than those in the nonintervention group at week 4 (65% vs. 38%, P\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b7004). The intervention group showed a greater LS-PGA reduction than the nonintervention group at week 4 (mean 1\u00b786 vs. 1\u00b746, P\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b7047). A similar effect was seen at weeks 8 and 26, although it did not reach statistical significance.\nCONCLUSIONS: This RCT demonstrates that the app improved short-term adherence to Cal/BD cutaneous foam treatment and psoriasis severity.\n## Response:\n"}

We aimed to assess the ability of United States (US) obstetricians to use this system appropriately for intrapartum care.\nSTUDY DESIGN: A prospective nonrandomized trial was conducted in 6 sites. Enrollment required a singleton vertex fetus, >36 weeks' gestation, with indications for direct fetal monitoring during first stage of labor. Appropriate use was measured by negative predictive value (NPV) of nonintervention for fetuses with nonreassuring fetal heart rate (FHR) patterns, normal STAN readings, and normal neonatal outcomes with umbilical cord arterial pH >7.12; and percent agreement (PA) for intervention decisions with 3 STAN experts who conducted retrospective case reviews blinded to outcome.\nRESULTS: Five hundred and thirty patients were enrolled. An NPV of 95.2% was achieved while PA between investigators and STAN experts was 84%, and 90%, for intervention and nonintervention, respectively. No fetus with metabolic acidosis requiring intervention was missed by US clinicians.\nCONCLUSION: US clinicians used the STAN system appropriately in a manner similar to that of experienced STAN users.\n## Response:\n"}

The aim of our study was to improve the understanding of gene expression profile of cumulus cells (CC) in terms of ovarian stimulation protocol and oocyte maturity. We applied Affymetrix gene expression profiling in CC of oocytes at different maturation stages using either GnRH agonists or GnRH antagonists. Two analyses were performed: the first involved CC of immature metaphase I (MI) and mature metaphase II (MII) oocytes where 359 genes were differentially expressed, and the second involved the two GnRH analogues where no differentially expressed genes were observed at the entire transcriptome level. A further analysis of 359 differentially genes was performed, focusing on anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone receptor 2 (AMHR2), follicle stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGFC) and serine protease inhibitor E2 (SERPINE2). Among other differentially expressed genes we observed a marked number of new genes connected to cell adhesion and neurotransmitters such as dopamine, glycine and \u03b3-Aminobutyric acid (GABA). No differential expression in CC between the two GnRH analogues supports the findings of clinical studies where no significant difference in live birth rates between both GnRH analogues has been proven.\n## Response:\n"}

They do not indicate why a client may be motivated to change, or provide guidance on how to retain an unmotivated client in treatment. The authors interviewed 415 substance abuse clients about their reasons for entering treatment and scored their responses along the dimensions of (a) negative versus positive treatment-entry pressures, (b) internal versus external sources of those pressures, and (c) the life domain from which the pressures emanated. Exploratory cluster analysis yielded 5 types of clients characterized by different profiles of perceived treatment-entry pressures. Cluster membership was predictive of treatment outcomes, and the clusters differed by demographic variables. These data support the discriminative and predictive utility of performing a multidimensional assessment of pressures to enter treatment.\n## Response:\n"}

Up to 7 years after study opens\nAbstract: PURPOSE: Circulating tumor cell (CTC) enumeration has not been prospectively validated in standard first-line docetaxel treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. We assessed the prognostic value of CTCs for overall survival (OS) and disease response in S0421, a phase III trial of docetaxel plus prednisone with or without atrasentan.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: CTCs were enumerated at baseline (day 0) and before cycle two (day 21) using CellSearch. Baseline counts and changes in counts from day 0 to 21 were evaluated for association with OS, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and RECIST response using Cox regression as well as receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves, integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) analysis, and regression trees.\nRESULTS: Median day-0 CTC count was five cells per 7.5 mL, and CTCs < versus \u2265 five per 7.5 mL were significantly associated with baseline PSA, bone pain, liver disease, hemoglobin, alkaline phosphatase, and subsequent PSA and RECIST response. Median OS was 26 months for < five versus 13 months for \u2265 five CTCs per 7.5 mL at day 0 (hazard ratio [HR], 2.74 [adjusting for covariates]). ROC curves had higher areas under the curve for day-0 CTCs than for PSA, and IDI analysis showed that adding day-0 CTCs to baseline PSA and other covariates increased predictive accuracy for survival by 8% to 10%. Regression trees yielded new prognostic subgroups, and rising CTC count from day 0 to 21 was associated with shorter OS (HR, 2.55).\nCONCLUSION: These data validate the prognostic utility of CTC enumeration in a large docetaxel-based prospective cohort. Baseline CTC counts were prognostic, and rising CTCs at 3 weeks heralded significantly worse OS, potentially serving as an early metric to help redirect and optimize therapy in this clinical setting.\n## Response:\n"}

Despite advances in anesthetic and surgical techniques, post-tonsillectomy morbidity remains a significant clinical problem.\nOBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical efficacy of a single intra-operative dose of dexamethasone in reducing post-tonsillectomy morbidity.\nSEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 1, 2002), MEDLINE (from 1966 - February 2002), EMBASE (from 1974 - February 2002) and reference lists of relevant articles. We contacted leading experts for information on any relevant unpublished data.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of a single dose of intravenous, intra-operative corticosteroid for pediatric patients (age < 18 years) who underwent tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy were included.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data regarding the primary outcome measures and measurement tools were extracted by the first author from the published studies. Data regarding study design, patient ages, procedures performed, dose of corticosteroid and method of delivery, as well as methodologic quality were also recorded by the first author. When data were missing from the original publications, the authors were contacted for more information. Data analysis was performed with a random effects model, using the RevMan 4.1 software developed by the Cochrane Collaboration.\nMAIN RESULTS: Children receiving a single intra-operative dose of dexamethasone (dose range = 0.15 to 1.0 mg/kg; maximum dose range = 8 to 25 mg) were two times less likely to vomit in the first 24 hours than children receiving placebo (RR = 0.54, CI95 = 0.42, 0.69; p < 0.00001). Routine use in four children would be expected to result in one less patient experiencing post-tonsillectomy emesis (RD = -0.25, CI95 = -0.37, -0.13; p = 0.00004). Additionally, children receiving dexamethasone were more likely to advance to a soft/solid diet on post-tonsillectomy day 1 (RR = 1.69, CI95 = 1.02, 2.79; p = 0.04) than those receiving placebo. Due to missing data and varied outcome measurement tools, pain could not be meaningfully analyzed as a distinct outcome measure.\nREVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: The evidence suggests that a single intravenous dose of dexamethasone is an effective, relatively safe and inexpensive treatment for reducing morbidity from pediatric tonsillectomy. No adverse events attributable to dexamethasone were reported in these trials. Additionally, in our 10-year experience of routine use of a single intravenous dose of dexamethasone during pediatric tonsillectomy, there have been no attributable, adverse events. Lastly, we found no reports in the literature of complications from use of a single intravenous dose of corticosteroid during pediatric tonsillectomy.\n## Response:\n"}

In this study we describe the use of these agents in 101 consecutive patients undergoing renal transplantation using only a 7-day course of prednisolone. Median follow-up was 33 months (range 18-44). Patient and graft survival at 1 year were 100% and 98%, respectively. The acute rejection rate at both 6 and 12 months was 19%, with two episodes beyond 12 months. Anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody (anti-CD25 mAb) was administered to 25 patients at high immunological risk: a trend toward a lower rejection rate was seen in these patients compared with those at lower risk but not receiving induction therapy (8% vs. 22%; p = 0.11). Two patients experienced recurrent rejection. Of the twenty-three rejection episodes in total, 26% showed vascular involvement. Allograft function was preserved at 12 months with a mean creatinine of 144 micromol/L and mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 55 mL/min. At 12 months, the incidence of post-transplant diabetes mellitus was 3.5%. This steroid-sparing regime is associated with excellent patient and graft outcomes, and a low incidence of side effects.\n## Response:\n"}

This study compares the efficacy and safety of insulin lispro protamine suspension (ILPS) and insulin glargine in insulin-naive patients with T2D and inadequate control on oral antihyperglycaemic medication (OAM).\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: An open-label, randomized, multicentre, multinational 24-week study of 471 patients receiving \u22652 OAMs for \u22653 months with a body mass index between 25 and 45 kg/m(2) and HbA1c 7.5-10.0% was conducted. ILPS was injected once or twice daily vs. glargine injected once daily plus prestudy OAMs. Primary objective compared the HbA1c change from baseline.\nRESULTS: HbA1c change from baseline to endpoint was similar in both groups [-1.46% (ILPS) and -1.41% (glargine)]. Least-squares mean difference (95% CI) for HbA1c (-0.05 [-0.21, 0.11]%), glycaemic variability (0.06 [-0.06, 0.19] mmol/l) and weight change (-0.01 [-0.61, 0.59] kg) showed non-inferiority (margins of 0.4%, 0.8 mmol/l and 1.5 kg, respectively). Percentages of patients achieving HbA1c <7.0% were 43.8% ILPS and 41.2% glargine. Mean daily insulin dose was 0.39 vs. 0.35 U/kg (p = 0.02) and weight gain was 1.04 vs. 1.07 kg for ILPS vs. glargine (p = 0.98). Overall hypoglycaemia (episodes/patient/year) was similar for ILPS and glargine (24.2 \u00b1 28.8 vs. 23.0 \u00b1 30.9); nocturnal (6.1 \u00b1 10.6 vs. 4.1 \u00b1 9.4, p < 0.001) rates were higher for ILPS. Severe hypoglycaemia was higher for ILPS vs. glargine (n = 9 vs. n = 2; p = 0.04).\nCONCLUSIONS: At endpoint, ILPS was non-inferior to glargine in HbA1c change from baseline, but associated with increased risk of hypoglycaemia.\n## Response:\n"}

The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of amiodarone for prevention of atrial fibrillation after transthoracic esophagectomy.\nMETHODS: Eighty patients undergoing transthoracic esophagectomy were randomly, prospectively assigned to receive amiodarone (n = 40) or no prophylaxis (control group, n = 40). Amiodarone-treated patients received the drug by continuous infusion, initiated at the time of induction of anesthesia, at a rate of 0.73 mg/min (43.75 mg/h), and continued for 96 hours (total dose 4200 mg). The primary end point was atrial fibrillation requiring treatment. Secondary end points included any atrial fibrillation lasting longer than 30 seconds and postoperative hospital and intensive care unit stays.\nRESULTS: There were no significant differences between the amiodarone and control groups in demographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, or preoperative or postoperative use of beta-blockers or calcium-channel blockers. The incidence of atrial fibrillation requiring treatment was lower in the amiodarone group than in the control group (15% vs 40%, P = .02, relative risk reduction 62.5%). There were no significant differences between the amiodarone and control groups in median hospital stay (11 days vs 12 days, P = .31) or median intensive care unit stay (68 hours vs 77 hours, p = .097). There were no significant difference between the groups in the incidences of adverse effects.\nCONCLUSIONS: Amiodarone prophylaxis significantly reduced the incidence of atrial fibrillation after transthoracic esophagectomy.\n## Response:\n"}

Patients were randomized 2\u2009:\u20091 to receive lixisenatide 20\u2009\u00b5g once daily or placebo. The primary endpoint was change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) at week 24.\nRESULTS: In total, 484 patients were randomized: 323 to lixisenatide; 161 to placebo. After 24\u2009weeks, lixisenatide once daily significantly improved HbA1c (-0.56% vs. placebo; p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and increased the proportion of patients achieving HbA1c <7% compared with placebo (52.3% vs. 26.4%, respectively; p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and significantly improved fasting plasma glucose (-0.84\u2009mmol/l vs. placebo; p\u2009<\u20090.0001). There was a small decrease in body weight with lixisenatide once daily and a small increase with placebo, with no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Overall, lixisenatide once daily was well tolerated, with a similar proportion of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious TEAEs between groups (lixisenatide: 72.4% and 2.5%; placebo: 72.7% and 1.9%).

This study evaluated the efficacy of Many Men, Many Voices (3MV), a small-group HIV/STI prevention intervention developed by Black MSM-serving community-based organizations and a university-based HIV/STI prevention and training program. The study sample included 338 Black MSM of HIV-negative or unknown HIV serostatus residing in New York city. Participants were randomly assigned to the 3MV intervention condition (n = 164) or wait-list comparison condition (n = 174). Relative to comparison participants, 3MV participants reported significantly greater reductions in any unprotected anal intercourse with casual male partners; a trend for consistent condom use during receptive anal intercourse with casual male partners; and significantly greater reductions in the number of male sex partners and greater increases in HIV testing. This study is the first randomized trial to demonstrate the efficacy of an HIV/STI prevention intervention for Black MSM.\n## Response:\n"}

Simultaneous HIV-, HBV-, and HCV-rapid tests could help improve infection awareness and linkage-to-care in particularly vulnerable populations. Methods. \u2003The OptiScreen III study was a single-center, randomized, control trial conducted at a free clinic (\"M\u00e9decins du Monde\", Paris, France). Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive 1 of 2 interventions testing for HIV, HBV, and HCV: standard serology-based testing (S-arm) or point-of-care rapid testing (RT-arm). The main study endpoints were the proportion of participants who became aware of their HIV, HBV, and HCV status and who were linked to care when testing positive. Results. \u2003A total of 324 individuals, representing mainly African immigrants, were included. In the S-arm, 115 of 162 (71.0%) participants performed a blood draw and 104 of 162 (64.2%) retrieved their test result. In comparison, 159 of 162 (98.2%) of participants randomized to the RT-arm obtained their results (P < .001). Of the 38 (11.7%) participants testing positive (HIV, n = 7; HBV, n = 23; HCV, n = 8), 15 of 18 (83.3%) in the S-arm and 18 of 20 (90.0%) in the RT-arm were linked-to-care (P = .7). In post hoc analysis assuming the same disease prevalence in those without obtaining test results, difference in linkage-to-care was more pronounced (S-arm = 60.0% vs RT-arm = 90.0%; P = .04). Conclusions. \u2003In a highly at-risk population for chronic viral infections, the simultaneous use of HIV, HBV, and HCV point-of-care tests clearly improves the \"cascade of screening\" and quite possibly linkage-to-care.\n## Response:\n"}

Primary outcomes were COPD-related quality of life and the dyspnea subscale of the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes were self-efficacy for managing COPD, exercise capacity (6-min walk test), and number of COPD exacerbations. Additional outcomes were COPD symptoms, lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 s percent predicted), smoking status, bed days owing to COPD, quality of care (Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care), COPD knowledge, and symptoms of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire). Outpatient visits, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations were assessed by review of medical records. Generalized linear modeling was used to adjust for baseline values and account for clustering by clinic.\nRESULTS: Of 192 patients enrolled, 158 (82%) completed 9 months of follow-up. There were no significant differences between study arms for the primary or secondary outcomes. At 9 months, patients in the coached group reported better quality of care (mean Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care score, 3.30 vs. 3.18; adjusted P\u2009=\u20090.02) and were less likely to report symptoms of moderate to severe depression (Patient Health Questionnaire score, \u226515) than those in the usual care arm (6% vs. 20%; adjusted P\u2009=\u20090.01). During the study, patients in the coaching arm had 48% fewer hospitalizations related to COPD (0.27/patient/yr vs. 0.52/patient/yr), but this difference was not significant in the adjusted analysis.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results help inform expectations regarding the limitations and benefits of health coaching for patients with COPD. They may be useful to health policy experts in assessing the potential value of reimbursement and incentives for health coaching-type activities for patients with chronic disease.

In a nonrandomized, retrospective study, intravenous (IV) calcium/magnesium (Ca/Mg) was associated with reduced oxaliplatin-induced sNT.\nMETHODS: Patients with colon cancer undergoing adjuvant therapy with infusional fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) were randomly assigned to Ca/Mg (1g calcium gluconate plus 1g magnesium sulfate pre- and post-oxaliplatin) or placebo, in a double-blinded manner. The primary end point was the percentage of patients with grade 2 or greater sNT at any time during or after oxaliplatin-based therapy by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE; version 3) criteria. An oxaliplatin-specific sNT scale and patient questionnaires were also used to assess sNT. After 104 of 300 planned patients were enrolled, the study was closed. This was due to preliminary reports from another trial that suggested that Ca/Mg decreased treatment efficacy; these data were subsequently found to be incorrect.\nRESULTS: Overall, 102 patients were available for analysis. Ca/Mg decreased the incidence of chronic, cumulative, grade 2 or greater sNT, as measured by NCI CTCAE (P = .038) and also by the oxaliplatin-specific sNT scale (P = .018). In addition, acute muscle spasms associated with oxaliplatin were significantly reduced (P = .01) No effect on acute, cold-induced sNT was found. No substantial differences in adverse effects were noted between Ca/Mg and placebo.\nCONCLUSION: Despite early termination and decreased statistical power, this study supports IV Ca/Mg as an effective neuroprotectant against oxaliplatin-induced cumulative sNT in adjuvant colon cancer.\n## Response:\n"}

Preclinical studies with exenatide have suggested sustained improvements in beta-cell function. We investigated the effects of 52 weeks of treatment with exenatide or insulin glargine followed by an off-drug period on hyperglycemic clamp-derived measures of beta-cell function, glycemic control, and body weight.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Sixty-nine metformin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to exenatide (n = 36) or insulin glargine (n = 33). beta-Cell function was measured during an arginine-stimulated hyperglycemic clamp at week 0, at week 52, and after a 4-week off-drug period. Additional end points included effects on glycemic control, body weight, and safety.\nRESULTS: Treatment-induced change in combined glucose- and arginine-stimulated C-peptide secretion was 2.46-fold (95% CI 2.09-2.90, P < 0.0001) greater after a 52-week exenatide treatment compared with insulin glargine treatment. Both exenatide and insulin glargine reduced A1C similarly: -0.8 +/- 0.1 and -0.7 +/- 0.2%, respectively (P = 0.55). Exenatide reduced body weight compared with insulin glargine (difference -4.6 kg, P < 0.0001). beta-Cell function measures returned to pretreatment values in both groups after a 4-week off-drug period. A1C and body weight rose to pretreatment values 12 weeks after discontinuation of either exenatide or insulin glargine therapy.\nCONCLUSIONS: Exenatide significantly improves beta-cell function during 1 year of treatment compared with titrated insulin glargine. After cessation of both exenatide and insulin glargine therapy, beta-cell function and glycemic control returned to pretreatment values, suggesting that ongoing treatment is necessary to maintain the beneficial effects of either therapy.\n## Response:\n"}

Because insulin's vasodilator effect is nitric oxide dependent, this impairment may reflect endothelial dysfunction. Troglitazone, an insulin-sensitiser, might thus improve insulin-dependent and/or endothelium-dependent vascular function in insulin resistant obese subjects. For 8 weeks, fifteen obese subjects were treated with either 400 mg troglitazone once daily or placebo, in a randomised, double-blind, cross-over design. At the end of each treatment period, we measured forearm vasodilator responses (plethysmography) to intra-arterial administered acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside; insulin sensitivity and insulin-induced vascular and neurohumoral responses (clamp); vasoconstrictor responses to NC-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) during hyperinsulinaemia; and ambulatory 24-h blood pressure (ABPM). Baseline data (placebo) of obese subjects were compared with those obtained in lean control subjects. Obese subjects were insulin resistant compared with leans (whole-body glucose uptake: 26.8+/-3.0 vs. 53.9+/-4.3 [tmol kgl min-, p < 0.001). Troglitazone improved whole-body glucose uptake (to 31.9+/-3.3 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1) , p=0.028), and forearm glucose uptake (from 1.09+/-0.54 to 2.31+/-0.69 micromol dL(-1) x min(-1), p=0.006). Insulin-induced vasodilatation was blunted in obese subjects (percent increase in forearm blood flow (FBF) in lean 66.5+/-23.0%, vs. 10.1+/-11.3% in obese, p=0.04), but did not improve during troglitazone. Vascular responses to acetylcholine, sodium nitroprusside and L-NMMA did not differ between the obese and lean group, nor between both treatment periods in the obese individuals. In conclusion, in insulin resistant obese subjects, endothelial vascular function is normal despite impaired vasodilator responses to insulin. Troglitazone improved insulin sensitivity but it had no effects on endothelium-dependent and -independent vascular responses. These data do not support an association between insulin resistance and endothelial function.\n## Response:\n"}

The purpose of this study was to compare a new mobile compression device with low-molecular-weight heparin with regard to their safety and effectiveness for the prevention of venous thromboembolic disease.\nMETHODS: Patients who had a total hip arthroplasty were randomized to receive prophylaxis with a mobile compression device or low-molecular-weight heparin for ten days. Use of the compression device began intraoperatively, and the patients in this group could receive 81 mg of aspirin daily after the surgery. The first injection of the low-molecular-weight heparin began between twelve and twenty-four hours after the surgery. After ten to twelve days, all patients underwent bilateral lower-extremity duplex ultrasonography to screen for deep venous thrombi in the calf and thigh. Any clinical symptoms of pulmonary embolism were evaluated with spiral computed tomography lung scans. Bleeding events and utilization of (i.e., compliance with) prophylactic treatment in both groups were documented. Clinical evaluation to look for evidence of deep venous thrombi and pulmonary emboli was performed at twelve weeks postoperatively.\nRESULTS: Four hundred and ten patients (414 hips) were randomized; 392 of these patients (395 of the hips) were evaluable with regard to the safety of the intervention and 386 patients (389 hips) were evaluable with regard to its efficacy. Demographics were similar clinically between the groups. The rate of major bleeding events was 0% in the compression group and 6% in the low-molecular-weight heparin group. The rates of distal and proximal deep venous thrombosis were 3% and 2%, respectively, in the compression group compared with 3% and 1% in the heparin group. The rates of pulmonary embolism were 1% in the compression group and 1% in the heparin group, and there were no fatal pulmonary emboli. Within the twelve-week follow-up period, two events (one deep venous thrombosis and one pulmonary embolus) occurred in one patient in the compression group following negative findings on duplex ultrasonography on the twelfth postoperative day. There was no difference between the groups with regard to the prevalence of venous thromboembolism.\nCONCLUSIONS: When compared with low-molecular-weight heparin, use of the mobile compression device for prophylaxis against venous thromboembolic events following total hip arthroplasty resulted in a significant decrease in major bleeding events.\n## Response:\n"}

A cross-sectional study was performed among adult HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. Demographics, comorbidities, and medication lists were collected from medical records. Medication lists were entered into Lexi-Interact drug interaction software and XDDI before/after the addition of SIM- and SOF-containing therapy was documented. Classification and regression tree (CART) analyses identified breakpoints in continuous variables. Before the addition of any HCV therapy, XDDIs were present in 20% of the 335 included patients. After the addition of SIM-containing therapy, the frequency of XDDIs significantly increased to 88.4% (p<0.001). After adding SOF-containing therapy, the prevalence of XDDIs increased to 24.5% (p<0.001). The prevalence of XDDIs was significantly lower for SOF-containing HCV therapy within various types of ART regimens. Use of \u22657 non-HIV medications (CART breakpoint) was the only variable to predict XDDIs before the addition of any HCV therapy. Similarly, this was the only variable to predict XDDIs after the addition of SOF-containing therapy (PR: 4.80; 95% CI: 2.57-8.96, p<0.001).

Infants were randomly assigned to receive placebo or one of four propranolol regimens (1 or 3 mg of propranolol base per kilogram of body weight per day for 3 or 6 months). A preplanned interim analysis was conducted to identify the regimen to study for the final efficacy analysis. The primary end point was success (complete or nearly complete resolution of the target hemangioma) or failure of trial treatment at week 24, as assessed by independent, centralized, blinded evaluations of standardized photographs.\nRESULTS: Of 460 infants who underwent randomization, 456 received treatment. On the basis of an interim analysis of the first 188 patients who completed 24 weeks of trial treatment, the regimen of 3 mg of propranolol per kilogram per day for 6 months was selected for the final efficacy analysis. The frequency of successful treatment was higher with this regimen than with placebo (60% vs. 4%, P<0.001). A total of 88% of patients who received the selected propranolol regimen showed improvement by week 5, versus 5% of patients who received placebo. A total of 10% of patients in whom treatment with propranolol was successful required systemic retreatment during follow-up. Known adverse events associated with propranolol (hypoglycemia, hypotension, bradycardia, and bronchospasm) occurred infrequently, with no significant difference in frequency between the placebo group and the groups receiving propranolol.\nCONCLUSIONS: This trial showed that propranolol was effective at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram per day for 6 months in the treatment of infantile hemangioma.

Recently, some components of the insulin resistance syndrome (IRS) have been related to inflammatory markers. We hypothesized that insulin insensitivity, as directly measured, may be associated with inflammation in nondiabetic subjects.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We studied the relation of C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, and white cell count to components of IRS in the nondiabetic population of the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS) (n=1008; age, 40 to 69 years; 33% with impaired glucose tolerance), a multicenter, population-based study. None of the subjects had clinical coronary artery disease. Insulin sensitivity (S(I)) was measured by a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test, and CRP was measured by a highly sensitive competitive immunoassay. All 3 inflammatory markers were correlated with several components of the IRS. Strong associations were found between CRP and measures of body fat (body mass index, waist circumference), S(I), and fasting insulin and proinsulin (all correlation coefficients >0.3, P<0.0001). The associations were consistent among the 3 ethnic groups of the IRAS. There was a linear increase in CRP levels with an increase in the number of metabolic disorders. Body mass index, systolic blood pressure, and S(I) were related to CRP levels in a multivariate linear regression model.\nCONCLUSIONS: We suggest that chronic subclinical inflammation is part of IRS. CRP, a predictor of cardiovascular events in previous reports, was independently related to S(I). These findings suggest potential benefits of anti-inflammatory or insulin-sensitizing treatment strategies in healthy individuals with features of IRS.\n## Response:\n"}

There were no significant differences in quantitative insulin sensitivity check index and other measures of insulin sensitivity; however, we observed trends toward lower 2-hour insulin and lower 2-hour glucose. We also observed a protective effect of vitamin D on blood pressure.\nCONCLUSION(S): In women with PCOS, insulin sensitivity was unchanged with high-dose vitamin D, but there was a trend toward decreased 2-hour insulin and a protective effect on blood pressure.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT00907153.\n## Response:\n"}

To measure medication adherence, electronic monitoring is regarded as superior to pill count. GLORIA is an ongoing two-year trial on the addition of low-dose (5\u2009mg/d) prednisolone or placebo to standard care in older people (65+ years) with RA. During the entire trial, adherence is measured with electronic caps, and with pill counts. The objective is to describe medication adherence patterns, and to compare the adherence results of the two methods.\nMETHODS: The recorded adherence patterns of patients (blinded for treatment group) were classified according to descriptive categories. The cutoff for good adherence was set at 80% of prescribed pills taken.\nRESULTS: Trial inclusion closed in 2018 at 451 patients, but trial follow-up is ongoing; the current dataset contains adherence data of 371 patients. Mean number of recorded 90-day periods per patient was 4 (range 1-8). Based on pill count over all periods, 90% of the patients had good adherence; based on cap data, only 20%. Cap data classified 30% of patients as non-user (<20% of days an opening) and 40% as irregular user (different adherence patterns, in or between periods).\nCONCLUSION: In our trial of older people with RA, the majority appeared to be adherent to medication according to pill count. Results from caps conflicted with those of pill counts, with patterns suggesting patients did not use the bottle for daily dispensing, despite specific advice to do so.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02585258.

The primary outcome was the change from baseline to cycle 6 for all indices.\nRESULTS: All parameters were similar at baseline between the two groups. Over six cycles, NOMAC/E2 had less effect on most haemostatic indices than LNG/EE. Lipids were essentially unchanged with NOMAC/E2, whereas with LNG/EE high-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides slightly increased. NOMAC/E2 induced negligible changes in glucose and insulin parameters, in contrast to LNG/EE. A much smaller increase in CRP was observed with NOMAC/E2 than with LNG/EE. NOMAC/E2 was associated with a greater increase in SHBG.\nCONCLUSIONS: The monophasic COC NOMAC/E2 had less influence on haemostasis, lipids and carbohydrate metabolism than the COC LNG/EE.\n## Response:\n"}

Persistent marked homocysteinemia appears to be the most important biochemical disturbance leading to these complications. Ten patients with cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency that was not responsive to pyridoxine and one patient with homocystinuria due to a defect in cobalamin metabolism were treated with 6 g daily of betaine added to conventional therapy, to improve homocysteine remethylation. All patients had a substantial decrease in plasma total homocysteine levels (P less than 0.001) and an increase in total cysteine levels (P less than 0.001). Changes in plasma methionine concentrations were variable. Fasting levels of plasma amino acids became normal in two patients, and in six there was immediate clinical improvement. There were no unwanted effects. We conclude that treatment of homocystinuria that is not responsive to pyridoxine and of disorders of homocysteine remethylation should include betaine in adequate doses to ensure maximum lowering of elevated plasma homocysteine levels.\n## Response:\n"}

This pilot study sought to explore the feasibility of improving socioeconomic inclusion outcomes by bolstering identity capital (sense of purpose and control, self-efficacy and self-esteem) among young people who had experienced homelessness.\nMETHODS: Nineteen individuals (aged 18-26) who had transitioned out of homelessness within the past three years participated in a six-week, six-session program focused on building identity capital. The study employed a mixed method prospective cohort hybrid design with an intervention group (Group One) and a delayed intervention comparison group (Group Two). Participants were interviewed every three months until nine months post-intervention.\nRESULTS: None of the youth who began the intervention dropped out of the program, with the exception of one participant who moved across the country and was unable to continue. Immediately after participating in the intervention, Group One had statistically significant improvements (p < .05) and large to very large effect sizes in self-esteem (d = 1.16) and physical community integration (d = 1.79) compared to changes in Group Two over the same period, which had not yet begun the intervention. In the pooled analysis, small to moderate effect sizes in hopelessness, physical community integration, and self-esteem were observed at all post-intervention time points. Notably, at six- and nine-months post-intervention, statistically significant improvements (p < .05) and moderate effect sizes in hopelessness (d = -0.73 and d = -0.60 respectively) and self-esteem (d = 0.71 and d = 0.53 respectively) were observed. Youth shared they appreciated the normalizing (vs. pathologizing) of strategies they needed to learn and spoke of the importance of framing new skills as something one needs \"to have a better life\" vs. \"to get better.\"\nCONCLUSIONS: These early findings signal that targeting identity capital is feasible and may be a promising approach to incorporate into a more complex intervention that includes housing, education, and employment supports to help youth transition out of homelessness. Future research could build on these findings through a sufficiently powered randomized controlled trial.\n## Response:\n"}

Psychotomimetic symptoms, dissociation and hemodynamic changes are known side effects of ketamine, but it is unclear if these side effects relate to its antidepressant efficacy.\nMETHODS: Data from 108 treatment-resistant inpatients meeting criteria for major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder who received a single subanesthetic ketamine infusion were analyzed. Pearson correlations were performed to examine potential associations between rapid changes in dissociation and psychotomimesis with the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS) and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), respectively, manic symptoms with Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), and vital sign changes, with percent change in the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating scale (HDRS) at 40 and 230min and Days 1 and 7.\nRESULTS: Pearson correlations showed significant association between increased CADSS score at 40min and percent improvement with ketamine in HDRS at 230min (r=-0.35, p=0.007) and Day 7 (r=-0.41, p=0.01). Changes in YMRS or BPRS Positive Symptom score at 40min were not significantly correlated with percent HDRS improvement at any time point with ketamine. Changes in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and pulse were also not significantly related to HDRS change.\nLIMITATIONS: Secondary data analysis, combined diagnostic groups, potential unblinding.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among the examined mediators of ketamine\u05f3s antidepressant response, only dissociative side effects predicted a more robust and sustained antidepressant. Prospective, mechanistic investigations are critically needed to understand why intra-infusion dissociation correlates with a more robust antidepressant efficacy of ketamine.\n## Response:\n"}

Week 12\nAbstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The metabolic syndrome is associated with increased risk for development of both cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes in humans. Because experimental data and clinical experience have shown that metabolic syndrome and caloric restriction have, at least partly, opposite pathophysiological pathways, the activation of sirtuins may constitute a pharmacological approach to treat metabolic syndrome. Resveratrol is a polyphenol produced by plants that has multiple beneficial activities similar to those associated with caloric restriction.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Through its regulatory action of both AMP kinase and the sirtuin sirtuin-1, resveratrol is a natural sirtuin activator that certainly will be the head of a new pharmacological family of drugs targeted on sirtuin-1 activity exacerbation in order to treat/protect from obesity and diabetes, and thus metabolic syndrome.\nSUMMARY: This review discusses the therapeutic use of resveratrol and sirtuin activators in the context of insulin resistance and obesity, the two main features of metabolic syndrome.\n## Response:\n"}

Those with isolated anterior (leads V(1) to V(4)) ST-segment depression were analyzed. Angiograms and ECGs were interpreted by local investigators.\nRESULTS: There were 1,198 (8.8%) patients with isolated anterior ST-segment depression. Of those, 314 (26.2%) had an occluded culprit artery (TIMI flow grade 0/1) and +Tn, 641 (53.5%) had a patent culprit artery (TIMI flow grade 2/3) and +Tn, and 243 (20.3%) had TIMI flow grade 2/3 and -Tn. Among patients with an occluded artery, the culprit artery was most often the left circumflex artery (48.4%). The 30-day incidence of the composite of death and MI was significantly higher among patients with an occluded artery (8.6%) than among those with a patent culprit artery and either +Tn (6.3%) or -Tn (2.9%) (3-way p = 0.006). Among patients with an occluded artery, the median time from ECG to percutaneous coronary intervention was 29.4 h (interquartile range 26.1 to 44.1 h).\nCONCLUSIONS: Among ACS patients presenting with isolated anterior ST-segment depression, over one-quarter had an occluded culprit artery and elevated cardiac biomarkers. These patients had significantly worse clinical outcomes, and few underwent urgent angiography.\n## Response:\n"}

The primary efficacy end points were time to hemostasis (TTH) and time to ambulation (TTA), and the primary safety end points were periprocedural and 30-day incidence of arterial access-related complications.\nRESULTS: The trial assigned 401 patients (mean age 62.7 +/- 10.9 years, 66.1% men) to VCD (n = 267) versus MC (n = 134) after 87 \"roll-in\" patients treated at 17 participating institutions. The baseline characteristics of the groups were similar. Procedural success was 91.8% in the VCD versus 91.0% in the MC group (p = NS). Mean TTH was 4.4 +/- 11.6 min in the VCD versus 20.1 +/- 22.5 min in the MC group (95% confidence interval: 19.0 to 12.3; p < 0.0001). Likewise, TTA was significantly shorter in the VCD (2.5 +/- 5.0 h) than in the MC (6.2 +/- 13.3 h) group (95% confidence interval: 5.5 to 1.9; p = 0.0028). No patient died or suffered a major access-site-related adverse event. Minor adverse events were few among all study groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: After 6-F percutaneous invasive procedures, TTH and TTA were both significantly shorter in patients assigned to VCD than in patients managed with MC. The 30-day rates of access-site-related complications were remarkably low in all groups. (Safety and Effectiveness Study of the Ensure Medical Vascular Closure Device; NCT00345631).\n## Response:\n"}

This study evaluated the efficacy of the Pleasant Events Program (PEP), a 6-week Behavioral Activation intervention designed to reduce CVD risk and depressive symptoms in caregivers. One hundred dementia family caregivers were randomized to either the 6-week PEP intervention (N = 49) or a time-equivalent Information-Support (IS) control condition (N = 51). Assessments were completed pre- and post-intervention and at 1-year follow-up. Biological assessments included CVD risk markers Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and D-dimer. Psychosocial outcomes included depressive symptoms, positive affect, and negative affect. Participants receiving the PEP intervention had significantly greater reductions in IL-6 (p = .040), depressive symptoms (p = .039), and negative affect (p = .021) from pre- to post-treatment. For IL-6, clinically significant improvement was observed in 20.0% of PEP participants and 6.5% of IS participants. For depressive symptoms, clinically significant improvement was found for 32.7% of PEP vs 11.8% of IS participants. Group differences in change from baseline to 1-year follow-up were non-significant for all outcomes. The PEP program decreased depression and improved a measure of physiological health in older dementia caregivers. Future research should examine the efficacy of PEP for improving other CVD biomarkers and seek to sustain the intervention's effects.\n## Response:\n"}

We identified 911 cases where a scalp-pH was obtained, including 53 cases with cord artery acidemia (pH < 7.06). Lag times between ST events and scalp-pH and time to delivery were related to cord artery metabolic and respiratory acidosis and neonatal outcome.\nRESULTS: 43 fetuses were identified by CTG plus ST as being in need of intervention 31 (25-46) minutes before delivery (median, 95% Cl). In five, no indications were given and in another five there were inadequate data. Fifteen cases with metabolic acidosis required special neonatal care, all 14 cases adequately monitored on STAN had indications to intervene for 19 minutes or more. In 30 adequately recorded cases, fetal blood sampling (FBS) was obtained within the last hour of labor. In 22 cases, FBS was obtained 13 (7-24) minutes after STAN guidelines had indicated abnormality and in eight no ST changes had occurred at time of FBS. The corresponding FBS data were pH 7.10 (7.01-7.15) and pH 7.21 (7.08-7.31), respectively, P = 0.01. In cases of metabolic acidosis, scalp-pH fell 0.01 units per minute after a baseline T/QRS rise was recorded during the second stage of labor. Apart from one newborn that died at 2 h from E. Coli septicemia, none of the neonates were affected neurologically.\nCONCLUSION: Cardiotocography plus ST analysis provides accurate information about intrapartum hypoxia similar to that obtained by scalp-pH.\n## Response:\n"}

Week 4 and Week 12\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the literature regarding the efficacy and safety of nonestrogen treatments for menopause-associated vasomotor symptoms not due to cancer or chemotherapy.\nDATA SOURCES: Pertinent literature and clinical studies were identified by searching MEDLINE (1966-February 2004) and EMBASE (1959-February 2004) using the key search terms vasomotor symptoms, hot flashes, and menopause. Bibliographies of relevant articles were reviewed for additional references.\nSTUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: English-language articles reporting efficacy and safety of nonestrogen treatment modalities for perimenopausal and postmenopausal vasomotor symptoms were evaluated. All articles identified from the data sources were evaluated, and all information deemed relevant was included. Emphasis was placed on randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials, as these provide the best efficacy and safety data. Studies evaluating treatment of vasomotor symptoms from other causes, such as cancer or chemotherapy, were excluded.\nDATA SYNTHESIS: Prescription medications reviewed for efficacy and safety in postmenopausal vasomotor symptoms include clonidine hydrochloride, danazol, gabapentin, methyldopa, mirtazapine, progestins, propranolol hydrochloride, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and venlafaxine. Nonprescription therapies reviewed include black cohosh, dong quai, evening primrose oil, physical activity, phytoestrogens, and red clover.\nCONCLUSIONS: According to this systematic literature review, postmenopausal vasomotor treatments that have been shown to be safe and effective in short-term use include black cohosh, exercise, gabapentin, medroxyprogesterone acetate, SSRIs (ie, paroxetine hydrochloride), and soy protein. Initial, small reports are suggestive for efficacy in menopausal vasomotor symptoms with megestrol acetate and venlafaxine.\n## Response:\n"}

This study evaluated a telehealth application to support family dementia caregivers providing homecare. We explored feasibility of in-home video monitoring and feedback to help caregivers and reduce caregiving burden. A caregiver-patient dyad was recruited from a Midwestern University Alzheimer's Disease Center. The caregiver triggered video recordings on a laptop computer using a remote control that also recorded 5 min prior to pressing \"record.\" Recordings were automatically uploaded via the Internet for interdisciplinary team review and feedback. Issues related to Internet transfer and storage of health information and computer security were addressed. Professionals reported the value of video recordings for identifying antecedents and evaluating caregiver responses. The caregiver reported improved communication and behavior management and ease of use.

This study was proposed to quantify the magnitude of the problem.\nMETHODS: Fifteen patients undergoing gastric bypass had oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) recorded continuously, but not displayed, for 24h postoperatively; eight also had arterial blood analysis every 4h. All received narcotic PCA. SpO(2)<90% lasting more than 10 s was reviewed. Results are mean+/-SEM.\nRESULTS: Mean age was 44+/-4 y, and mean BMI was 48+/-2kg/m(2); 77% had OSA. Every patient had more than one episode with SpO(2)<90% for longer than 30s undetected by routine monitoring; most had multiple episodes. Nadir SpO(2) averaged 75% +/- 8%. Mean longest duration of desaturation below 90% averaged 21+/-15min. Mean PaCO(2) was 37+/-3mm Hg; maximum PaCO(2) was 47mm Hg.\nCONCLUSIONS: Severe and prolonged episodes of hypoxemia were a consistent finding, despite aggressive preoperative diagnosis and treatment of OSA, including use of CPAP postoperatively. Although some postoperative hypoventilation was expected, the degree and frequency of desaturation were surprising. No patient exhibited arterial PaCO(2) evidence of hypoventilation. No patient experienced cardiopulmonary arrest/instability, in spite of severe, repeated episodes of hypoxemia. In no instance was a significant hypoxemic episode suspected or detected. Continuous pulse oximetry monitoring, with an audible alarm set for a saturation less than 90% for 10 s, would have alerted providers to 100% of significant hypoxemic episodes. Our recommendation is routinely monitoring (with alarm capability enabled) every bariatric surgical patient, to prevent such occurrence.\n## Response:\n"}

Another 13 teeth were capped with Dycal as controls. The teeth were restored, with IRM, clinically reviewed and extracted after a number of pre-determined intervals (1 week, 1 month and 3 months). The specimens were fixed, decalcified, subdivided axially into two halves in the oro-buccal (lingual-buccal) plane, embedded in plastic, serial sectioned and evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively by correlative light and transmission electron microscopy with appropriate statistical evaluation of the quantitative data.\nRESULTS: Iatrogenic pulpal wounds treated with MTA were mostly free from inflammation after 1 week and became covered with a compact, hard tissue barrier of steadily increasing length and thickness within 3 months following capping. Control teeth treated with Dycal revealed distinctly less consistent formation of a hard tissue barrier that had numerous tunnel defects. The presence of pulpal inflammation up to the longest observation period (3 months) after capping, was a common feature in Dycal specimens.\nCONCLUSIONS: The MTA was clinically easier to use as a direct pulp-capping agent and resulted in less pulpal inflammation and more predictable hard tissue barrier formation than Dycal. Therefore, MTA or equivalent products should be the material of choice for direct pulp capping procedures instead of hard setting calcium hydroxide cements.\n## Response:\n"}

Week 12\nAbstract: AIM: Dapagliflozin is a stable, competitive, reversible, and highly selective inhibitor of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2, the major transporter responsible for renal glucose reabsorption. With an insulin-independent mechanism of action, dapagliflozin is currently being developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This work aims to compare the efficacy of dapagliflozin, as measured by the change in hemoglobin A1c concentration (A1c) and body weight, and to determine the pharmacodynamic effects of dapagliflozin, as measured by urinary glucose excretion in early-stage and late-stage T2DM patient populations.\nMETHODS: A total of 151 early-stage patients and 58 late-stage patients with T2DM randomly assigned 10 or 20 mg once daily (QD) dapagliflozin treatment or placebo for 12 weeks from two phase 2 studies were included in the analysis. A1c, body weight, and urinary glucose were compared between the two patient populations.\nRESULTS: Compared with the early-stage population, patients in the late-stage population had a longer duration of T2DM and higher baseline levels of A1c, body weight, fasting plasma glucose, and urinary glucose excretion. After 12 weeks of dapagliflozin treatment, A1c reduction, weight loss, and increased urinary glucose excretion from baseline were observed in both populations. Baseline A1c level impacted the A1c reduction after dapagliflozin treatment with a comparable effect in patients with early and late stage disease. Late-stage patients had greater reduction in body weight. There was no statistically significant difference in the amount of urinary glucose excretion between the early-stage and late-stage patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin treatment at 10 and 20 mg QD for 12 weeks resulted in significant improvement in glycaemic control and body weight reduction in both early-stage and late-stage patients with T2DM. The findings suggest that dapagliflozin could be a promising treatment option for a wide range of patients with T2DM.\n## Response:\n"}

For patients, the cost includes their dissatisfaction and reduced quality of care. An automated telephone appointment reminder system may decrease the no-show rate. Understanding characteristics of patients who miss their appointments will aid in the formulation of interventions to reduce no-show rates.\nMETHODS: In an academic outpatient practice, we studied patient acceptance and no-show rates among patients receiving a clinic staff reminder (STAFF), an automated appointment reminder (AUTO), and no reminder (NONE). Patients scheduled for appointments in the spring of 2007 were assigned randomly to 1 of 3 groups: STAFF (n=3266), AUTO (n=3219), or NONE (n=3350). Patients in the STAFF group were called 3 days in advance by front desk personnel. Patients in the AUTO group were reminded of their appointments 3 days in advance by an automated, standardized message. To evaluate patient satisfaction with the STAFF and AUTO, we surveyed patients who arrived at the clinic (n=10,546).\nRESULTS: The no-show rates for patients in the STAFF, AUTO, and NONE groups were 13.6%, 17.3%, and 23.1%, respectively (pairwise, P<.01 by analysis of variance for all comparisons). Cancellation rates in the AUTO and STAFF groups were significantly higher than in the NONE group (P<.004). Appointment reminder group, age, visit type, wait time, division specialty, and insurance type were significant predictors of no-show rates. Patients found appointment reminders helpful, but they could not accurately remember whether they received a clinic staff reminder or an automated appointment reminder.\nCONCLUSIONS: A clinic staff reminder was significantly more effective in lowering the no-show rate compared with an automated appointment reminder system.\n## Response:\n"}

At baseline and 4-week intervals, patients completed the OAB-q [symptom bother and health-related quality of life (HRQL) scales] and 3-day bladder diaries; other patient-reported outcome measures were also assessed at baseline and week 12. The primary efficacy end-point was the change from baseline to end of treatment (EOT) on the OAB-q Symptom Bother scale. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored.\nRESULTS: At EOT, solifenacin (n = 377) vs. placebo (n = 374) significantly improved mean symptom bother (-29.9 vs. -20.4, p < 0.0001), HRQL total (25.3 vs. 16.7, p < 0.0001) and all HRQL domain scores (Ps < 0.0001). Solifenacin vs. placebo significantly improved daily episodes of urgency, incontinence and frequency but not nocturia. Significant separation from placebo was evident as early as week 4. Overall, significantly more solifenacin vs. placebo patients reported treatment benefit (84% vs. 63%), satisfaction (80% vs. 59%) and willingness to continue (79% vs. 60%; Ps< 0.0001). Treatment-related AEs in solifenacin vs. placebo patients were dry mouth (13% vs. 2%), constipation (8% vs. 2%) and dry eye (2% vs. 0.3%).\nCONCLUSIONS: As early as week 4 and through EOT, flexibly dosed solifenacin significantly improved OAB symptom bother and HRQL as well as the symptoms of urgency, frequency and incontinence compared with placebo. Significantly more solifenacin patients reported treatment benefit and satisfaction at week 12 compared with placebo.\n## Response:\n"}

To characterize more thoroughly the change in muscle activation patterns of people with LBP in response to a perturbation of standing balance, and to gain insight into the influence of early- vs. late-phase postural responses (differentiated by estimates of voluntary reaction times), this study evaluated the intermuscular patterns of electromyographic (EMG) activations from 24 people with and 21 people without a history of chronic, recurrent LBP in response to 12 directions of support surface translations. Two-factor general linear models examined differences between the 2 subject groups and 12 recorded muscles of the trunk and lower leg in the percentage of trials with bursts of EMG activation as well as the amplitudes of integrated EMG activation for each perturbation direction. The subjects with LBP exhibited 1) higher baseline EMG amplitudes of the erector spinae muscles before perturbation onset, 2) fewer early-phase activations at the internal oblique and gastrocnemius muscles, 3) fewer late-phase activations at the erector spinae, internal and external oblique, rectus abdominae, and tibialis anterior muscles, and 4) higher EMG amplitudes of the gastrocnemius muscle following the perturbation. The results indicate that a history of LBP associates with higher baseline muscle activation and that EMG responses are modulated from this activated state, rather than exhibiting acute burst activity from a quiescent state, perhaps to circumvent trunk displacements.\n## Response:\n"}

It is hypothesized that these stress effects on the course and outcome of psoriasis are caused by neuroendocrine modulation of immune functions. Therefore we investigated the cardiovascular, endocrine and immunological response to a laboratory stressor in psoriasis patients and healthy controls.\nMETHODS: Untreated (n = 7) and PUVA-treated (n = 4) psoriatics and healthy controls (n = 7) were exposed to a brief laboratory stressor (public speaking and mental arithmetic). Heart rate and blood pressure, catecholamine, cortisol, and DHEA plasma concentration, as well as distribution of T and NK lymphocytes were analyzed before, immediately after and 1 h after stress exposure.\nRESULTS: Heart rate and blood pressure increased in all three groups during stress exposure with the most pronounced changes in PUVA-treated patients. Psoriasis patients displayed higher adrenaline values but diminished cortisol and DHEA plasma concentrations compared to controls. NK cell numbers (CD16+, CD56+), but not T lymphocyte subsets, increased immediately after stress exposure in untreated patients and controls. This effect was significantly diminished in PUVA-treated patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: The data of this pilot study indicate an enhanced stress-induced autonomic response and diminished pituitary-adrenal activity in psoriasis patients. PUVA treatment seems to interfere with the cardiovascular and NK cell response to acute psychological stress. Future studies will analyze the stress-induced neuroimmunological mechanisms in psoriatics in more detail.\n## Response:\n"}

This single-center, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized (1:1) clinical trial was designed to assess the effect on patient outcome of vitamin D supplementation in neurocritical care patients with hypovitaminosis D.\nMETHODS: From October 2016 until April 2018, emergently admitted neurocritical care patients with vitamin D deficiency (\u2264 20 ng/ml) were randomized to receive vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, 540,000 IU) (n = 134) or placebo (n = 133). Hospital length of stay (LOS) was the primary outcome; secondary outcomes included intensive care unit (ICU) LOS, repeat vitamin D levels, patient complications, and patient disposition. Exploratory analysis evaluated specific subgroups of patients by LOS, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, and Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II).\nRESULTS: Two-hundred seventy-four patients were randomized (intent-to-treat) and 267 were administered treatment within 48 hours of admission (as-treated; 61.2% of planned recruitment) and monitored. The mean age of as-treated patients was 54.0 \u00b1 17.2 years (56.9% male, 77.2% white). After interim analysis suggested a low conditional power for outcome difference (predictive power 0.12), the trial was halted. For as-treated patients, no significant difference in hospital LOS (10.4 \u00b1 14.5 days vs 9.1 \u00b1 7.9 days, p = 0.4; mean difference 1.3, 95% CI -1.5 to 4.1) or ICU LOS (5.8 \u00b1 7.5 days vs 5.4 \u00b1 6.4 days, p = 0.4; mean difference 0.4, 95% CI -1.3 to 2.1) was seen between vitamin D3 and placebo groups, respectively. Vitamin D3 supplementation significantly improved repeat serum levels compared with placebo (20.8 \u00b1 9.3 ng/ml vs 12.8 \u00b1 4.8 ng/ml, p < 0.001) without adverse side effects. No subgroups were identified by exclusion of LOS outliers or segregation by GCS score, SAPS II, or severe vitamin D deficiency (\u2264 10 ng/ml).\nCONCLUSIONS: Despite studies showing that vitamin D can predict prognosis, supplementation in vitamin D-deficient neurocritical care patients did not result in appreciable improvement in outcomes and likely does not play a role in acute clinical recovery.Clinical trial registration no.: NCT02881957 (clinicaltrials.gov).\n## Response:\n"}

The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine low-frequency (0.008\u2009<\u2009f\u2009<\u20090.08\u2009Hz) coherence of cognitively relevant and sensory brain networks in older adults who participated in a 1-year intervention trial, comparing the effects of aerobic and non-aerobic fitness training on brain function and cognition. Results showed that aerobic training improved the aging brain's resting functional efficiency in higher-level cognitive networks. One year of walking increased functional connectivity between aspects of the frontal, posterior, and temporal cortices within the Default Mode Network and a Frontal Executive Network, two brain networks central to brain dysfunction in aging. Length of training was also an important factor. Effects in favor of the walking group were observed only after 12 months of training, compared to non-significant trends after 6 months. A non-aerobic stretching and toning group also showed increased functional connectivity in the DMN after 6 months and in a Frontal Parietal Network after 12 months, possibly reflecting experience-dependent plasticity. Finally, we found that changes in functional connectivity were behaviorally relevant. Increased functional connectivity was associated with greater improvement in executive function. Therefore the study provides the first evidence for exercise-induced functional plasticity in large-scale brain systems in the aging brain, using functional connectivity techniques, and offers new insight into the role of aerobic fitness in attenuating age-related brain dysfunction.\n## Response:\n"}

We enrolled 168 substance-using women who had not yet completed an estimated 28 weeks of pregnancy. Obstetrical clinicians provided brief advice, and study nurses administered manualized MET-CBT. The primary outcome was percentage of days in the prior 28 days in which alcohol and/or drugs were used immediately before and 3 months postdelivery.\nRESULTS: There were no significant differences across groups in terms of self-reported percentage of days in which drugs or alcohol were used prior to and 3 months postdelivery. Biological measures showed similar results. There was a trend (P=.08) for lower risk of preterm birth among those who received MET-CBT.\nCONCLUSIONS: The tested interventions had similar therapeutic effects. Hence, both treatments may be suitable for pregnant substance users, depending on the population, setting and provider availability.

The post dural puncture headache rate was 81%. Of the 81 parturients with post dural puncture headache, 58 (72%) received a therapeutic epidural blood patch, using 7 to 25 mL of autologous blood. After the initial blood patch, complete relief of headache was obtained in 67% and complete or partial relief in 95%. However, severe headache returned in 31% and 28% received more than one blood patch. The incidence of complete relief of headache with one blood patch or more was 50%, with 38% achieving partial relief and 12% having unrelieved headache. There was no significant association between volume of blood used for blood patch and success rate. The initial rate of resolution of headache did not differ significantly between parturients receiving a blood patch within 48 h of dural puncture and after 48 h (P =0.70). However, in the former group, the incidence of recurrent headache was significantly higher (59% versus 11%, P<0.001).\n## Response:\n"}

The aim of this study was to determine whether ELT therapy for all patients newly started on HPN would reduce the incidence of CRBSI.\nMETHODS: This study was a prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial that was carried out from July 2014 to April 2016. The study participants were patients newly started on HPN, and they were randomly assigned to either treatment with ELT or our current standard of care with saline heparin locks. The primary outcome was occurrence of CRBSI.\nRESULTS: Thirty eight patients that were newly started on HPN were randomized to either treatment with ELT (n\u00a0=\u00a018) or to our current standard of care with heparin locks (n\u00a0=\u00a020). Four patients in the ELT group and one patient in the control arm had a CRBSI (p\u00a0=\u00a00.17). No significant adverse side effects were noted during the study.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study did not show improvement in the rate of CRBSI with ELT in all patients started on HPN. ELT therapy may be most helpful to reduce in CRBSI in high-risk HPN patients, but further studies with a randomized control trial design of high-risk patients are needed to further clarify this important issue in HPN patients.

To assess whether prophylactic anticoagulation can safely reduce the frequency of venous and arterial thrombosis, hospitalization, and death in nonhospitalized patients with symptomatic COVID-19 and at least one thrombosis risk factor, we conducted the PREVENT-HD double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial (A Study of Rivaroxaban to Reduce the Risk of Major Venous and Arterial Thrombotic Events, Hospitalization and Death in Medically Ill Outpatients With Acute, Symptomatic COVID-19] Infection).\nMETHODS: PREVENT-HD was conducted between August 2020 and April 2022 at 14 US integrated health care delivery networks. A virtual trial design used remote informed consent and clinical monitoring and facilitated data collection through electronic health record integration with a cloud-based research platform. Nonhospitalized patients with symptomatic COVID-19 and at least one thrombosis risk factor were enrolled and randomly assigned to either 10 mg of oral rivaroxaban or placebo daily for 35 days. The primary efficacy outcome was time to first occurrence of a composite of symptomatic venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, acute limb ischemia, non-central nervous system systemic arterial embolism, hospitalization, or death through day 35. The principal safety end point was International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis critical-site or fatal bleeding. The last study visit was on day 49.\nRESULTS: The study was terminated prematurely because of enrollment challenges and a lower-than-expected blinded pooled event rate. A total of 1284 patients underwent randomization with complete accrual of primary events through May 2022. No patients were lost to follow-up. The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 22 of 641 in the rivaroxaban group and 19 of 643 in the placebo group (3.4% versus 3.0%; hazard ratio, 1.16 [95% CI, 0.63-2.15]; \nCONCLUSIONS: The study was terminated prematurely after enrollment of 32% of planned accrual because of recruitment challenges and lower-than-expected event rate. Rivaroxaban prescribed for 35 days in nonhospitalized patients with symptomatic COVID-19 at risk for thrombosis did not appear to reduce a composite end point of venous and arterial thrombotic events, hospitalization, and death.\nREGISTRATION: URL: https://www.\nCLINICALTRIALS: gov; Unique identifier: NCT04508023.\n## Response:\n"}

Effective psychological therapies for depression are not accessed by most adolescents. Computerised therapy offers huge potential for improving access to treatment.\nAIMS: To test the efficacy of Stressbusters, a Computerised-CBT (C-CBT) programme for depression in young people.\nMETHOD: Multi-site, schools-based, RCT of C-CBT compared to Waiting List, for young people (N = 112; aged 12-16) with significant symptoms of depression, using multiple-informants (adolescents, parents, teachers), with follow-up at 3 and 6 months.\nRESULTS: Relative to being on a Waiting List, C-CBT was associated with statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in symptoms of depression and anxiety according to adolescent self-report; and with a trend towards improvements in depression and anxiety according to parent-report. Improvements were maintained at follow-up. Treatment gains were similar for boys and girls across the participating age range. Treatment effect was partially mediated by changes in ruminative thinking. Teachers rated adolescents as having few emotional or behavioural problems, both before and after intervention. C-CBT had no detectable effect on academic attainment. In the month after intervention, young people who received C-CBT had significantly fewer absences from school than those on the Waiting List.\nCONCLUSIONS: C-CBT shows considerable promise for the treatment of mild-moderate depression in adolescents.\n## Response:\n"}

Compared with non-ARB arm, valsartan add-on arm had fewer primary endpoints (83 vs. 155; HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.42-0.72, P = 0.00001).\nCONCLUSION: Valsartan add-on treatment to improve blood pressure control prevented more cardiovascular events than conventional non-ARB treatment in high-risk hypertensive patients in Japan. These benefits cannot be entirely explained by a difference in blood pressure control.\n## Response:\n"}

Chronically instrumented fetal lambs were subjected to reproducible hypoxia by reduction of the maternal placental blood flow. This was achieved by complete obstruction of the maternal aorta for 60 seconds. The fetuses were divided into an immature (119 to 126 days, n = 10) and a mature group (129 to 141 days, n = 6). Both groups of fetuses had a marked fall in oxygen tension (from 2.43 +/- 0.12 to 1.46 +/- 0.12 and 2.22 +/- 0.15 to 1.11 +/- 0.17 kilopascals [kPa] in the immature and mature groups, respectively) and in oxygen saturation (from 48% +/- 3% to 17% +/- 2% and 49% +/- 3% to 15% +/- 3%, respectively), but only modest changes occurred in pH and carbon dioxide tension. Basal fetal catecholamine concentrations did not differ between the groups but increased more significantly in the mature group with acute hypoxia. An increase in the T wave amplitude of the fetal electrocardiogram occurred in both groups during the latter part of occlusion with peak values shortly after removal of the occlusion. A linear correlation was found between the plasma epinephrine concentration and the T/QRS ratio in the mature group. Fetuses in both groups showed a marked bradycardia of similar magnitude during the occlusion but differed during the early phase of heart rate recovery by a slower acceleration of heart rate in the mature group. In connection with this marked bradycardia, the mature group showed a significant rise in mean arterial blood pressure at end of the occlusion. We suggest that fetal maturity has a significant influence no only on the release of catecholamines during nonacidemic hypoxia but also on the cardiovascular reaction pattern and changes in the ST waveform.\n## Response:\n"}

Patients with IDA and CKD undergoing hemodialysis were randomized 2:1 to ferumoxytol 1.02\u00a0g (2 \u00d7 510\u00a0mg) or iron sucrose 1.0\u00a0g (10 \u00d7 100\u00a0mg) for a 5-week treatment period (TP). Over 11\u00a0months, patients underwent additional 5-week TPs whenever IDA (hemoglobin < 11.5 g/dL and transferrin saturation < 30%) was detected. The primary efficacy endpoint was mean change in hemoglobin from baseline to week 5\u00a0for each TP. Adverse events were recorded during the study.\nRESULTS: Overall, 293 patients received ferumoxytol (n\u00a0=\u00a0196) or iron sucrose (n\u00a0=\u00a097). Ferumoxytol was noninferior to iron sucrose regarding hemoglobin change from baseline to week\u00a05. The mean change in hemoglobin in the ferumoxytol and iron sucrose groups was 0.5 and 0.4 g/dL, respectively, in TP 1 (least-squares mean difference, 0.13; 95% confidence interval, -0.11 to 0.36) and 0.6 and 0.3 g/dL, respectively, in TP 2 (0.30; 0.06\u00a0-\u00a00.55). Treatment-related and serious adverse events were similar in both groups; no new safety signals emerged.\nCONCLUSION: Long-term administration of ferumoxytol has noninferior efficacy and a similar safety profile to iron sucrose when used to treat IDA in patients with CKD undergoing hemodialysis.\u2029.\n## Response:\n"}

AR was diagnosed by means of history, clinical examination and skin prick test. Patients were randomly divided into 3 subgroups a follows: in Group A, 20 units of BTX-A was injected into each nasal cavity (total 40 units); in Group B, 30 units of BTX-A was injected into each nasal cavity (total 60 units); and in Group C, 2 ml of isotonic saline was injected as placebo. The symptoms of AR (rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction, sneezing, itching) were scored by the patient on a six-point scale (from 0 to 5). All of the patients were followed up at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8; at each visit an anterior rhinoscopic examination was done and symptom scores were recorded.\nRESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between Groups A and B in terms of average symptom scores. Rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction and sneezing scores in Groups A and B were significantly better than those in Group C at all time points. Although itching scores were significantly lower at Weeks 1 and 2, there was no difference in the Week 4, 6 and 8 scores in Groups A and B. When total symptom scores were evaluated, the results for Groups A and B were similar but significantly better than those for Group C.\nCONCLUSION: In selected cases, injection of 40 units of BTX-A into the turbinates, as a single agent, may help the symptomatic control of AR for up to 8 weeks.\n## Response:\n"}

Preliminary data from single-group and randomized phase 2 trials suggest that treatment with FTD-TPI in addition to bevacizumab has the potential to extend survival.\nMETHODS: We randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, adult patients who had received no more than two previous chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer to receive FTD-TPI plus bevacizumab (combination group) or FTD-TPI alone (FTD-TPI group). The primary end point was overall survival. Secondary end points were progression-free survival and safety, including the time to worsening of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance-status score from 0 or 1 to 2 or more (on a scale from 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating greater disability).\nRESULTS: A total of 246 patients were assigned to each group. The median overall survival was 10.8 months in the combination group and 7.5 months in the FTD-TPI group (hazard ratio for death, 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49 to 0.77; P<0.001).

The most common adverse events in both groups were neutropenia, nausea, and anemia. No treatment-related deaths were reported. The median time to worsening of the ECOG performance-status score from 0 or 1 to 2 or more was 9.3 months in the combination group and 6.3 months in the FTD-TPI group (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.67).\nCONCLUSIONS: Among patients with refractory metastatic colorectal cancer, treatment with FTD-TPI plus bevacizumab resulted in longer overall survival than FTD-TPI alone.

It has major impact on patients through disability and associated comorbidities. Current treatment strategies have considerably improved the prognosis, but recent innovations (especially biologic drugs and the new class of so-called \"JAK/STAT inhibitors\") have important safety issues and are very costly. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are highly effective in RA, and could reduce the need for expensive treatment with biologic agents. However, despite more than 65\u00a0years of clinical experience, there is a lack of studies large enough to adequately document the benefit/harm balance. The result is inappropriate treatment strategies, i.e. both under-use and over-use of GCs, and consequently suboptimal treatment of RA.\nMETHODS: The GLORIA study is a pragmatic multicentre, 2-year, randomised, double-blind, clinical trial to assess the safety and effectiveness of a daily dose of 5\u00a0mg prednisolone or matching placebo added to standard of care in elderly patients with RA. Eligible participants are diagnosed with RA, have inadequate disease control (disease activity score, DAS28\u2009\u2265\u20092.6), and are\u2009\u2265\u200965\u00a0years. The primary outcome measures are the time-averaged mean value of the DAS28 and the occurrence of serious adverse events\u00a0or adverse events of special interest. During the trial, change in antirheumatic therapy is permitted as clinically indicated, except for GCs. Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility are secondary outcomes. The main challenge is the interpretation of the trial result with two primary endpoints and the pragmatic trial design that allows co-interventions. Another challenge is the definition of safety and the relative lack of power to detect differences between treatment groups. We have chosen to define safety as the number of patients experiencing at least one serious adverse event. We also specify a decision tree to guide our conclusion on the balance of benefit and harm, and our methodology to combat potential confounding caused by co-interventions.\nDISCUSSION: Pragmatic trials minimise impact on daily practice and maximise clinical relevance of the results, but analysis and interpretation of the results is challenging. We expect that the results of this trial are of importance for all rheumatologists who treat elderly patients with RA.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02585258 .

There would be a number of major benefits if guideline enactment systems could reason explicitly about clinical objectives (e.g. whether a goal has been successfully achieved or not, whether it is consistent with prevailing conditions, or how the system should adapt to circumstances where a recommended action has failed to achieve the intended result). Our own guideline specification language, PROforma, includes a simple goal construct to address this need, but the interpretation is unsatisfactory in current enactment engines, and goals have yet to be included in the language semantics. This paper discusses some of the challenges involved in developing an explicit, declarative formalism for goals. As part of this, we report on a study we have undertaken which has identified over 200 goals in the routine management of breast cancer, and outline a tentative formal structure for this corpus.\n## Response:\n"}

Glenoid components fail as a result of their inability to replicate essential properties of the normal glenoid articular surface to achieve durable fixation to the underlying bone, to withstand repeated eccentric loads and glenohumeral translation, and to resist wear and deformation. The possibility of glenoid component failure should be considered whenever a total shoulder arthroplasty has an unsatisfactory result. High-quality radiographs made in the plane of the scapula and in the axillary projection are usually sufficient to evaluate the status of the glenoid component. Failures of prosthetic glenoid arthroplasty can be understood in terms of failure of the component itself, failure of seating, failure of fixation, failure of the glenoid bone, and failure to effectively manage eccentric loading. An understanding of these modes of failure leads to strategies to minimize complications related to prosthetic glenoid arthroplasty.\n## Response:\n"}

Research has demonstrated that contextual errors can be identified using standardized patients.\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate an educational intervention designed to increase physicians' skills in incorporating the patient's context in assessment and management of care and to thereby decrease the rate of contextual errors.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Quasi-randomized controlled trial, with assessments by blinded observers. Fourth-year medical students (n = 124) in internal medicine subinternships at the University of Illinois at Chicago or Jesse Brown Veterans Administration Medical Center between July 2008 and April 2009 and between August 2009 and April 2010 participated and were assessed.\nINTERVENTION: A 4-hour course on contextualization.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Probing for contextual issues in an encounter, probing for medical issues in an encounter, and developing an appropriate treatment plan. Outcomes were assessed using 4 previously validated standardized patient encounters performed by each participant and were adjusted for subinternship site, academic year, time of year, and case scenario.\nRESULTS: Students who participated in the contextualization workshops were significantly more likely to probe for contextual issues in the standardized patient encounters than students who did not (90% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 87%-94% ] vs 62% [95% CI, 54%-69%], respectively) and significantly more likely to develop appropriate treatment plans for standardized patients with contextual issues (69% [95% CI, 57%-81%] vs 22% [95% CI, 12%-32%]. There was no difference between the groups in the rate of probing for medical issues (80% [95% CI, 75%-85%] vs 81% [95% CI, 76%-86%]) or developing appropriate treatment plans for standardized patients with medical issues (54% [95% CI, 42%-67%] vs 66% [95% CI, 53%-79%]).\nCONCLUSION: Medical students who underwent an educational intervention were more likely to contextualize care for individual standardized patients.\n## Response:\n"}

We enrolled 168 substance-using women who had not yet completed an estimated 28 weeks of pregnancy. Obstetrical clinicians provided brief advice, and study nurses administered manualized MET-CBT. The primary outcome was percentage of days in the prior 28 days in which alcohol and/or drugs were used immediately before and 3 months postdelivery.\nRESULTS: There were no significant differences across groups in terms of self-reported percentage of days in which drugs or alcohol were used prior to and 3 months postdelivery. Biological measures showed similar results. There was a trend (P=.08) for lower risk of preterm birth among those who received MET-CBT.\nCONCLUSIONS: The tested interventions had similar therapeutic effects. Hence, both treatments may be suitable for pregnant substance users, depending on the population, setting and provider availability.

Improving or rehabilitating brain functions by modulating excitability with these noninvasive tools is an exciting new area in neuroscience. Since the cerebellum is closely connected with the cerebral regions subserving motor, associative, and affective functions, the cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathways are an interesting target for these new techniques. Targeting the cerebellum represents a novel way to modulate the excitability of remote cortical regions and their functions. This review brings together the studies that have applied cerebellar stimulation, magnetic and electric, and presents an overview of the current knowledge and unsolved issues.

There are very limited data correlating coagulation tests with postoperative bleeding. We evaluated coagulation changes after CPB and after the administration of coagulation products to 75 children. Baseline coagulation tests were obtained and repeated after protamine administration, after transfusion of individual coagulation products, and on arrival in the intensive care unit (ICU). Regression analysis demonstrated no baseline coagulation test to predict postoperative chest tube drainage. Weight and duration of CPB were determined to be the only predictors of bleeding. Further analyses demonstrated that children <8 kg had more bleeding and required more coagulation products than children >8 kg. Postprotamine platelet count and fibrinogen level correlated independently with 24-h chest tube drainage in children <8 kg, whereas postprotamine platelet count and thrombelastographic values did so in patients weighing >8 kg. Platelet administration alone was found to restore effective hemostasis in many patients. With ongoing bleeding, cryoprecipitate improved coagulation parameters and limited blood loss. Fresh-frozen plasma administration after platelets worsened coagulation parameters and was associated with greater chest tube drainage and more coagulation product transfusions in the ICU. Objective data to guide post-CPB component therapy transfusion in children are suggested.\nIMPLICATIONS: Children <8 kg can be expected to have more severe coagulopathies, require more coagulation product transfusions, and bleed more after cardiopulmonary bypass. Correlations between coagulation tests and postoperative chest tube drainage are defined. Platelets and, if necessary, cryoprecipitate optimally restore hemostasis. Fresh-frozen plasma offers no benefits in correcting postcardiopulmonary bypass coagulopathies in children.\n## Response:\n"}

We examined the efficacy and safety of teneligliptin (a DPP-4 inhibitor) added to canagliflozin (an SGLT2 inhibitor) monotherapy in Japanese patients with poorly controlled T2DM as part of the development of a fixed-dose combination of teneligliptin and canagliflozin. Japanese patients treated with canagliflozin (100 mg) for \u226512 weeks were randomized to receive add-on teneligliptin (20 mg; C + T group) or placebo (C + P group) for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) from baseline to Week 24. The between-group differences in reductions from baseline to Week 24 were significantly greater in the C + T group for HbA1c (-0.94%; P < .001). The incidence of adverse events was similar in both groups (55.8% and 49.4% in the C + T and C + P groups, respectively). No episodes of hypoglycaemia were reported. Teneligliptin added to ongoing canagliflozin monotherapy improved glycaemic control and was well tolerated in Japanese patients with inadequately controlled T2DM.\n## Response:\n"}

A grant was received by M. Meikle to conduct the study. In that observational study, all of the TRC objectives were met, with the final 25-item Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) containing eight subscales. The study was published in 2012, and since then the TFI has received increasing international use and is being translated into at least 14 languages. The present study utilized data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that involved testing the efficacy of \"telephone tinnitus education\" as intervention for bothersome tinnitus. These data were used to confirm results from the original TFI study. Overall, the TFI performed well in the RCT with Cohen's d being 1.23. There were large differences between the eight different subscales, ranging from a mean 13.2-point reduction (for the Auditory subscale) to a mean 26.7-point reduction (for the Relaxation subscale). Comparison of TFI performance was made with the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory. All of the results confirmed sensitivity of the TFI along with its subscales.

Repeated testing at conventional critical values can substantially inflate the type I error rate. To maintain acceptable levels, group sequential and stochastic curtailment have been developed for clinical trials. One should not view such methods as absolute rules, but as useful guides. The decision process to terminate a trial early is complex and necessitates an accounting for many factors. The Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial provides an excellent example of many of these issues.\n## Response:\n"}

Time points of measurement: 24 hours after ROSC.\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Animal data on cardiac arrest showed improved long-term survival with combined vasopressin-epinephrine. In cardiac arrest, cortisol levels are relatively low during and after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. We hypothesized that combined vasopressin-epinephrine and corticosteroid supplementation during and after resuscitation may improve survival in refractory in-hospital cardiac arrest.\nMETHODS: We conducted a single-center, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial. We enrolled 100 consecutive patients with cardiac arrest requiring epinephrine according to current resuscitation guidelines. Patients received either vasopressin (20 IU per cardiopulmonary resuscitation cycle) plus epinephrine (1 mg per resuscitation cycle) (study group; n = 48) or isotonic sodium chloride solution placebo plus epinephrine (1 mg per resuscitation cycle) (control group; n = 52) for the first 5 resuscitation cycles after randomization, followed by additional epinephrine if needed. On the first resuscitation cycle, study group patients received methylprednisolone sodium succinate (40 mg) and controls received saline placebo. Postresuscitation shock was treated with stress-dose hydrocortisone sodium succinate (300 mg daily for 7 days maximum, with gradual taper) (27 patients in the study group) or saline placebo (15 patients in the control group). Primary end points were return of spontaneous circulation for 15 minutes or longer and survival to hospital discharge.\nRESULTS: Study group patients vs controls had more frequent return of spontaneous circulation (39 of 48 patients [81%] vs 27 of 52 [52%]; P = .003) and improved survival to hospital discharge (9 [19%] vs 2 [4%]; P = .02). Study group patients with postresuscitation shock vs corresponding controls had improved survival to hospital discharge (8 of 27 patients [30%] vs 0 of 15 [0%]; P = .02), improved hemodynamics and central venous oxygen saturation, and more organ failure-free days. Adverse events were similar in the 2 groups.\nCONCLUSION: In this single-center trial, combined vasopressin-epinephrine and methylprednisolone during resuscitation and stress-dose hydrocortisone in postresuscitation shock improved survival in refractory in-hospital cardiac arrest.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00411879.\n## Response:\n"}

Opioids are commonly used to treat cancer-related pain, but carry the risk of severe side effects, limiting their use. Cebranopadol is a first-in-class drug candidate, combining nociceptin/orphanin FQ peptide and opioid peptide receptor agonism. This trial examined the analgesic efficacy of cebranopadol compared with morphine prolonged release (PR) in patients with moderate-to-severe cancer-related pain.\nMETHODS: This double-blind, parallel-group, multiple-dose trial was designed as noninferiority trial for efficacy of cebranopadol versus morphine PR. Planned with 524 patients, finally 126 patients were treated for up to 7\u00a0weeks (low accrual). The primary efficacy endpoint was the average amount of daily rescue medication intake (morphine immediate release) over the last 2\u00a0weeks of treatment.\nRESULTS: For the primary endpoint, noninferiority of cebranopadol with and superiority over morphine PR were demonstrated (Full Analysis Set: \u2206[95%CI]\u00a0=\u00a0-7.48\u00a0mg [-12.05, -2.92]; Per Protocol Set: \u2206[95%CI]\u00a0=\u00a0-4.67\u00a0mg [-9.25, -0.10]). The vast majority of patients (\u226575%, either treatment) had clinically relevant pain reduction, and noninferiority on this secondary endpoint was not shown. Mostly used doses were \u2264800\u00a0\u03bcg cebranopadol or \u2264120\u00a0mg morphine PR daily. A total of 83.1% of patients on cebranopadol and 82.0% on morphine PR experienced treatment-emergent adverse events.\nCONCLUSIONS: Cebranopadol was effective, safe and well tolerated in the dose range tested (200-1,000\u00a0\u03bcg) in patients suffering from chronic moderate-to-severe cancer-related pain and was superior to morphine PR on the primary endpoint.\nSIGNIFICANCE: Cebranopadol presents a new approach to treat cancer pain. The drug candidate was easy to titrate, safe and well tolerated, and as effective as morphine PR in patients suffering from chronic moderate-to-severe cancer-related pain.\n## Response:\n"}

This trial was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of ataluren in patients with nonsense-mutation cystic fibrosis.\nMETHODS: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study enrolled patients from 36 sites in 11 countries in North America and Europe. Eligible patients with nonsense-mutation cystic fibrosis (aged \u2265 6 years; abnormal nasal potential difference; sweat chloride >40 mmol/L; forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV1] \u2265 40% and \u2264 90%) were randomly assigned by interactive response technology to receive oral ataluren (10 mg/kg in morning, 10 mg/kg midday, and 20 mg/kg in evening) or matching placebo for 48 weeks. Randomisation used a block size of four, stratified by age, chronic inhaled antibiotic use, and percent-predicted FEV1. The primary endpoint was relative change in percent-predicted FEV1 from baseline to week 48, analysed in all patients with a post-baseline spirometry measurement. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00803205.\nFINDINGS: Between Sept 8, 2009, and Nov 30, 2010, 238 patients were randomly assigned, of whom 116 in each treatment group had a valid post-baseline spirometry measurement. Relative change from baseline in percent-predicted FEV1 did not differ significantly between ataluren and placebo at week 48 (-2.5% vs -5.5%; difference 3.0% [95% CI -0.8 to 6.3]; p=0.12). The number of pulmonary exacerbations did not differ significantly between treatment groups (rate ratio 0.77 [95% CI 0.57-1.05]; p=0.0992). However, post-hoc analysis of the subgroup of patients not using chronic inhaled tobramycin showed a 5.7% difference (95% CI 1.5-10.1) in relative change from baseline in percent-predicted FEV1 between the ataluren and placebo groups at week 48 (-0.7% [-4.0 to 2.1] vs -6.4% [-9.8 to -3.7]; nominal p=0.0082), and fewer pulmonary exacerbations in the ataluern group (1.42 events [0.9-1.9] vs 2.18 events [1.6-2.7]; rate ratio 0.60 [0.42-0.86]; nominal p=0.0061). Safety profiles were generally similar for ataluren and placebo, except for the occurrence of increased creatinine concentrations (ie, acute kidney injury), which occurred in 18 (15%) of 118 patients in the ataluren group compared with one (<1%) of 120 patients in the placebo group. No life-threatening adverse events or deaths were reported in either group.\nINTERPRETATION: Although ataluren did not improve lung function in the overall population of nonsense-mutation cystic fibrosis patients who received this treatment, it might be beneficial for patients not taking chronic inhaled tobramycin.\nFUNDING: PTC Therapeutics, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, US Food and Drug Administration's Office of Orphan Products Development, and the National Institutes of Health.\n## Response:\n"}

However, comparisons are scarce and generally focus on survival only. Comparative data on more patient-relevant outcomes are needed to truly foster shared decision-making on an individual level, and cost comparison is needed to assess value of care.\nMETHODS: We conducted a\u00a0retrospective observational single-center cohort study in 366 patients aged \u226570\u00a0years with advanced CKD, who chose dialysis (n\u00a0=\u2009240) or conservative care (n\u00a0=\u2009126) after careful counselling by a multidisciplinary team in a non-academic teaching hospital in The Netherlands. Using a value-based health care approach (value\u2009=\u2009outcomes/cost): survival, health-related quality of life-cross-sectionally assessed with the Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form\u2122-treatment burden, and treatment costs were evaluated.\nRESULTS: The overall survival benefit of patients on a dialysis pathway compared with patients on conservative care diminished or lost significance in patients aged \u226580\u00a0years or with severe comorbidity. There were no differences between patients managed conservatively and dialysis patients on physical and mental health summary scores (all P\u00a0>\u20090.1). Patients on conservative care had 352.7 hospital free days per year versus 282.7 in patients on a dialysis pathway, calculated from treatment decision (adjusted incidence rate ratio: 1.15, 95% confidence interval: 1.09 to 1.21, P\u00a0<\u2009\u00a00.001). Annual treatment costs were lower in patients on conservative care (adjusted cost ratio: 0.43, 95% confidence interval: 0.28 to 0.67, P\u00a0<\u2009\u00a00.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: In this study, conservative care is shown to be a viable treatment option in older patients with advanced CKD, particularly in the oldest old and those with severe comorbidity. By achieving similar outcomes at lower treatment burden and treatment costs, value was generated for older patients choosing conservative care and society.\n## Response:\n"}

There is convincing evidence that active sodium and chloride transporters are expressed in the distal lung epithelium and are responsible for the ability of the lung to remove alveolar fluid at the time of birth as well as in the mature lung when pathological conditions lead to the development of pulmonary edema. Currently, the best described molecular transporters are the epithelial sodium channel, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, Na+-K+-ATPase, and several aquaporin water channels. Both catecholamine-dependent and -independent mechanisms can upregulate isosmolar fluid transport across the distal lung epithelium. Experimental and clinical studies have made it possible to examine the role of these transporters in the resolution of pulmonary edema.\n## Response:\n"}

Twenty patients with partial or no immune response to HAART despite viral suppression were enrolled. Ten were randomized to stay on their current regimen and 10 were randomized to LPV/r plus their current NRTI backbone. T cell subsets, ex vivo apoptosis, and the percent of circulating cells with detectable intracellular HIV-1 RNA were measured. The mean increase in CD4(+) count at 6 months was 116/mm(3) (172-288) for the LPV/r-containing arm versus 32/mm(3) (264-296) for continuation regimens (p = 0.03). The number of patients with an increase \u226550 cells/mm(3) was also greater in the LPV/r arm (7/9 versus 2/10, p = 0.01). This paralleled a decrease in ex vivo apoptosis of naive CD4(+) T cells at 6 months (21.7-11.0% for the LPV/r arm versus 17.3-18.9% for the continuation arm, p = 0.04) and memory cells (21.1-14.1% for LPV/r versus 20.2-17.9% for continuation arm, NSS). Switching patients to an LPV/r-containing regimen improved CD4(+) counts in patients with prior immunologic failure, and this may be due to an effect of LPV/r on apoptosis.\n## Response:\n"}

The primary outcome measure was change in maximum cystometric capacity. Secondary outcome measures included changes in overactive bladder symptoms, post-void residual, maximum detrusor pressure during filling cystometry and reflex detrusor volume. Quality of life was assessed using the Incontinence Impact Questionnaire short form 7 and Urogenital Distress Inventory short form 6. Followup occurred at 4 and 12 weeks after injection, at which point the study was unblinded. Further followup in the botulinum toxin-A group occurred at 24 weeks.\nRESULTS: Significant increases in maximum cystometric capacity were observed at 4 weeks (difference 144.69 ml, 95% CI 100.95 to 215.75, p <0.0001) and 12 weeks (difference 95.71 ml, 95% CI 47.47 to 172.45, p = 0.001) in patients treated with botulinum toxin-A compared to placebo. Botulinum toxin-A reduced frequency (p <0.001, p = 0.003) and urgency urinary incontinence (p = 0.03, p = 0.008) episodes at 4 and 12 weeks, respectively. Urgency was reduced at 4 weeks (p = 0.005) in the botulinum toxin-A group. In patients receiving botulinum toxin-A, post-void residual increased at 4 weeks (p = 0.024) but became insignificant by 12 weeks (p = 0.406). Of these patients 6 required intermittent self-catheterization. Significant improvements in quality of life were observed following botulinum toxin-A. The extension study suggests that the beneficial effects of botulinum toxin-A are maintained for at least 24 weeks.\nCONCLUSIONS: Botulinum toxin-A at 200 U is safe and effective for idiopathic detrusor overactivity and the beneficial effects persist for at least 24 weeks.\n## Response:\n"}

In addition to the PPBC, patients completed two condition-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL) measures, the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire (OAB-q) and King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ), and bladder diaries at baseline and 12 wk. Validity of the PPBC was evaluated through correlations with baseline diaries, OAB-q, and KHQ. The responsiveness of the PPBC was evaluated using correlations and general linear models to assess the degree of association between change in PPBC and change in the diaries, OAB-q, and KHQ.\nRESULTS: Both samples were primarily women and white with mean ages of 61.0 and 58.8 yr. The majority of patients were incontinent (75.3% and 80.4%) with the greatest proportion of patients indicating that they had \"moderate problems\" (47.5% and 51.2%) on the PPBC at baseline. Significant correlations were present at baseline and among change scores between the PPBC and the bladder diaries (p < 0.001), OAB-q (p < 0.001), and KHQ (p < 0.01). In both studies, patients with major PPBC improvement had significantly greater reductions in frequency, urgency episodes, incontinence episodes, and Symptom Bother and significantly greater improvements in HRQL than patients with only a minor PPBC improvement.\nCONCLUSION: The PPBC, a global patient-reported measure of bladder condition, demonstrated good construct validity and responsiveness to change. These findings support the use of the PPBC as a global assessment of bladder condition among patients with OAB.\n## Response:\n"}

Vardenafil was administered at a starting dose of 10 mg, which could be titrated to 5 mg or 20 mg after 4 weeks, depending on efficacy and tolerability.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary efficacy measures were the erectile function domain of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-EF) and Sexual Encounter Profile (SEP) diary questions 2/3. Secondary efficacy measures included SEP1, a diary question assessing ejaculation, the percentage of men achieving \"return-to-normal\" erectile function, and the percentage of men who titrated to a different dose. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded throughout the study.\nRESULTS: The intent-to-treat population included 145 men (vardenafil, N = 75; placebo, N = 70). Baseline least squares IIEF-EF domain scores were low (vardenafil: 12.0; placebo: 12.7), indicative of moderate-to-severe ED. Vardenafil was statistically significantly superior to placebo for all primary efficacy measures (P < 0.0001) and showed nominally statistically significant superiority compared with placebo for SEP1/ejaculation success rates (P = 0.0003 and P < 0.0001, respectively) and the percentage of subjects reporting \"return-to-normal\" erectile function (P = 0.0004). Treatment-emergent AEs were mild-to-moderate in severity and consistent with the known AE profile of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors.\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to assess the efficacy and safety of vardenafil, taken alone, for ED therapy in a population of men who all had metabolic syndrome. Although baseline erectile function in these patients was low, vardenafil treatment was associated with significant improvements in erectile function and rates of successful intercourse, and was well tolerated.\n## Response:\n"}

However, the role of adjunctive metformin, an insulin sensitizer, on glycemic control in these patients is unclear.\nOBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of metformin vs. placebo on hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), total daily dose (TDD) of insulin, and other parameters in overweight/obese youth with T1D.\nHYPOTHESIS: Adjunctive metformin therapy will improve glycemic control in overweight/obese youth with T1D.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A 9-mo randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial of metformin and placebo in 28 subjects (13m/15f) of ages 10-20years (y), with HbA1c >8% (64 mmol/mol), BMI >85%, and T1D > 12 months was conducted at a university outpatient facility. The metformin group consisted of 15 subjects (8 m/ 7f), of age 15.0 \u00b1 2.5 y; while the control group was made up of 13 subjects (5m/ 8f), of age 14.5 \u00b1 3.1y. All participants employed a self-directed treat-to-target insulin regimen based on a titration algorithm of (-2)-0-(+2) units to adjust their long-acting insulin dose every 3rd day from -3 mo through +9 mo to maintain fasting plasma glucose (FPG) between 90-120 mg/dL (5.0-6.7 mmol/L). Pubertal maturation was determined by Tanner stage.\nRESULTS: Over the course of the 9 months of observation, the between-treatment differences in HbA1c of 0.4% (9.85% [8.82 to 10.88] for placebo versus 9.46% [8.47 to 10.46] for metformin) was not significant (p = 0.903). There were non-significant reduction in fasting plasma glucose (189.4 mg/dL [133.2 to 245.6] for placebo versus 170.5 mg/dL [114.3 to 226.7] for metformin), (p = 0.927); total daily dose (TDD) of short-acting insulin per kg body weight/day(p = 0.936); and the TDD of long-acting insulin per kg body weight per day (1.15 units/kg/day [0.89 to 1.41] for placebo versus 0.90 units/kg/day [0.64 to 1.16] for metformin) (p = 0.221). There was no difference in the occurrence of hypoglycemia between the groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: This 9-month RCT of adjunctive metformin therapy in overweight and obese youth with T1D resulted in a 0.4% lower HbA1c value in the metformin group compared to the placebo group.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrial.gov NCT01334125.\n## Response:\n"}

The effect of the leucine metabolite beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) on the reduction of body weight loss and protein degradation in the MAC16 model of cancer-induced weight loss has been compared with that of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), a recognized inhibitor of protein degradation. HMB was found to attenuate the development of weight loss at a dose greater than 0.125 g/kg accompanied by a small reduction in tumor growth rate. When EPA was used at a suboptimal dose level (0.6 g/kg) the combination with HMB seemed to enhance the anticachectic effect. Both treatments caused an increase in the wet weight of soleus muscle and a reduction in protein degradation, although there did not seem to be a synergistic effect of the combination. Proteasome activity, determined by the \"chymotrypsin-like\" enzyme activity, was attenuated by both HMB and EPA. Protein expression of the 20S alpha or beta subunits was reduced by at least 50%, as were the ATPase subunits MSS1 and p42 of the 19S proteasome regulatory subunit. This was accompanied by a reduction in the expression of E2(14k) ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. The combination of EPA and HMB was at least as effective or more effective than either treatment alone. Attenuation of proteasome expression was reflected as a reduction in protein degradation in gastrocnemius muscle of cachectic mice treated with HMB. In addition, HMB produced a significant stimulation of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle. These results suggest that HMB preserves lean body mass and attenuates protein degradation through down-regulation of the increased expression of key regulatory components of the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway, together with stimulation of protein synthesis.\n## Response:\n"}

The core phase (24 weeks) consisted of titration and maintenance periods. This was followed by an optional extension phase (28 weeks), which collected data used to assess long-term safety and efficacy outcomes. Five hundred four subjects were randomized between the 2 treatment groups. The primary efficacy analysis showed that OROS hydromorphone was noninferior to SR oxycodone (P = 0.011) as measured by change in Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) pain severity subscore \"pain right now.\" The treatment difference with respect to change in BPI pain severity subscore \"pain right now\" was 0.29 (95% confidence interval: -0.27 to 0.84). The equianalgesic doses were 16 mg OROS hydromorphone and 40 mg SR oxycodone (median values). Secondary outcomes included other BPI scale items, the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Sleep Indices, and quality of life measured by the Short Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire. Both treatment groups showed improvements in the main secondary efficacy endpoints. No statistically significant differences were shown between the treatment groups, except for the scores for somnolence (MOS sleep subscale) and physical functioning (SF-36), which both had a statistically significant difference between treatments groups in favor of OROS hydromorphone. Both study medications had equivalent and acceptable safety profiles. The results of this open-label study showed that once-daily OROS hydromorphone is a safe and well-tolerated treatment for chronic pain and as efficacious as twice-daily SR oxycodone.\n## Response:\n"}

VAS can also be used in routine patient history taking and to monitor the course of a chronic disease such as allergic rhinitis (AR). More specifically, the VAS has been used to assess effectiveness of AR therapy in real life, both in intermittent and persistent disease.\nMETHODS: This position paper takes a detailed look at the historical development of VAS and its method-specific principles. Particular focus is put on aspects of practical application in daily routine and on a critical discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the individual methods.\nRESULTS: VAS are well validated for the measurement of AR symptoms and correlate well with the ARIA (allergic rhinitis and its impact on asthma) severity classification and also correlated well with rTNSS and RQLQ. Moreover, several treatment studies on AR have used VAS as an evaluation parameter. Thanks to the use of new (real-life and real-time) communication technologies, such as smartphone apps, Discussion: VAS can be used relatively simply and highly effectively to assess disease control. The VAS lends itself very well to digitization and has now been incorporated into a smartphone app (called Allergy Diary) to assess AR control and direct treatment decisions as part of an AR clinical decision support system (CDSS). MASK Rhinitis has developed this app, which is currently available in 15 different languages.\n## Response:\n"}

Behavioral correlates of depression, such as satisfaction with leisure activities (i.e., leisure satisfaction), may also be associated with endothelial function via their association with depressive symptoms. This study examined the longitudinal associations between stress, depressive symptoms, leisure satisfaction, and endothelial function as measured by FMD.\nMETHOD: Participants were 116 older Alzheimer's caregivers (M age = 74.3 \u00b1 8.1; 68% women; 87% white) who underwent 3 yearly assessments of FMD, stress, depressive symptoms, and leisure satisfaction. Mixed-regression analyses were used to examine longitudinal relationships between constructs of interest.\nRESULTS: A significant and positive association was found between leisure satisfaction and FMD (p = .050), whereas a negative relationship was found for stress (p = .017). Depressive symptoms were not associated with FMD (p = .432). Time (p < .001) and the number of years caregiving (p = .027) were also significant predictors of FMD, suggesting that FMD decreased over time and was worse the longer a participant had been a caregiver prior to study enrollment.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that behavioral correlates of depression (i.e., engagement in pleasurable activities) may be related to endothelial function in caregivers, and behavioral treatments for depression may be particularly useful in improving cardiovascular outcomes in caregivers.\n## Response:\n"}

The relationship between endogenous thrombopoietin (THPO) levels and platelet response to romiplostim is unknown. Variables including baseline endogenous THPO levels, transfusion needs, and platelet response were analysed in a randomized trial of 250 thrombocytopenic, lower-risk MDS patients (International Prognostic Scoring System low/intermediate-1). A predictive scoring system was developed based on log-likelihood ratios and logistic coefficients. Patients with HI-P (haematological improvement - platelets) responses had lower mean baseline THPO levels (P = 0\u00b70497) and were more likely to have <6 platelet units transfused in the past year (P = 0\u00b70027), as did patients with platelet responses \u226550% of weeks on romiplostim (P = 0\u00b7001 and P = 0\u00b70037, respectively). A model for predicting response to romiplostim was developed and validated in a separate MDS cohort (N = 72). Patients in low-, intermediate-, and high-response groups had response rates of 17\u00b74%, 29\u00b76%, and 50\u00b77%, respectively, for HI-P, and 17\u00b74%, 33\u00b78%, and 65\u00b72%, respectively, for \u226550% response. For thrombocytopenic patients with lower-risk MDS, lower baseline THPO levels (<500 pg/ml) and limited platelet transfusion history predicted a greater likelihood of a subsequent platelet response to romiplostim.\n## Response:\n"}

It is hypothesised that VNS delivered during rehabilitation will improve upper limb function compared to control rehabilitation therapy. Two pilot clinical studies demonstrated acceptable safety and feasibility of VNS paired with rehabilitation for improved upper limb function after stroke. Participants who received rehabilitation paired with VNS demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in motor function that exceed gains seen among controls who received similar rehabilitation without VNS. These preliminary data support a larger pivotal trial.\nMETHODS: VNS-REHAB (VNS-Rehabilitation) is a pivotal, multi-site, double-blinded, randomised trial designed to evaluate safety and efficacy of VNS paired with upper limb rehabilitation after ischaemic stroke. The study will include up to 120 participants with upper limb weakness due to stroke nine months to 10 years prior. All participants will be implanted with a VNS device and randomised to receive either Active (0.8 mA) or Control VNS (0.0 mA) paired with upper limb rehabilitation. All participants receive 18 sessions of in-clinic therapy for six weeks, followed by a home-based therapy for three months. The rehabilitation therapy involves progressive, functionally based and intensive practice of hand and arm tasks. VNS is delivered during each movement repetition. After blinded follow-up is completed, the Active vagus nerve stimulation group continues with home-based Active VNS and the Control group receive six weeks of in-clinic therapy with Active VNS followed by home-based Active VNS. The primary efficacy endpoint will be the difference in Fugl-Meyer assessment-upper extremity scores between the Active VNS and Control VNS groups at the end of six weeks of in-clinic therapy. Additional secondary endpoints will also be measured. Safety will be assessed with analysis of adverse events and device complications during study participation.\nDISCUSSION: This pivotal trial will determine whether VNS paired with rehabilitation is a safe and effective treatment for improving arm function after stroke.\n## Response:\n"}

Of the 8 secondary outcomes, overall survival, distant relapse-free survival, and breast cancer-free interval were analyzed.\nRESULTS: Of the 3649 randomized patients (mean age, 52.4 years; 3643 women [99.8%]), all (100%) were included in analyses. After a second interim analysis, futility was declared for patients who were ER/PgR-, so the primary analysis was conducted for 2533 patients who were ER/PgR+. The median duration of follow-up in the ER/PgR+ group was 96.2 months (range, 0.2-121 months). Invasive disease-free survival events occurred in 465 patients who were ER/PgR+. The incidence rates for invasive disease-free survival events were 2.78 per 100 patient-years in the metformin group vs 2.74 per 100 patient-years in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.01; 95% CI, 0.84-1.21; P\u2009=\u2009.93), and the incidence rates for death were 1.46 per 100 patient-years in the metformin group vs 1.32 per 100 patient-years in the placebo group (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.86-1.41; P\u2009=\u2009.47). Among patients who were ER/PgR-, followed up for a median of 94.1 months, incidence of invasive disease-free survival events was 3.58 vs 3.60 per 100 patient-years, respectively (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.79-1.30; P\u2009=\u2009.92). None of the 3 secondary outcomes analyzed in the ER/PgR+ group had statistically significant differences. Grade 3 nonhematological toxic events occurred more frequently in patients taking metformin than in patients taking placebo (21.5% vs 17.5%, respectively, P\u2009=\u2009.003). The most common grade 3 or higher adverse events in the metformin vs placebo groups were hypertension (2.4% vs 1.9%), irregular menses (1.5% vs 1.4%), and diarrhea (1.9% vs 7.0%).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with high-risk operable breast cancer without diabetes, the addition of metformin vs placebo to standard breast cancer treatment did not significantly improve invasive disease-free survival.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01101438.\n## Response:\n"}

Adolescents (N = 75) with alcohol misuse, with or without other substance misuse, were enrolled. All youth received individual Motivational Enhancement Therapy/Cognitive Behavior Therapy and weekly urine drug testing. The experimental condition (EXP) included Abstinence Incentives (clinic-based incentives for abstinence from all substances) plus weekly behavioral parent training that included a parent-delivered, abstinence-based, substance monitoring contract. The comparison condition (CONTROL) included Attendance Incentives (ATTI). All adolescents met DSM-IV criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence or reported recent binge drinking, and 77% (N = 58) met criteria for a cannabis use disorder or had recent cannabis use at baseline. Alcohol and cannabis use outcomes were compared across treatment conditions. A similar percentage of youth maintained complete alcohol abstinence across the 36-week follow-up in both conditions. However, among youth not entirely abstinent from alcohol, EXP resulted in a lower percentage of days using alcohol during the 36 weeks after the end of treatment than CONTROL. Among youth who also used cannabis at baseline, results showed similar benefits of EXP on cannabis use days. Combined individual and family based treatment, plus abstinence based incentives can reduce substance use days during and after treatment over and above individual evidence-based psychosocial treatment plus attendance incentives. Future research should focus on identifying cost-effective components and incentive levels and delivery via technology to facilitate dissemination. (PsycINFO Database Record\n## Response:\n"}

Two investigators independently extracted data on study design, sample size and characteristics, type of intervention, type of control, direction and nature of the outcome(s).\nRESULTS: Twenty-five trials met the inclusion criteria. Methodologic quality was assessed, and effect sizes were calculated for 6 outcomes. Significant pooled effect sizes were found postintervention for pain (0.22), functional disability (0.27), psychological status (0.15), coping (0.46), and self efficacy (0.35). At followup (averaging 8.5 months), significant pooled effect sizes were observed for tender joints (0.33), psychological status (0.30), and coping (0.52). No clear or consistent patterns emerged when effect sizes for different types of treatment and control conditions were compared, or when higher quality trials were compared to lower quality ones. Findings do, however, suggest that these psychological interventions may be more effective for patients who have had the illness for shorter duration.\nCONCLUSIONS: Despite some methodologic flaws in the literature, psychological interventions may be important adjunctive therapies in the medical management of RA.\n## Response:\n"}

The primary endpoint was HbA(1c) change from baseline to week 24.\nRESULTS: Once-daily lixisenatide significantly improved HbA(1c) versus placebo (LS mean difference vs. placebo\u2009=\u2009-0.88% [95%CI=\u2009-1.116, -0.650]; p\u2009<\u20090.0001), and allowed more patients to achieve HbA(1c) <7.0% (35.6 vs. 5.2%) and \u2264 6.5% (17.8 vs. 1.3%). Lixisenatide also significantly improved 2-h postprandial plasma glucose and glucose excursion, average 7-point self-monitored blood glucose and fasting plasma glucose.

One hundred fifty-four participants who received the combined intervention were included in this analysis.\nMEASUREMENTS: Pelvic-floor muscle exercise adherence and exercise barriers were assessed during the intervention phase and 1 year afterward. Adherence to UI prevention strategies and delayed voiding were assessed during the intervention only.\nRESULTS: During intervention, 81% of women exercised at least 5 to 6 days per week, and 87% performed at least 30 PFM contractions per day. Ninety-two percent of the women used the urge suppression strategy successfully. At the 12-month follow-up, only 32% of the women exercised at least 5 to 6 days per week, and 56% performed 15 or more PFM contractions on the days they exercised. The most persistent PFM exercise barriers were difficulty remembering to exercise and finding time to exercise. Similarly, difficulty finding time to exercise persisted as a predictor of PFM exercise adherence over time.\nLIMITATIONS: Co-administration of medication for UI may have influenced adherence.\nCONCLUSIONS: Most women adhered to exercise during supervised intervention; however, adherence declined over the long term.

Partial or secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures are often difficult to control adequately with standard treatment, usually carbamazepine or phenytoin.\nMETHODS: We conducted a multicenter, double-blind trial that compared valproate with carbamazepine in the treatment of 480 adults with complex partial seizures (206 patients) or secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures (274 patients). The patients were randomly assigned to treatment with carbamazepine or divalproex sodium (valproate) at doses adjusted to achieve blood levels in the middle of the therapeutic range. Patients were followed for one to five years or until seizures became uncontrollable, treatment had unacceptable adverse effects, or both these events occurred.\nRESULTS: For the control of secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures, carbamazepine and valproate were comparably effective (in 136 patients and 138 patients, respectively). For complex partial seizures, four of five outcome measures favored carbamazepine (100 patients) over valproate (106 patients): the total number of seizures (2.7 vs. 7.6, P = 0.05), the number of seizures per month (0.9 vs. 2.2, P = 0.01), the time to the first seizure (P less than 0.02), and the seizure-rating score (P = 0.04). Carbamazepine was also superior according to a composite score that combined scores for the control of seizures and for adverse effects (P less than 0.001). Valproate was associated more frequently than carbamazepine with a weight gain of more than 5.5 kg (12 lb) (20 percent vs. 8 percent, P less than 0.001), with hair loss or change in texture (12 percent vs. 6 percent, P = 0.02), and with tremor (45 percent vs. 22 percent, P less than 0.001). Rash was more often associated with carbamazepine (11 percent vs. 1 percent, P less than 0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Valproate is as effective as carbamazepine for the treatment of generalized tonic-clonic seizures, but carbamazepine provides better control of complex partial seizures and has fewer long-term adverse effects.\n## Response:\n"}

The authors investigated the efficacy of lurasidone, a novel antipsychotic agent, as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate for the treatment of bipolar I depression. METHOD Patients were randomly assigned to receive 6 weeks of double-blind adjunctive treatment with lurasidone (N=183) or placebo (N=165), added to therapeutic levels of either lithium or valproate. Primary and key secondary endpoints were change from baseline to week 6 on the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and depression severity score on the Clinical Global Impressions scale for use in bipolar illness (CGI-BP), respectively. RESULTS Lurasidone treatment significantly reduced mean MADRS total score at week 6 compared with the placebo group (-17.1 versus -13.5; effect size=0.34). Similarly, lurasidone treatment resulted in significantly greater endpoint reduction in CGI-BP depression severity scores compared with placebo (-1.96 versus -1.51; effect size=0.36) as well as significantly greater improvement in anxiety symptoms and in patient-reported measures of quality of life and functional impairment. Discontinuation rates due to adverse events were 6.0% and 7.9% in the lurasidone and placebo groups, respectively. Adverse events most frequently reported for lurasidone were nausea, somnolence, tremor, akathisia, and insomnia. Minimal changes in weight, lipids, and measures of glycemic control were observed during treatment with lurasidone. CONCLUSIONS In patients with bipolar I depression, treatment with lurasidone adjunctive to lithium or valproate significantly improved depressive symptoms and was generally well tolerated.\n## Response:\n"}

ALN/D5600 produced greater bone mineral density (BMD) increases, greater bone turnover marker decreases, and less vitamin D insufficiency. This study provided detailed clinical information regarding ALN/D5600 treatment versus calcitriol 0.25\u00a0\u03bcg/day. The study did not evaluate fracture risk.\nINTRODUCTION: The aim of this study is to investigate efficacy of alendronate 70\u00a0mg/vitamin D3 5600\u00a0IU combination tablets (ALN/D5600) versus calcitriol in osteoporotic Chinese postmenopausal women.\nMETHODS: This study is a 6-month, randomized, open-label, active-comparator study with 6-month extension (clinicaltrials.gov number NCT01350934) in postmenopausal women aged >55\u00a0years with osteoporosis (low bone mineral density (BMD) with/without prior fragility fracture). Patients were randomized to ALN/D5600 once weekly or calcitriol 0.25\u00a0\u03bcg daily. The primary efficacy end point of the base study was percent change from baseline in lumbar spine BMD (month 6). Hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria were safety events of special interest.\nRESULTS: A total of 219 patients (ALN/D5600 n\u2009=\u2009111, calcitriol n\u2009=\u2009108) were randomized. Baseline characteristics were similar, 30.3\u00a0% baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) \u226415\u00a0ng/mL. At months 6 and 12, changes in lumbar spine BMD from baseline were 3.5 versus 1.6\u00a0% and 5.2 versus 2.3\u00a0% for ALN/D5600 versus calcitriol (between-group differences p\u2009<\u20090.001), respectively. Between-group differences for ALN/D5600 versus calcitriol were significant (p\u2009<\u20090.001) at months 6 and 12 for change from baseline in procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (-59.1 versus -16.8\u00a0%, -68.1 versus -17.0\u00a0%) and serum C-telopeptides (-79.2 versus -27.2\u00a0%, -76.2 versus -24.2\u00a0%). Drug-related adverse events (AEs) and discontinuations due to drug-related AEs occurred in 15 (14.0\u00a0%) versus 8 (7.4\u00a0%) patients and 3 (2.8\u00a0%) versus 0 patients in the ALN/D5600 and calcitriol group, respectively. Hypercalciuria 12-month incidence (24-h urine Ca >300\u00a0mg) was 8.4 (ALN/D5600) versus 13.9\u00a0% (calcitriol) (p\u2009>\u20090.05). One patient (calcitriol) had hypercalcemia.\nCONCLUSIONS: ALN/D5600 produced greater increases in lumbar spine BMD and greater decreases in bone turnover markers versus calcitriol in osteoporotic Chinese women. It is not known whether the greater increase in BMD results in fewer fractures. ALN/D5600 was generally well tolerated in Chinese patients.\n## Response:\n"}

Participants (18-65 y) had DSM-IV-TR-diagnosed MDD and lead-in baseline Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total scores \u226524. Eight-week antidepressant lead-in phases prospectively assessed antidepressant response. Then, 8 weeks of randomized (1:1), double-blind treatment with dose-optimized LDX (20-70mg) or placebo in participants exhibiting inadequate antidepressant monotherapy responses (augmentation baseline MADRS total scores \u226518 and <50% MADRS total score reductions from lead-in baseline to augmentation baseline) was initiated. The primary endpoint was MADRS total score change from augmentation baseline to week 16. Safety and tolerability measures included the occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs).\nRESULTS: Least squares mean (95% CI) treatment differences (LDX-placebo) for MADRS total score changes from augmentation baseline to week 16 were not statistically significant in study 1 (0.1 [-1.7, 2.0], P=0.883) or study 2 (-0.5 [-2.3, 1.3], P=0.583). The only TEAE reported by >5% of LDX participants at twice the placebo rate in both studies was dry mouth.\nLIMITATIONS: Limitations include the exclusion of participants with psychiatric comorbidities/active medical disorders, the inability to assess specific MDD symptom domains (eg, anhedonia, cognition) or subtypes, the use of telephone-based depression assessments, and the potential influence of placebo response.\nCONCLUSION: Contrary to expectations, LDX augmentation was not superior to placebo in reducing depressive symptoms in individuals with MDD exhibiting inadequate responses to antidepressant monotherapy.\n## Response:\n"}

The primary outcome is completion of CRC screening during the study period.\nRESULTS: The analytic cohort consisted of 91 patients due for CRC screening who had a test ordered at the visit. Six of the 9 IDM elements occurred in < or =20% of the visits with none addressed in > or =50%. CRC screening occurred less frequently for those discussing \"pros and cons\" (12% vs. 46%, P = 0.01) and \"patient preferences\" (6% vs. 47%, P = 0.001) compared with those who did not.\nCONCLUSIONS: We found that a lack of informed decision-making occurred during CRC screening discussions and that particular elements of the process were negatively associated with screening.

The study purpose was to examine if disease and treatment cognitive perceptions influence short-term CPAP use.\nMETHODS: A prospective longitudinal study included 66, middle-aged (56.7 \u00b1 10.7 yr) subjects (34 [51.5%] Caucasians; 30 [45.4%] African Americans) with severe OSA (AHI 43.5 events/hr \u00b1 24.6). Following full-night diagnostic/CPAP polysomnograms, home CPAP use was objectively measured at 1 week and 1 month. The Self Efficacy Measure for Sleep Apnea (SEMSA) questionnaire, measuring risk perception, outcome expectancies, and self-efficacy, was collected at baseline, post-CPAP education, and after 1 week CPAP treatment. Regression models were used.\nRESULTS: CPAP use at one week was 3.99 \u00b1 2.48 h/night and 3.06 \u00b1 2.43 h/night at one month. No baseline SEMSA domains influenced CPAP use. Post-education self-efficacy influenced one week CPAP use (1.52 \u00b1 0.53, p=0.007). Self-efficacy measured post-education and after one week CPAP use also influenced one month CPAP (1.40 \u00b1 0.52, p=0.009; 1.20 \u00b1 0.50, p=0.02, respectively).\nCONCLUSION: Cognitive perceptions influence CPAP use, but only within the context of knowledge of CPAP treatment and treatment use.\nPRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Patient education is important to OSA patients' formulation of accurate and realistic disease and treatment perceptions which influence CPAP adherence.\n## Response:\n"}

Alpha-1 adrenoreceptors mediate as much as 50% of anal resting pressure in humans. We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled study of the effects of alfuzosin, an alpha1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, on anal pressures alone in healthy women and also on bowel symptoms in women with DD.\nMETHODS: In a double-blind study performed from March 2013 through March 2017, anal pressures were evaluated before and after 36 women with DD (constipation for at least 1 year) and 36 healthy women (controls) were randomly assigned (1:1) to groups given oral alfuzosin (2.5 mg immediate release) or placebo. Thereafter, patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to groups given oral alfuzosin (10 mg extended release) or placebo each day for 2 weeks. Participants kept daily diaries of bowel symptoms for 2 weeks before (baseline) and during administration of the test articles (treatment). Weekly questionnaires recorded the overall severity of constipation symptoms, bloating, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting; overall satisfaction with treatment of constipation was evaluated at weeks 2 and 4. The primary endpoint was the change in the number of spontaneous (SBMs) and complete SBMs (CSBMs) between the treatment and baseline periods. We evaluated relationships between stool form, passage, and complete evacuation.\nRESULTS: Alfuzosin reduced anal resting pressure by 32 \u00b1 3 mm Hg versus 16 \u00b1 3 mm Hg for placebo (P\u00a0=\u00a0.0001) and anal pressure during evacuation by 26 \u00b1 3 mm Hg versus 16 \u00b1 3 mm Hg for placebo, (P\u00a0= .03). However, alfuzosin did not significantly increase the rectoanal gradient, SBMs or CSBMs compared with placebo. Both formulations of alfuzosin were well tolerated. Hard stools and the ease of passage during defecation accounted for 72% and 76% of the variance in the satisfaction after defecation, respectively, during baseline and treatment periods.\nCONCLUSIONS: In a randomized trial, alfuzosin reduced anal pressure at rest and during simulated evacuation in healthy and constipated women, compared with placebo, but did not improve bowel symptoms in constipated women. This could be because the drug does not improve stool form or dyssynergia, which also contribute to DD. ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT\u00a001834729.\n## Response:\n"}

We aimed to examine associations of quantitative gastrointestinal and psychological traits with obesity, and to validate the ability of these traits to predict responses of obese individuals to pharmacotherapy.\nMETHODS: In a prospective study, we measured gastric emptying of solids and liquids, fasting and postprandial gastric volume, satiation by nutrient drink test (volume to fullness and maximal tolerated volume), satiety after an ad libitum buffet meal, gastrointestinal hormones, and psychological traits in 328 normal-weight, overweight, or obese adults. We also analyzed data from 181 previously studied adults to assess associations betwecen a subset of traits with body mass index and waist circumference. Latent dimensions associated with overweight or obesity were appraised by principal component analyses. We performed a proof of concept, placebo-controlled trial of extended-release phentermine and topiramate in 24 patients to validate associations between quantitative traits and response to weight-loss therapy.\nRESULTS: In the prospective study, obesity was associated with fasting gastric volume (P\u00a0= .03), accelerated gastric emptying (P < .001 for solids and P\u00a0= .011 for liquids), lower postprandial levels of peptide tyrosine tyrosine (P\u00a0=\u00a0.003), and higher postprandial levels of glucagon-like peptide 1 (P < .001). In a combined analysis of data from all studies, obesity was associated with higher volume to fullness (n\u00a0= 509; P\u00a0= .038) and satiety with abnormal waist circumference (n\u00a0= 271; P\u00a0= .016). Principal component analysis identified latent dimensions that accounted for approximately 81% of the variation among overweight and obese subjects, including satiety or satiation (21%), gastric motility (14%), psychological factors (13%), and gastric sensorimotor factors (11%). The combination of phentermine and topiramate caused significant weight loss, slowed gastric emptying, and decreased calorie intake; weight loss in response to phentermine and topiramate was significantly associated with calorie intake at the prior satiety test.\nCONCLUSIONS: Quantitative traits are associated with high body mass index; they can distinguish obesity phenotypes and, in a proof of concept clinical trial, predicted response to pharmacotherapy for obesity.

Measures of active and passive suicidal ideation were constructed from the Beck Suicide Scale and Beck Depression Inventory obtained at baseline and 3-months follow-up. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of passive and active suicidal ideation while adjusting for demographic characteristics and somatic-affective symptoms of depression (e.g., anhedonia, insomnia).\nRESULTS: Burdensomeness and hopelessness were significantly associated with passive suicidal ideation at baseline and 3 months follow-up, but belongingness and the interaction between belongingness and burdensomeness were not significant predictors as proposed by the interpersonal theory of suicide. Somatic-affective depressive symptoms, but not any of the main effects predicted by the interpersonal theory of suicide or their interactions, were associated with active suicidal ideation at baseline. No factors were consistently associated with active suicidal ideation at 3 months follow-up.\nLIMITATIONS: The measure of burdensomeness used in this study only partially represents the construct described by the interpersonal theory of suicide.\nCONCLUSION: We found little support for the predictions of the interpersonal theory of suicide. Hopelessness appears to be an important determinant of passive suicidal ideation, while somatic-affective depression symptoms may be a key contributor to active suicidal ideation.\n## Response:\n"}

The appearance of adverse medical events (AMEs) was carefully monitored and recorded throughout the trial.\nRESULTS: Both the BII and the Qol question improved gradually over time (60 and 54. 6%, respectively, after 12 months of treatment). At any visits, the improvements were statistically significant versus the baseline (p<0. 01). Alfuzosin was able to improve the BPH symptoms progressively and significantly over time: total mean score I-PSS: 3rd month = 22. 7%, 6th month = 38.4%, 9th month 0.50%, 12th month = 61.6%. The improvement was more marked in patients with severe symptoms at baseline (I-PSS score 20-35, 63.6%). A progressive and marked improvement over time of the problems due to symptoms (SPI) was observed in the whole population (61.7% after 12 months of treatment). After 12 months of treatment, uroflowmetric data showed a significant increase in peak (+5.5 ml/s) flow rate, associated with a marked decrease in residual volume: -31 ml (-53.5%). Twenty-five patients (7.1%) experienced one or more AMEs (total AMEs n = 44). Globally, 14 vasodilatory events and 30 non-vasodilatory events were reported. Fifteen (4.3%) patients dropped out prematurely from the study for safety reasons. Seven serious AMEs were reported during the study period.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study showed that long-term treatment with alfuzosin in usual clinical practice had a continued and positive impact on the patients' QoL.\n## Response:\n"}

We report efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of qHPV vaccine in a Phase 3 study in Japanese men.\nMETHODS: In this randomized, double-blind trial (NCT01862874), Japanese men (aged 16-26\u202fyears) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive three doses of qHPV vaccine or placebo (Day 1, Month 2, Month 6). The primary efficacy endpoint was the combined incidence of HPV6/11/16/18-related persistent anogenital infection (detected at \u22652 consecutive visits \u22656\u202fmonths apart), assessed in the per-protocol population of men who received all three vaccinations, and were seronegative at Day 1 and PCR negative from Day 1 to Month 7 to the relevant HPV type. Results are from the interim and final analyses.\nRESULTS: In total, 1124 participants were randomized. The vaccine demonstrated 83.3% (95% confidence interval: 24.9, 98.2; p\u202f=\u202f0.007) and 85.9% (95% confidence interval: 52.7, 97.3; p\u202f<\u202f0.001) efficacy against HPV6/11/16/18-related persistent infection in the interim and final analyses, respectively. Two cases of HPV6/11/16/18-related external genital lesions (condyloma and PIN 1) were observed in the placebo group and none in the qHPV vaccine group at study end. At Month 7, >97% of participants who received qHPV vaccine seroconverted to each of the vaccine HPV types. Most participants remained seropositive at Month 36, although the seropositivity rate declined between Months 7 and 36. Vaccination-related adverse events were reported in 60.8% and 56.5% of participants in the qHPV vaccine and placebo groups, respectively; most commonly mild to moderate injection-site pain, erythema, and swelling. Injection-site pain and swelling were more common with qHPV vaccine than placebo (each p\u202f<\u202f0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: Results suggest qHPV vaccine is efficacious against HPV6/11/16/18-related persistent infections, immunogenic, and well-tolerated in Japanese men.

Laboratory tests included hematocrit (Hct), prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time (PTT), platelet count, fibrinogen concentration, and thromboelastography. Stepwise linear regression analysis indicated that platelet count during CPB was the variable most significantly associated with intraoperative blood loss (in milliliters per kilogram) and 12-hour chest tube output (in milliliters per kilogram). Other independent variables associated with blood loss were thromboelastography maximum amplitude (MA) during CPB, preoperative PTT, preoperative Hct, and preoperative thromboelastography angle and shear modulus values. Thromboelastography MA during CPB was the only variable associated with total products transfused (in milliliters per kilogram). Of all tests studied, platelet count during CPB (< or = 108,000/microL) provided the maximum sensitivity (83%) and specificity (58%) for prediction of excessive blood loss (receiver operating characteristic analysis). Blood loss was inversely related to patient age; neonates received the most donor units (median, 8 units; range, 6 to 10 units).\nCONCLUSIONS: During cardiac surgery, coagulation tests (including thromboelastography) drawn pre-CPB and during CPB are useful to identify children at risk for excessive bleeding.

In this study, the efficacy of amiodarone for prevention of post-pulmonary resection AF was investigated.\nMETHODS: One hundred thirty patients undergoing lobectomy, bilobectomy, or pneumonectomy were randomly assigned prospectively to receive amiodarone (n = 65) or no prophylaxis (control group, n = 65). The amiodarone group received 1,050 mg by continuous intravenous infusion over 24 hours, initiated at the time of anesthesia induction, followed by 400 mg orally twice daily until hospital discharge or for a maximum of 6 days. The primary endpoint was AF requiring treatment during hospitalization. Secondary endpoints included postoperative length of hospital and intensive care unit stays.\nRESULTS: There were no significant differences between the amiodarone and control groups in demographics, comorbid conditions, extent of pulmonary resection, or preoperative or postoperative use of beta-blockers or calcium-channel blockers. The incidence of AF was lower in the amiodarone group than in the control group (13.8% versus 32.3%, p = 0.02; relative risk reduction = 57%). There was no difference between the amiodarone and control groups in median length of hospital stay (7 versus 8 days, p = 0.79), but median length of intensive care unit stay was shorter in the amiodarone group (46 versus 84 hours, p = 0.03). There was no significant difference between the amiodarone and control groups in the incidence of pulmonary complications or other adverse effects.\nCONCLUSIONS: Amiodarone prophylaxis significantly reduces the incidence of AF after anatomic pulmonary resection, and is associated with a significant reduction in length of intensive care unit stay.\n## Response:\n"}

Off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery is thought to avoid this deleterious effect of pump use on platelets. However, the influence of off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery on platelets has not been thoroughly studied.\nMETHODS: Accordingly, we evaluated 60 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting prospectively using cardiopulmonary bypass and warm cardioplegic arrest (n = 30) or an off-pump technique (n = 30). Platelet function was evaluated before and 2 hours after coronary artery bypass grafting.\nRESULTS: Among patients undergoing on-pump coronary artery bypass surgery, all studies of platelet function were significantly abnormal after surgical intervention compared with results before surgical intervention. Similarly, among patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery, evidence of platelet dysfunction after surgical intervention was noted, with a lower platelet count and a higher proportion of P-selectin- and Annexin V-positive platelets. However, compared with the preprocedural value, the postprocedural decrease in platelet count (78,200 x 10(3)/microL vs 103,000 x 10(3)/microL) and platelet aggregation (0.8% vs 10.9%) and increase in bleeding time (0 minutes vs +1.3 minutes), P-selectin-positive platelets (6.0% vs 9.1%), and Annexin V-positive platelets (1.7% vs 3.7%) were significantly lower in the off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery group compared with those in the on-pump coronary artery bypass surgery group, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: Early postoperative decrease in platelet count and increase in platelet activation occurs to a much lesser extent and does not alter bleeding time or adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery. This lack of significant effects on platelets might in part account for the potential decreased risk in bleeding and for the preserved hemostasis seen in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery compared with those undergoing on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting surgery.\n## Response:\n"}

The main outcome measures were lipopolysaccharide-stimulated production of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), and scores on the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF), the vitality scale from the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form (SF-36), and the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale.\nRESULTS: Immediately post-treatment, fatigue was not lower (P > .05) but vitality was higher (P = .01) in the yoga group compared with the control group. At 3 months post-treatment, fatigue was lower in the yoga group (P = .002), vitality was higher (P = .01), and IL-6 (P = .027), TNF-\u03b1 (P = .027), and IL-1\u03b2 (P = .037) were lower for yoga participants compared with the control group. Groups did not differ on depression at either time (P > .2). Planned secondary analyses showed that the frequency of yoga practice had stronger associations with fatigue at both post-treatment visits (P = .019; P < .001), as well as vitality (P = .016; P = .0045), but not depression (P > .05) than simple group assignment; more frequent practice produced larger changes. At 3 months post-treatment, increasing yoga practice also led to a decrease in IL-6 (P = .01) and IL-1\u03b2 (P = .03) production but not in TNF-\u03b1 production (P > .05).\nCONCLUSION: Chronic inflammation may fuel declines in physical function leading to frailty and disability. If yoga dampens or limits both fatigue and inflammation, then regular practice could have substantial health benefits.\n## Response:\n"}

Although individuals with mild to moderate impairments benefit from conventional cardiovascular exercise interventions, there is a lack of effective approaches for persons with severely impaired physical function. This randomized controlled pilot trial investigated efficacy and feasibility of feedback-controlled robotics-assisted treadmill exercise (FC-RATE) for cardiovascular rehabilitation in persons with severe impairments early after stroke.\nMETHODS: Twenty individuals (age 61 \u00b1 11 years; 52 \u00b1 31 days poststroke) with severe motor limitations (Functional Ambulation Classification 0-2) were recruited for FC-RATE or conventional robotics-assisted treadmill exercise (RATE) (4 weeks, 3 \u00d7 30-minute sessions/wk). Outcome measures focused on peak cardiopulmonary performance parameters, training intensity, and feasibility, with examiners blinded to allocation.\nRESULTS: All 14 allocated participants (70% of recruited) completed the intervention (7/group, withdrawals unrelated to intervention), without serious adverse events occurring. Cardiovascular fitness increased significantly in both groups, with peak oxygen uptake increasing from 14.6 to 17.7 mL \u00b7 kg \u00b7 min (+17.8%) after 4 weeks (45.8%-55.7% of predicted maximal aerobic capacity; time effect P = 0.01; no group-time interaction). Training intensity (% heart rate reserve) was significantly higher for FC-RATE (40% \u00b1 3%) than for conventional RATE (14% \u00b1 2%) (P = 0.001).\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Substantive overall increases in the main cardiopulmonary performance parameters were observed, but there were no significant between-group differences when comparing FC-RATE and conventional RATE. Feedback-controlled robotics-assisted treadmill exercise significantly increased exercise intensity, but recommended intensity levels for cardiovascular training were not consistently achieved. Future research should focus on appropriate algorithms within advanced robotic systems to promote optimal cardiovascular stress.Video abstract available for more insights from the authors (Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A107).\n## Response:\n"}

Measurement of intrathoracic impedance with an implanted device with an audible patient alert may detect increases in pulmonary fluid retention early. We hypothesized that early intervention could prevent hospitalizations and affect outcome.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 335 patients with chronic heart failure who had undergone implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator alone (18%) or with cardiac resynchronization therapy (82%). All devices featured a monitoring tool to track changes in intrathoracic impedance (OptiVol) and other diagnostic parameters. Patients were randomized to have information available to physicians and patients as an audible alert in case of preset threshold crossings (access arm) or not (control arm). The primary end point was a composite of all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalizations. During 14.9\u00b15.4 months, this occurred in 48 patients (29%) in the access arm and in 33 patients (20%) in the control arm (P=0.063; hazard ratio, 1.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.97-2.37). This was due mainly to more heart failure hospitalizations (hazard ratio, 1.79; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-2.95; P=0.022), whereas the number of deaths was comparable (19 versus 15; P=0.54). The number of outpatient visits was higher in the access arm (250 versus 84; P<0.0001), with relatively more signs of heart failure among control patients during outpatient visits. Although the trial was terminated as a result of slow enrollment, a post hoc futility analysis indicated that a positive result would have been unlikely.\nCONCLUSION: Use of an implantable diagnostic tool to measure intrathoracic impedance with an audible patient alert did not improve outcome and increased heart failure hospitalizations and outpatient visits in heart failure patients.

Comparisons are needed to help physicians and patients select among the options for treatment.\nMETHODS: we compared efficacy and adverse events of new treatments from controlled clinical trials of patients with uncontrolled partial seizures. Response rates (> or =50% decrease in partial seizures) at doses recommended in product labeling for adjunct therapy were tabulated for overall success (placebo response rate subtracted from AED response rate). Adverse events listed in product labeling were tabulated as complaint rates (placebo events subtracted from AED events). VNS trials used low dose stimulation as a pseudo-placebo.\nRESULTS: overall success rates fell into two general groups with ranges of 12-20% for gabapentin (GBP), lamotrigine (LTG), tiagabine (TGB), zonisamide and 27-29% for levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, and topiramate (TPM). Summary Complaint Scores also fell into two general groups with ranges of -27 to -82 for GBP, levetiracetam, TGB, zonisamide and -113 to -205 for LTG, oxcarbazepine and TPM. VNS scores were in the lower or higher success and summary complaint categories depending on whether scores from the pseudo-placebo group were subtracted from the high dose group.\nCONCLUSIONS: these data allow comparisons among AEDs and VNS using similar data from standard types of clinical trials.\n## Response:\n"}

The primary outcome was the change from baseline to cycle 6 for all indices.\nRESULTS: All parameters were similar at baseline between the two groups. Over six cycles, NOMAC/E2 had less effect on most haemostatic indices than LNG/EE. Lipids were essentially unchanged with NOMAC/E2, whereas with LNG/EE high-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides slightly increased. NOMAC/E2 induced negligible changes in glucose and insulin parameters, in contrast to LNG/EE. A much smaller increase in CRP was observed with NOMAC/E2 than with LNG/EE. NOMAC/E2 was associated with a greater increase in SHBG.\nCONCLUSIONS: The monophasic COC NOMAC/E2 had less influence on haemostasis, lipids and carbohydrate metabolism than the COC LNG/EE.\n## Response:\n"}

Change in Mini-BESTest score from baseline at 1 week post intervention.\nAbstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In order for people with Parkinson disease (PwPD) to benefit from neurorehabilitation research, interventions tested in research settings require assessment in real-world clinical practice. There is little evidence for whether efficacious exercise interventions for PwPD remain effective when transferred to standard clinical settings. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical effectiveness of the adapted HiBalance program on balance control and gait among PwPD.\nMETHODS: Participants (n = 117) with mild-moderate Parkinson disease were consecutively included into either the 10-week HiBalance group training (n = 61) or the control (n = 56) group. The main outcome was balance performance (Mini-BESTest). Secondary outcomes were comfortable gait speed (10-m Walk Test); functional mobility (Timed Up and Go [TUG] test) and dual-task interference (cognitive TUG test); physical activity level (steps per day); perceived balance confidence (Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale) and perceived walking difficulty (Walk-12G) and self-rated health (EQ-5D visual analog scale).\nRESULTS: In total, 98 people completed the trial. Compared with controls, the training group showed significant improvement in balance performance (P < 0.001), gait speed (P = 0.001), and dual-task interference (P = 0.04) following the intervention. No group differences were observed for physical activity level or any patient-reported measures.\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Highly challenging balance training is effective at improving balance, gait, and dual-task performance when delivered at a clinically feasible dose, in a range of rehabilitation settings, without direct involvement of the research group.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see the Video, Supplementary Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A299).\n## Response:\n"}

Because this is in contrast to our practice to use whole blood for only the priming of the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit and then to use blood components for additional transfusion requirements, it was our interest to analyze the bleeding complications and the use of blood products after heart operations in infants. The patient records of the 73 infants operated on in 1992 were reviewed. The chest tube drainage varied from 3 to 51 ml/kg per 6 hours (mean 10 ml/kg) and it did not correlate with any of the tested clinical or laboratory parameters. One infant underwent reoperation because of surgical bleeding. Disseminated intravascular coagulation developed in another patient. Sixty-eight patients (93%) needed red blood cell supplementation. Sixty-eight percent of patients between 1 month and 1 year old could be treated without any other postoperative transfusion except for red blood cell supplementation. In contrast, in the neonates, platelet concentrates or fresh frozen plasma, or both, were used in 61% of the patients. In addition to the known immaturity of the hemostatic system, the increased need for platelet concentrates in the neonates was attributed to longer cardiopulmonary bypass time, deeper hypothermia in association with circulatory arrest, larger dosages of heparin, and more extensive plasma dilution during cardiopulmonary bypass. In conclusion, a low rate of bleeding complications and acceptably low general blood loss can be achieved postoperatively with blood component therapy.\n## Response:\n"}

Linear mixed models indicated that sleep/wake diary sleep efficiency and total sleep time improved significantly at posttreatment in both groups and remained stable at 12-wk follow-up. More CBTI-Phone than IPC patients showed posttreatment improvements in unhelpful sleep-related cognitions (P < 0.001) and were classified as \"in remission\" from insomnia at follow-up (P < 0.05). Posttreatment effect sizes on most daytime symptoms were large (Cohen d = 0.8-2.5) for CBTI-Phone patients and small to moderate (Cohen d = -0.1-0.6) for IPC patients. All CBTI-Phone patients completed posttreatment and 12-wk follow-up assessments, but three IPC patients discontinued the study.\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings provide preliminary support for telephone-delivered CBTI in the treatment of chronic insomnia. Future larger-scale studies with more diverse samples are warranted. Some individuals with insomnia may also benefit from pamphlet-delivered CBTI with brief telephone support.\nCITATION: Arnedt JT; Cuddihy L; Swanson LM; Pickett S; Aikens J; Chervin RD.

However, even with optimal skin preparation, true sterilisation of the skin is not possible. A recently available method of preventing infection is a cyanoacrylate-based microbial sealant (marketed as InteguSeal(*) Microbial Sealant), which mechanically blocks migration of pathogens to the surgical wound. In in-vitro studies, this preoperative preparation reduced the recovery of pathogens commonly implicated in SSIs by up to 99.9%. Similarly, the incidence of wound contamination was lower with the microbial sealant than with antimicrobial surgical drapes in in-vivo studies. Other studies have shown that this microbial sealant significantly improves the effect of povidone iodine by fixing it on the skin and avoiding wash off, and does not affect normal skin transpiration. In a clinical study in 177 patients, the incidence of wound contamination was 53.0% with the sealant, compared with 68.7% using povidone iodine. The conclusion of this clinical study is that InteguSeal(*) Microbial Sealant significantly reduces surgical wound bacterial contamination when used in conjunction with 10% povidone iodine skin preparation, as compared to povidone iodine alone. The clinical experience to date is that this sealant is easy to apply and can be used with a variety of skin preparation solutions and with most wound closure techniques. It also has a good safety profile. This preparation may therefore form a valuable part of strategies to reduce bacterial contamination of surgical incisions, thereby potentially decreasing the risk of SSIs.\n## Response:\n"}

Cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug in the world, and patients seeking treatment for primary cannabis dependence represent 25% of all substance use admissions. We conducted a phase IIa proof-of-concept pilot study to examine the safety and efficacy of a calcium channel/GABA modulating drug, gabapentin, for the treatment of cannabis dependence. A 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted in 50 unpaid treatment-seeking male and female outpatients, aged 18-65 years, diagnosed with current cannabis dependence. Subjects received either gabapentin (1200\u2009mg/day) or matched placebo. Manual-guided, abstinence-oriented individual counseling was provided weekly to all participants. Cannabis use was measured by weekly urine toxicology and by self-report using the Timeline Followback Interview. Cannabis withdrawal symptoms were assessed using the Marijuana Withdrawal Checklist. Executive function was measured using subtests from the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System. Relative to placebo, gabapentin significantly reduced cannabis use as measured both by urine toxicology (p=0.001) and by the Timeline Followback Interview (p=0.004), and significantly decreased withdrawal symptoms as measured by the Marijuana Withdrawal Checklist (p<0.001). Gabapentin was also associated with significantly greater improvement in overall performance on tests of executive function (p=0.029). This POC pilot study provides preliminary support for the safety and efficacy of gabapentin for treatment of cannabis dependence that merits further study, and provides an alternative conceptual framework for treatment of addiction aimed at restoring homeostasis in brain stress systems that are dysregulated in drug dependence and withdrawal.\n## Response:\n"}

It has also revealed the limitations of environmental remediation and guidelines-based therapy in achieving greater disease control.\nMETHODS: We enrolled inner-city children, adolescents, and young adults with persistent asthma in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial at multiple centers to assess the effectiveness of omalizumab, as compared with placebo, when added to guidelines-based therapy. The trial was conducted for 60 weeks, and the primary outcome was symptoms of asthma.\nRESULTS: Among 419 participants who underwent randomization (at which point 73% had moderate or severe disease), omalizumab as compared with placebo significantly reduced the number of days with asthma symptoms, from 1.96 to 1.48 days per 2-week interval, a 24.5% decrease (P<0.001). Similarly, omalizumab significantly reduced the proportion of participants who had one or more exacerbations from 48.8 to 30.3% (P<0.001). Improvements occurred with omalizumab despite reductions in the use of inhaled glucocorticoids and long-acting beta-agonists.\nCONCLUSIONS: When added to a regimen of guidelines-based therapy for inner-city children, adolescents, and young adults, omalizumab further improved asthma control, nearly eliminated seasonal peaks in exacerbations, and reduced the need for other medications to control asthma.

One type of community-based participatory research is \"Patient Centered-Research\", in which patient perspectives on the germane research questions and methodologies are incorporated into the study. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) has mandated that meaningful patient and stakeholder engagement be incorporated into all applications. As of March 2015, PCORI funded seven clinically-focused studies of patients with kidney disease. The goal of this paper is to synthesize the experiences of these studies to gain an understanding of how meaningful patient and stakeholder engagement can occur in clinical research of kidney diseases, and what the key barriers are to its implementation. Our collective experience suggests that successful implementation of a patient- and stakeholder-engaged research paradigm involves: (1) defining the roles and process for the incorporation of input; (2) identifying the particular patients and other stakeholders; (3) engaging patients and other stakeholders so they appreciate the value of their own participation and have personal investment in the research process; and (4) overcoming barriers and challenges that arise and threaten the productivity of the collaboration. It is our hope that the experiences of these studies will further interest and capacity for incorporating patient and stakeholder perspectives in research of kidney diseases.\n## Response:\n"}

There are no controlled studies evaluating these interventions as adjuncts to facilitate completion of painful procedures in the pediatric emergency department (ED).\nOBJECTIVE: We assessed the effectiveness of distraction techniques in reducing the sensory and affective components of pain among pediatric patients undergoing laceration repair in the ED.\nMETHODS: Eligible children between 6 and 18 years of age (N = 240) presenting to the ED for laceration repair were randomly assigned to an intervention or control arm. Those assigned to the intervention arm were given a choice of age-appropriate distracters during laceration repair. Quantitative measures of pain intensity, situational anxiety, and pain distress (as perceived by the parent) were assessed by using the 7-point Facial Pain Scale, State Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children, and a visual analog scale, respectively, before and after laceration repair. The State Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children was performed in children > or = 10 years of age.\nRESULTS: There was no difference in mean change in Facial Pain Scale scores between the control and the intervention groups in children < 10 years of age. Multivariate analysis in this same age group showed that the intervention was independently associated with a reduction in pain distress as perceived by parents based on the mean change in visual analog scale scores. In older children, the intervention was independently associated with reduction in situational anxiety but not in pain intensity or in parental perception of pain distress.\nCONCLUSIONS: The use of distraction techniques is effective in reducing situational anxiety in older children and lowering parental perception of pain distress in younger children. This technique may have a role in improving the quality of management of procedural pain in a pediatric ED setting.\n## Response:\n"}

Skin physiology parameters cutaneous elasticity, surface roughness, hydration, and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) were measured in vivo at weeks 0 (before treatment), 4 (before subsequent treatment), 12, and 24. Clinical hand assessment was carried out at weeks 0 and 12 by a blinded dermatologist.\nRESULTS: Intradermal injection of S-HA generated significant improvement in skin elasticity and surface roughness at week 12 compared to baseline. On the hands treated with NS-HA, there was a trend for improvement (not significant). While there was no significant difference in hydration and TEWL between both hands before treatment, at week 12 hands treated with S-HA displayed a significantly higher hydration level and lower TEWL compared to NS-HA treatment. Clinically S-HA proved to be significantly superior to NS-HA. At week 24 the observed effects started to return back toward baseline, with S-HA treatment still offering better results compared to the NS-HA.\nCONCLUSIONS: Skin revitalization with injectable HA can improve clinical appearance and skin physiology parameters on the back of the hands. It has been shown that S-HA has better effects when compared with NS-HA.\n## Response:\n"}

Goal Management Training (GMT), which is a metacognitive intervention, offers an executive function rehabilitation approach that draws upon theories concerning goal processing and sustained attention. GMT has received empirical support in studies of patients with TBI but has not been tested in Veterans with blast-related mild TBI. GMT was modified from 7 weekly to 10 biweekly sessions. Participants included six combat Veterans that reported multiple blast exposures resulting in symptoms consistent with mild TBI. Group analysis showed a significant improvement in measures of executive function derived from performance on the computerized Tower of London. There were no significant changes on self/informant questionnaires of executive function, indicating a lack of generalization of improvement from the clinic to everyday activities. Overall, while the data indicate efficacy of GMT in the rehabilitation of combat Veterans with executive function deficits because of blast-related mild TBI, enhancement of generalization is needed.\n## Response:\n"}

We aimed to compare the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of insulin glargine and sitagliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor, in patients whose disease was uncontrolled with metformin.\nMETHODS: In this comparative, parallel, randomised, open-label trial, metformin-treated people aged 35-70 years with glycated haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) of 7-11%, diagnosis of type 2 diabetes for at least 6 months, and body-mass index of 25-45 kg/m(2) were recruited from 17 countries. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to 24-week treatment with insulin glargine (titrated from an initial subcutaneous dose of 0\u00b72 units per kg bodyweight to attain fasting plasma glucose of 4\u00b70-5\u00b75 mmol/L) or sitagliptin (oral dose of 100 mg daily). Randomisation (via a central interactive voice response system) was by random sequence generation and was stratified by centre. Patients and investigators were not masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was change in HbA(1c) from baseline to study end. Efficacy analysis included all randomly assigned participants who had received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one on-treatment assessment of any primary or secondary efficacy variable. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00751114.\nFINDINGS: 732 people were screened and 515 were randomly assigned to insulin glargine (n=250) or sitagliptin (n=265). At study end, adjusted mean reduction in HbA(1c) was greater for patients on insulin glargine (n=227; -1\u00b772%, SE 0\u00b706) than for those on sitagliptin (n=253; -1\u00b713%, SE 0\u00b706) with a mean difference of -0\u00b759% (95% CI -0\u00b777 to -0\u00b742, p<0\u00b70001). The estimated rate of all symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes was greater with insulin glargine than with sitagliptin (4\u00b721 [SE 0\u00b754] vs 0\u00b750 [SE 0\u00b709] events per patient-year; p<0\u00b70001). Severe hypoglycaemia occurred in only three (1%) patients on insulin glargine and one (<1%) on sitagliptin. 15 (6%) of patients on insulin glargine versus eight (3%) on sitagliptin had at least one serious treatment-emergent adverse event.\nINTERPRETATION: Our results support the option of addition of basal insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by metformin. Long-term benefits might be expected from the achievement of optimum glycaemic control early in the course of the disease.\nFUNDING: Sanofi.\n## Response:\n"}

Icatibant is a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist that may be beneficial in patients with ACE-I-induced angioedema.\nOBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of icatibant in subjects with ACE-I-induced angioedema.\nMETHODS: At 31 centers in 4 countries, adults on ACE-Is who presented within 12 hours of the onset of at least moderately severe angioedema were randomized 1:1 to icatibant 30 mg or placebo administered subcutaneously. The primary efficacy end point was time to meeting discharge criteria after study drug administration, based on the severity of airway symptoms assessed hourly by a blinded physician using clinical ratings across 4 domains.\nRESULTS: A total of 121 subjects were randomized (icatibant, n\u00a0= 61; placebo, n\u00a0= 60); 118 received treatment a median of\u00a07.8 hours from symptom onset. We observed no difference in\u00a0time to meeting discharge criteria between groups (median, 4.0 hours in each group; P\u00a0= .63). There also was no difference in time to onset of symptom relief (median, icatibant, 2.0 hours; placebo, 1.6 hours; P\u00a0= .57) or any other secondary end point. Similar findings were noted in prespecified and post hoc subgroup analyses stratified by symptom severity, time interval to treatment, age, and other clinical covariates. No new safety signals were detected.\nCONCLUSIONS: Icatibant was no more efficacious than placebo in at least moderately severe ACE-I-induced angioedema of the upper airway.\n## Response:\n"}

This may be related to differences in ways nurses define and approach fever.\nMETHOD: The collective case study approach was used to guide the process of data collection and analysis. Data were collected during 2006-7. Transcripts were coded using the constant comparative method until themes were identified. Cross-case comparison was conducted. The nursing process was used as an analytical filter for refinement and presentation of the findings.\nFINDINGS: Nurses across settings defined fever as a (single) elevated temperature that exceeded some established protocol. Regardless of practice setting, interventions chosen by nurses were frequently based on trial and error or individual conventions -'what works'- rather than evidence-based practice. Some nurses' accounts indicated use of interventions that were clearly contraindicated by the literature. Participants working on dedicated neuroscience units articulated specific differences in patient care more than those working on mixed units.\nCONCLUSIONS: By defining a set temperature for intervention, protocols may serve as a barrier to critical clinical judgment. We recommend that protocols be developed in an interdisciplinary manner to foster local adaptation of best practices. This could further best practice by encouraging individual nurses to think of protocols not as a recipe, but rather as a guide when individualizing patient care. There is value of specialty knowledge in narrowing the translational gap, offering institutions evidence for planning and structuring the organization of care.\n## Response:\n"}

A preferential decline in naive CD4+ T cells was noted as disease progressed. Following protease inhibitor therapy, naive CD4+ T cells increased only if they were present before initiation of therapy. Disruptions of the CD4+ TCR repertoire were most prevalent in patients with the lowest CD4+ T-cell counts. Antiviral or IL-12 therapy-induced increases in CD4+ T-cell counts led to only minor changes in previously disrupted repertoires. Thus, CD4+ T-cell death mediated by HIV-1 infection may result in a preferential decline in the number of naive CD4+ T cells and disruptions of the CD4+ T-cell repertoire that are not immediately corrected by antiviral or immune-based therapies.\n## Response:\n"}

Thus, we assessed the serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) among healthy Saudi Arabian men living in the Eastern Province.\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS: One hundred males aged 25-35 years (the age range of peak bone mass) and 100 males aged 50 years or older were randomly selected and evaluated clinically, including measurement of serum calcium, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and serum 25OHD levels. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as a serum level of 25OHD of </=20 ng/mL and insufficiency as a serum level between >20 ng/mL and <30 ng/mL and normal >or=30 ng/mL.\nRESULTS: The mean (SD) age of subjects in the younger age group was 28.2 (4.5) years. Twenty-eight (28%) had low 25OHD levels; 10 (10%) subjects were vitamin D deficient with a mean level of 16.6 (3.4) ng/mL and 18 (18%) were vitamin D insufficient with a mean level of 25.4 (2.7) ng/mL. In the older age group, the mean age was 59.4 (15.6) years and 37 (37%) had low 25OHD; 12 (12%) subjects were deficient with a mean 25OHD level of 16.7 (3.4) ng/mL and 25 (25%) were insufficient with a mean 25OHD level of 25.3 (3.3) ng/mL.\nCONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among healthy Saudi men is between 28% to 37%. Vitamin D deficiency among young and middle age Saudi Arabian males could lead to serious health consequences if the issue is not urgently addressed.\n## Response:\n"}

We developed a patient-family agenda setting intervention to engage family in cancer care communication.\nMETHODS: We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial (NCT03283553) of patients on active treatment for breast cancer and their family \"care partner.\" Intervention dyads (n\u2009=\u200969) completed a self-administered checklist to clarify care partner roles, establish a shared visit agenda, and facilitate MyChart patient portal access. Control dyads (n\u2009=\u200963) received usual care. We assessed intervention acceptability and initial effects from post-visit surveys and MyChart utilization at 6\u00a0weeks.\nRESULTS: At baseline, most patients (89.4%) but few care partners (1.5%) were registered for MyChart. Most patients (79.4%) wanted their care partner to have access to their records and 39.4% of care partners reported accessing MyChart. In completing the checklist, patients and care partners endorsed active communication roles for the care partner and identified a similar visit agenda: most (>\u200990%) reported the checklist was easy, useful, and recommended it to others. At 6\u00a0weeks, intervention (vs control) care partners were more likely to be registered for MyChart (75.4% vs 1.6%; p\u2009<\u20090.001), to have logged in (43.5% vs 0%; p\u2009<\u20090.001) and viewed clinical notes (30.4% vs 0%; p\u2009<\u20090.001), but were no more likely to exchange direct messages with clinicians (1.5% vs 0%; p\u2009=\u20090.175). No differences in patients' MyChart use were observed, but intervention patients more often viewed clinical notes (50.7% vs 9.5%; p\u2009<\u20090.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: A patient-family agenda setting intervention was acceptable and affected online practices of cancer patients and care partners.\n## Response:\n"}

The aim of this observational study was to evaluate PCT kinetics during the first 5 following days after surgery to establish the prognostic value of PCT changes in the outcome of OLTx, and to predict medical, technical and infectious complications. PCT was also evaluated in the differential diagnosis of infection vs. rejection.\nMETHODS: A total of 64 OLTx were performed in 58 patients; they were split into two groups: with and without complications. Out of these patients, 18 developed infection, and nine rejection. PCT was measured before and during surgery, 12 h after transplantation and daily for the 5 following days. PCT was also measured the day when infection or rejection was diagnosed, and on the previous day. PCT was determined by time-resolved amplified cryptate emission (TRACE) technology.\nRESULTS: PCT elevation began at 12 h after surgery, reaching a peak on the 1st day in both groups. Significantly higher PCT concentrations were found in the group of patients developing complications, on the 5 postoperative days. It was found that a 24 h PCT value higher than 1.92 microg/L increased by 9.1-time-fold the risk of complications. When infection was diagnosed, a second peak of PCT was observed, but no PCT elevation was shown in rejection.\nCONCLUSIONS: Daily monitored PCT provides valuable information about the early outcome of OLTx.\n## Response:\n"}

The efficacy of intensive treatment of hyperglycemia in this setting remains unknown.\nOBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy of intensive treatment of hyperglycemia during acute ischemic stroke.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Stroke Hyperglycemia Insulin Network Effort (SHINE) randomized clinical trial included adult patients with hyperglycemia (glucose concentration of >110 mg/dL if had diabetes or \u2265150 mg/dL if did not have diabetes) and acute ischemic stroke who were enrolled within 12 hours from stroke onset at 63 US sites between April 2012 and August 2018; follow-up ended in November 2018. The trial included 1151 patients who met eligibility criteria.\nINTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to receive continuous intravenous insulin using a computerized decision support tool (target blood glucose concentration of 80-130 mg/dL [4.4-7.2 mmol/L]; intensive treatment group: n\u2009=\u2009581) or insulin on a sliding scale that was administered subcutaneously (target blood glucose concentration of 80-179 mg/dL [4.4-9.9 mmol/L]; standard treatment group: n\u2009=\u2009570) for up to 72 hours.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of patients with a favorable outcome based on the 90-day modified Rankin Scale score (a global stroke disability scale ranging from 0 [no symptoms or completely recovered] to 6 [death]) that was adjusted for baseline stroke severity.\nRESULTS: Among 1151 patients who were randomized (mean age, 66 years [SD, 13.1 years]; 529 [46%] women, 920 [80%] with diabetes), 1118 (97%) completed the trial. Enrollment was stopped for futility based on prespecified interim analysis criteria. During treatment, the mean blood glucose level was 118 mg/dL (6.6 mmol/L) in the intensive treatment group and 179 mg/dL (9.9 mmol/L) in the standard treatment group. A favorable outcome occurred in 119 of 581 patients (20.5%) in the intensive treatment group and in 123 of 570 patients (21.6%) in the standard treatment group (adjusted relative risk, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.08], P\u2009=\u2009.55; unadjusted risk difference, -0.83% [95% CI, -5.72% to 4.06%]).

Severe hypoglycemia occurred only among patients in the intensive treatment group (15/581 [2.6%]; risk difference, 2.58% [95% CI, 1.29% to 3.87%]).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with acute ischemic stroke and hyperglycemia, treatment with intensive vs standard glucose control for up to 72 hours did not result in a significant difference in favorable functional outcome at 90 days. These findings do not support using intensive glucose control in this setting.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01369069.\n## Response:\n"}

Pursuant to promising appearing pilot data, the current study evaluated the use of vitamin E for the prevention of CIPN.\nMETHODS: A phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted in patients undergoing therapy with neurotoxic chemotherapy, utilizing twice daily dosing of vitamin E (400 mg)/placebo. The primary endpoint was the incidence of grade 2+ sensory neuropathy (SN) toxicity (CTCAE v 3.0) in each treatment arm, analyzed by chi-square testing. Planned sample size was 100 patients per arm to provide 80% power to detect a difference in incidence of grade 2+ SN toxicity from 25% in the placebo group to 10% in the vitamin E group.\nRESULTS: Two-hundred seven patients were enrolled between December 1, 2006 and December 14, 2007, producing 189 evaluable cases for analysis. Cytotoxic agents included taxanes (109), cisplatin (8), carboplatin (2), oxaliplatin (50), or combination (20). There was no difference in the incidence of grade 2+ SN between the two arms (34%-vitamin E, 29%-placebo; P\u2009=\u20090.43). There were no significant differences between treatment arms for time to onset of neuropathy (P\u2009=\u20090.58), for chemotherapy dose reductions due to neuropathy (P\u2009=\u20090.21), or for secondary endpoints derived from patient-reported neuropathy symptom assessments. The treatment was well tolerated overall.\nCONCLUSIONS: Vitamin E did not appear to reduce the incidence of sensory neuropathy in the studied group of patients receiving neurotoxic chemotherapy.\n## Response:\n"}

Pylori Was Eradicated at the 6th week after the end of anti- H. pylori therapy\nAbstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Most clinical trials concerning sequential therapy have been conducted in Italy. The efficacy of sequential therapy for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication in Asia remains unclear. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of sequential therapy with standard triple therapy in Taiwan.\nMETHODS: From January 2005 to December 2009, 233 H. pylori-infected patients receiving either a 10-day sequential therapy (40 mg pantoprazole and 1 g amoxicillin, twice daily, for the initial 5 days, followed by 40 mg pantoprazole, 500 mg clarithromycin, and 500 mg metronidazole, twice daily, for the subsequent 5 days, n = 118) or a 7-day standard triple therapy (40 mg pantoprazole, 500 mg clarithromycin, and 1 g amoxicillin twice daily for 7 days, n = 115) were included in the retrospective study. All the patients underwent a follow-up endoscopy with a rapid urease test and histological examination or a urea breath test at 8 weeks after the end of anti-H. pylori therapy to assess H. pylori status.\nRESULT: Intention-to-treat analysis demonstrated a significantly higher eradication rate for the sequential group than for the triple group (93% vs 80%, respectively, P = 0.003). Per-protocol analysis also showed similar results (93% vs 80%, P = 0.005). Both groups had similar frequencies of adverse events (29% vs 22%) and drug compliance (98% vs 97%).\nCONCLUSION: Sequential therapy achieves a higher eradication rate than standard triple therapy in Taiwan. The novel treatment can be used as a first-line therapy for H. pylori infection for Taiwanese.\n## Response:\n"}

We sought to demonstrate noninferiority of sutureless versus standard bioprostheses in severe symptomatic aortic stenosis.\nMETHODS: The Perceval Sutureless Implant Versus Standard-Aortic Valve Replacement is a prospective, randomized, adaptive, open-label trial. Patients were randomized (March 2016 to September 2018) to aortic valve replacement with a sutureless or stented valve using conventional or minimally invasive approach. Primary outcome was freedom from major adverse cerebral and cardiovascular events (composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or valve reintervention) at 1\u00a0year.\nRESULTS: At 47 centers (12 countries), 910 patients were randomized to sutureless (n\u00a0=\u00a0453) or conventional stented (n\u00a0=\u00a0457) valves; mean ages were 75.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.6 and 75.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.1\u00a0years, and 50.1% and 44.9% were female, respectively. Mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation Society of Thoracic Surgeons scores were 2.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.7 and 2.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3, and a ministernotomy approach was used in 50.4% and 47.3%, respectively. Concomitant procedures were performed with similar rates in both groups. Noninferiority was demonstrated for major adverse cerebral and cardiovascular events at 1\u00a0year, whereas aortic valve hemodynamics improved equally in both groups. Use of sutureless valves significantly reduced surgical times (mean extracorporeal circulation times: 71.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a034.1\u00a0minutes vs 87.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a033.9\u00a0minutes; mean crossclamp times: 48.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a024.7 vs 65.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a023.6; both P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001), but resulted in a higher rate of pacemaker implantation (11.1% vs 3.6% at 1\u00a0year). Incidences of perivalvular and central leak were similar.\nCONCLUSIONS: Sutureless valves were noninferior to stented valves with respect to major adverse cerebral and cardiovascular events at 1\u00a0year in patients undergoing aortic valve replacement (alone or with coronary artery bypass grafting). This suggests that sutureless valves should be considered as part of a comprehensive valve program.\n## Response:\n"}

Pharmacological strategies that produce rapid antidepressant effects-for instance, within a few hours or days-would have an enormous impact on patient care and public health.\nOBJECTIVE: To determine whether an N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor antagonist produces rapid antidepressant effects in subjects with bipolar depression.\nDESIGN: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover, add-on study conducted from October 2006 to June 2009.\nSETTING: Mood Disorders Research Unit at the National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Maryland. Patients Eighteen subjects with DSM-IV bipolar depression (treatment-resistant).\nINTERVENTIONS: Subjects maintained at therapeutic levels of lithium or valproate received an intravenous infusion of either ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo on 2 test days 2 weeks apart. The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale was used to rate subjects at baseline and at 40, 80, 110, and 230 minutes and on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 10, and 14 postinfusion.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale primary efficacy measure scores.\nRESULTS: Within 40 minutes, depressive symptoms significantly improved in subjects receiving ketamine compared with placebo (d = 0.52, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.28-0.76); this improvement remained significant through day 3. The drug difference effect size was largest at day 2 (d = 0.80, 95% CI, 0.55-1.04). Seventy-one percent of subjects responded to ketamine and 6% responded to placebo at some point during the trial. One subject receiving ketamine and 1 receiving placebo developed manic symptoms. Ketamine was generally well tolerated; the most common adverse effect was dissociative symptoms, only at the 40-minute point.\nCONCLUSION: In patients with treatment-resistant bipolar depression, robust and rapid antidepressant effects resulted from a single intravenous dose of an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist.\n## Response:\n"}

The emergence and reemergence of RNA viruses continue to pose a significant public health threat worldwide with particular attention to the increasing incidence of flaviviruses, among others Dengue, West Nile Virus, and Yellow Fever viruses. Development of new and potent antivirals is thus urgently needed. Ivermectin, an already known antihelminthic drug, has shown potent effects in vitro on Flavivirus helicase, with EC50 values in the subnanomolar range for Yellow Fever and submicromolar EC50 for Dengue Fever, Japanese encephalitis, and tick-borne encephalitis viruses. However ivermectin is hampered in its application by pharmacokinetic problems (little solubility and high cytotoxicity). To overcome such problems we engineered different compositions of liposomes as ivermectin carriers characterizing and testing them on several cell lines for cytotoxicity. The engineered liposomes were less cytotoxic than ivermectin alone and they showed a significant increase of the antiviral activity in all the Dengue stains tested (1, 2, and S221). In the current study ivermectin is confirmed to be an effective potential antiviral and liposomes, as drug carriers, are shown to modulate the drug activity. All together the results represent a promising starting point for future improvement of ivermectin as antiviral and its delivery.\n## Response:\n"}

This was followed by an additional 8 weeks of open-label treatment for modafinil responders and 12 weeks for placebo nonresponders. The primary outcome measure for fatigue and depression was the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale, supplemented by the FSS, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and Beck Depression Inventory. Safety was assessed with assays of CD4 cell count and HIV ribonucleic acid (RNA) viral load. Visits were weekly for 4 weeks, then biweekly, with a follow-up visit at 6 months. Maximum trial dose of modafinil was 200 mg/d. Data for this study were collected between December 2004 and December 2008.\nRESULTS: 115 patients were randomly assigned. In intention-to-treat analyses, fatigue response rate to modafinil was 73% and to placebo, 28%. Attrition was 9%. Modafinil did not have an effect on mood alone in the absence of improved energy. At week 4, CD4 cell counts did not change significantly; HIV RNA viral load showed a trend decline for patients taking modafinil but not for those taking placebo. At 6 months, those still taking modafinil had more energy and fewer depressive symptoms than patients who were not taking modafinil, and only those still taking modafinil showed a significant decline from baseline in their HIV RNA viral load.\nCONCLUSIONS: Modafinil appears to be effective and well tolerated in treating fatigue in HIV+ patients. Consideration of its use is warranted considering the high prevalence of fatigue in the HIV community, its minimal side effects, and overall patient acceptance.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00118378.\n## Response:\n"}

In this study, we compared a reduction treatment approach with an immediate cessation approach in a population of ST users who reported no immediate plans to quit.\nMETHODS: Subjects randomly assigned to the immediate cessation condition set a quit date soon after enrollment and were offered 2 weeks of nicotine patch therapy to help in their cessation efforts. Subjects assigned to the ST reduction group were provided with their choice of either 4 mg nicotine lozenge or ST brand switching to help them reduce their ST use or levels of nicotine exposure, respectively. Quit date was 6 weeks after the onset of treatment. Follow-up was at 12 weeks and 26 weeks postenrollment and 26 weeks postquit.\nRESULTS: Both 7-day point prevalence abstinence and prolonged abstinence rates following the quit date were significantly higher in the immediate cessation group versus the reduction group at 12 and 26 weeks (all p values \u2264 .04) and for prolonged abstinence at 6 months postquit (p = .002). Significant reductions in ST use among nonquitters were observed for both groups (p < .0001) with no differences between groups.\nCONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that immediate cessation with an established quit date resulted in greater cessation success than a gradual reduction approach among ST users who do not have an immediate quit plan but are motivated to quit.\n## Response:\n"}

Time points of measurement: 4 hours after ROSC.\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: We investigated the immunoinflammatory profile of patients successfully resuscitated after cardiac arrest, representing a model of whole-body ischemia/reperfusion syndrome.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Plasma cytokine, endotoxin, and ex vivo cytokine production in whole-blood assays was assessed in 61, 35, and 11 patients, respectively. On admission, high levels of plasma interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, and soluble tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor type II could discriminate between survivors and nonsurvivors. Among nonsurvivors, the initial need for a vasopressor agent was associated with higher levels of IL-1 receptor antagonist, IL-10, and IL-6 on day 1. Plasma endotoxin was detected in 46% of the analyzed patients within the 2 first days. Endotoxin-induced TNF and IL-6 productions were dramatically impaired in these patients compared with healthy control subjects, whereas an unaltered production was observed with heat-killed Staphylococcus aureus. In contrast, IL-1 receptor antagonist productions were enhanced in these patients compared with healthy control subjects. The productions of T-cell-derived IL-10 and interferon-gamma were also impaired in these patients. Finally, using in vitro plasma exchange between healthy control subjects and patients, we demonstrated that the endotoxin-dependent hyporeactivity was an intrinsic property of patients' leukocytes and that an immunosuppressive activity was also present in their plasma.\nCONCLUSIONS: Altogether, the high levels of circulating cytokines, the presence of endotoxin in plasma, and the dysregulated production of cytokines found in these patients recall the immunological profile found in patients with sepsis.\n## Response:\n"}

Endothelial dysfunction contributes to atherogenesis.\nMETHODS: Oral glucose tolerance and brachial artery flow-mediated, endothelium-dependent vasodilation (EDV) were assessed in 38 nondiabetic subjects; offspring of two parents with T2D (FH+) or with no first-degree relative with diabetes (FH-).\nRESULTS: Although fasting glucose was higher in FH+ than FH- (5.3 +/- 0.1 mmol/l vs. 4.9 +/- 0.1 mmol/l, p < 0.03), glycemic burden assessed as 2-h or area-under-the-curve glucose after glucose load or glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and measures of insulin sensitivity or inflammation did not differ. Brachial artery flow-mediated EDV was reduced in FH+ (7.1 +/- 0.9% vs. 11.7 +/- 1.6%, p < 0.02), with no difference in nitroglycerin-induced endothelium-independent vasodilatation. In the combined cohort, only FH+ (r2 = 0.12, p < 0.02) and HbA1c (r2 = 0.14, p < 0.02) correlated with EDV. Insulin resistance, assessed by tertile of homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), was associated with impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilatation in FH- (p < 0.03, analysis of variance), but not in FH+, as even the most insulin-sensitive FH+ offspring had diminished endothelial function. In multiple regression analysis, including established cardiac risk factors, blood pressure and lipids, HbA1c, and HOMA-IR, FH remained a significant determinant of EDV (p = 0.04).\nCONCLUSIONS: Bioavailability of nitric oxide is lower in persons with a strong FH of T2D. Glycemic burden, even in the nondiabetic range, can contribute to endothelial dysfunction. Abnormalities of endothelial function may contribute to atherosclerosis before development of overt diabetes.\n## Response:\n"}

While conventional magnetic resonance imaging underestimates the extent of pathology following closed head injury, diffusion-weighted imaging has been shown to more accurately delineate the extent of cerebral damage. There have only been a few case studies of DTI in chronic head injury survivors. This study used DTI to investigate changes in anisotropy and diffusivity in survivors of head injury at least 6 months after their injury. The relationship between cognition and diffusion abnormality was also investigated. The voxel-based analysis revealed significant bilateral decreases in anisotropy, in major white matter tracts and association fibers in the temporal, frontal, parietal and occipital lobes. Statistically significant increases in diffusivity were also found in widespread areas of the cortex. A significant positive correlation was found between diffusivity and impairment of learning and memory in the left posterior cingulate, left hippocampal formation and left temporal, frontal and occipital cortex. The common pattern of abnormality despite heterogeneous injury mechanism and lesion location in the group suggests that these cellular changes reflect secondary insults. The importance of diffusion abnormalities in head injury outcome is emphasized by the significant correlation between a learning and memory index and diffusivity in areas known to subserve this cognitive function.\n## Response:\n"}

Over the last 18 years, since the publication of the original FIQ, several deficiencies have become apparent and the cumbersome scoring algorithm has been a barrier to widespread clinical use. The aim of this paper is to describe and validate a revised version of the FIQ: the FIQR.\nMETHODS: The FIQR was developed in response to known deficiencies of the FIQ with the help of a patient focus group. The FIQR has the same 3 domains as the FIQ (that is, function, overall impact and symptoms). It differs from the FIQ in having modified function questions and the inclusion of questions on memory, tenderness, balance and environmental sensitivity. All questions are graded on a 0-10 numeric scale. The FIQR was administered online and the results were compared to the same patient's online responses to the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and the original FIQ.\nRESULTS: The FIQR was completed online by 202 FM patients, 51 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients (31 RA and 20 SLE), 11 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 213 healthy controls (HC). The mean total FIQR score was 56.6 +/- 19.9 compared to a total FIQ score of 60.6 +/- 17.8 (P < 0.03). The total scores of the FIQR and FIQ were closely correlated (r = 0.88, P < 0.001). Each of the 3 domains of the FIQR correlated well with the 3 related FIQ domains (r = 0.69 to 0.88, P < 0.01). The FIQR showed good correlation with comparable domains in the SF-36, with a multiple regression analysis showing that the three FIQR domain scores predicted the 8 SF-36 subscale scores. The FIQR had good discriminant ability between FM and the 3 other groups; total FIQR scores were HC (12.1 +/- 11.6), RA/SLE (28.6 +/- 21.2) and MDD (17.3 +/- 11.8). The patient completion time was 1.3 minutes; scoring took about 1 minute.\nCONCLUSIONS: The FIQR is an updated version of the FIQ that has good psychometric properties, can be completed in less than 2 minutes and is easy to score. It has scoring characteristics comparable to the original FIQ, making it possible to compare past FIQ results with future FIQR results.\n## Response:\n"}

One hundred twelve women awaited breast biopsy; 42, hepatic chemoembolization for cancer; and 60, uterine fibroid embolization. Data were analyzed with multivariate analysis of variance and post hoc Tukey tests. Results are reported as means and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\nRESULTS: All three patient groups experienced abnormally high mean PSS, IES, and CES-D scores, but only the breast biopsy group had highly abnormal anxiety levels. Breast biopsy patients had a significantly higher mean STAI score of 48 (95% CI: 45, 50) than did women awaiting hepatic chemoembolization (mean score, 26; 95% CI: 22, 29; P < .001) and fibroid embolization (mean score, 24; 95% CI: 21, 27; P < .001). IES ratings did not differ significantly among the groups, with a mean score of 26 (95% CI: 23, 29) for breast biopsy patients, 23 (95% CI: 18, 28) for hepatic chemoembolization patients, and 23 (95% CI: 18, 27) for fibroid embolization patients. The CES-D score did not differ significantly among breast biopsy (mean score, 15; 95% CI: 13, 17), hepatic chemoembolization (mean score, 14; 95% CI: 11, 18), and fibroid embolization (mean score, 12; 95% CI: 9, 15) patients. PSS ratings of breast biopsy patients were significantly higher (mean score, 18; 95% CI: 16, 19) than those of hepatic chemoembolization patients (mean, 15; 95% CI: 13, 17; P < .01), but they were not significantly different from those of women awaiting fibroid embolization (mean, 16; 95% CI: 14, 18; P = .23).\nCONCLUSION: Uncertainty of diagnosis can be associated with greater stress than is awaiting more invasive and potentially risky treatment.\n## Response:\n"}

Little is known about parental knowledge and usage of air quality including the AQI in managing childhood asthma.\nMETHODS: Forty parents (or legal guardians) of children with persistent asthma completed a questionnaire designed to assess 4 areas related to outdoor air pollution: awareness, perception, behavioral modification, and prior healthcare provider discussion. Descriptive statistics were obtained and Fisher's exact test was used for analysis of behavioral change by selected variables.\nRESULTS: Almost all parents reported awareness of air quality alerts or AQI, however, only 20% checked the AQI on the AirNow app or website. Most parents reported air pollution as a trigger (65%), yet few parents reported behavioral modification of their child's outdoor activity based on the perception of poor air quality (43%) or based on AQI or alerts (40%). Over half of parents reported a healthcare provider had ever discussed air pollution as a trigger, with few parents (23%) reporting recommendations for behavior change. Perception of air pollution as a trigger, healthcare provider discussion and recommendations, and usage of AirNow were associated with increased reported activity change.\nCONCLUSION: Healthcare providers should discuss outdoor air pollution during asthma management in children and should discuss AirNow as a source for AQI information and behavioral recommendations.\n## Response:\n"}

The primary outcome was the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) global score. Other outcomes included the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI). Assessments were made before and immediately, 3 months, and 6 months after the treatment period. Within-group changes were analyzed with paired t tests or repeated measures analysis of variance. Analysis of covariance was used for between-group comparisons.\nRESULTS: Forty-six children (24 HBO, 22 HBA) were analyzed at the second interim analysis, which was scheduled to take place when at least half of the required number of patients in each group had completed pre- and post-treatment testing. No changes occurred in the GMFM from pre- to post-treatment in either group or between groups. Statistically significant increases occurred in both groups on the PEDI, with no difference between groups. The study was stopped because the calculated conditional probability of obtaining a difference between groups if the study continued to the end was only between 0.5% and 1.6%.\nINTERPRETATION: HBO was not effective in improving GMFM scores, and was no more effective than HBA in improving PEDI scores. These results do not support use of HBO as a therapy for cerebral palsy in young children who did not have neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.\n## Response:\n"}

Previous collaborative care trials targeting PTSD after injury have been effective, but they have required intensive clinical resources. The present pragmatic clinical trial randomized acutely injured trauma survivors who screened positive on an automated electronic medical record PTSD assessment to collaborative care intervention (n = 60) and usual care control (n = 61) conditions. The stepped measurement-based intervention included care management, psychopharmacology, and psychotherapy elements. Embedded within the intervention were a series of information technology (IT) components. PTSD symptoms were assessed with the PTSD Checklist at baseline prerandomization and again, 1-, 3-, and 6-months postinjury. IT utilization was also assessed. The technology-assisted intervention required a median of 2.25 hours (interquartile range = 1.57 hours) per patient. The intervention was associated with modest symptom reductions, but beyond the margin of statistical significance in the unadjusted model: F(2, 204) = 2.95, p = .055. The covariate adjusted regression was significant: F(2, 204) = 3.06, p = .049. The PTSD intervention effect was greatest at the 3-month (Cohen's effect size d = 0.35, F(1, 204) = 4.11, p = .044) and 6-month (d = 0.38, F(1, 204) = 4.10, p = .044) time points. IT-enhanced collaborative care was associated with modest PTSD symptom reductions and reduced delivery times; the intervention model could potentially facilitate efficient PTSD treatment after injury.\n## Response:\n"}

In this trial, 401 patients (mean age 59\u00b78 years [SD 9\u00b73]; HbA1c 7\u00b79% [63 mmol/mol]; mean diabetes duration 12\u00b76 years [SD 8\u00b70]) were block randomised (ratio 1:1) to receive either stepwise treatment or full basal-bolus treatment. Patients in the basal-bolus group received insulin aspart before every meal throughout the trial. Patients in the stepwise group received one bolus dose with the largest meal, with additional insulin aspart doses before the next largest meal added to their regimen at 11 weeks and 22 weeks if HbA1c remained at 7% or higher. The primary outcome was non-inferiority of stepwise addition of bolus insulin versus complete basal-bolus therapy, as assessed by change in HbA1c from baseline to 32 weeks (non-inferiority margin of 0\u00b74%). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01165684.\nFINDINGS: The study was started on Oct 27, 2010, and completed on April 25, 2012. After 32 weeks, HbA1c change from baseline was -0\u00b798% (95% CI -1\u00b709 to -0\u00b787) for the stepwise group and -1\u00b712% (-1\u00b723 to -1\u00b700) for the basal-bolus group; mean treatment difference 0\u00b714 (95% CI -0\u00b702 to 0\u00b730), non-significant (p=0\u00b70876). Fewer hypoglycaemic episodes occurred in the stepwise group than in the basal-bolus group (rate ratio 0\u00b758 [95% CI 0\u00b745 to 0\u00b775]; p<0\u00b70001). Treatment-emergent adverse events did not differ between the two treatment groups. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse event were nasopharyngitis, influenza, diarrhoea, headache, peripheral oedema, and wrong drug given. Three participants died: two before randomisation and one in the basal-bolus group (due to severe acute myocardial infarction and respiratory tract inflammation).\nINTERPRETATION: Stepwise prandial insulin intensification provides glycaemic control non-inferior to a full basal-bolus regimen after 32 weeks, with significantly lower hypoglycaemia risk and better patient satisfaction.\nFUNDING: Novo Nordisk.\n## Response:\n"}

Yearly transfusion of packed red blood cells (3,276 vs. 2,959 units; P < 0.0001) and fresh frozen plasma (1986 vs. 102 units; P < 0.0001) decreased, as did the median number of packed red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma per patient. The incidence of fibrinogen concentrate (3.73 vs. 10.01%; P < 0.0001) and prothrombin complex concentrate administration (4.42 vs. 8.9%; P < 0.0001) increased, as did their amount administered per year (179 vs. 702 g; P = 0.0008 and 162 \u00d7 10\u00b3 U vs. 388 \u00d7 10\u00b3 U; P = 0.0184, respectively). Despite a switch from aprotinin to tranexamic acid, an increase in use of dual antiplatelet therapy (2.7 vs. 13.7%; P < 0.0001), patients' age, proportion of females, emergency cases, and more complex surgery, the incidence of massive transfusion [(\u226510 units packed red blood cells), (2.5 vs. 1.26%; P = 0.0057)] and unplanned reexploration (4.19 vs. 2.24%; P = 0.0007) decreased.

During the first day of HCLC, median of the participant's mean glucose concentrations fell rapidly to 146 mg/dL, a level of control that was sustained on Days 2 and 3 (138 mg/dL and 139 mg/dL, respectively). By Day 3, the median percentage of glucose values >250 and <60 mg/dL was <1%. During the first 2 weeks of SAP treatment at home, the median participant mean glucose level was 126 mg/dL (interquartile range, 117, 137 mg/dL), and the median percentage of values between 71 and 180 mg/dL was 85% (interquartile range, 80%, 90%).\nCONCLUSIONS: Inpatient HCLC followed by outpatient SAP therapy can provide a safe and effective means to rapidly reverse glucose toxicity and establish near-normal glycemic control in patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes.\n## Response:\n"}

For patients who fail low dose levetiracetam (LEV), a reasonable alternative to increasing dosage may be the addition of a low-dose adjunctive AED.\nMETHODS: In this open-label, pilot trial, low-dose lacosamide (200 mg/d) was added to adult patients with breakthrough seizures on low-dose monotherapy LEV (\u22641500 mg/d). Comparison was made with a retrospective historical control cohort in whom the dose of LEV was raised after a breakthrough seizure. The main objectives were to determine efficacy effect size and tolerability.\nRESULTS: Twenty patients were recruited in the prospective polytherapy cohort, of whom 19 received at least 1 dose of adjunctive AED; the monotherapy cohort consisted of 36 patients. Six-month seizure freedom was achieved in 9 of 19 patients in the polytherapy cohort and in 15 of 36 patients in the monotherapy cohort (hazard ratio for seizure occurrence for polytherapy relative to monotherapy was 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.35-1.65; P = 0.49). There were treatment emergent adverse effects in 11 patients (61.1%) in the polytherapy cohort and 26 (72.2%) in the monotherapy cohort. Greater number of patients in the monotherapy cohort experienced irritability/depression (33.3% vs 5.6%, P < 0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: Low-dose polytherapy with LEV and lacosamide was well tolerated and efficacious.

Patients received four cycles of five intra-articular HA or placebo injections with a follow-up of 6 months after the first and second cycles, and 1 year after the third and fourth cycles. Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) 2004 responder criteria were used to assess efficacy. The consumption of rescue medication was a secondary outcome. Adverse events were recorded for safety purposes.\nRESULTS: At the 40-month visit significantly more patients responded to HA compared with placebo (OARSI 2004, p=0.004). The number of responders to HA increased through the study, whereas those to placebo did not change. Significant differences were also found in favour of HA for each individual component of the OARSI 2004. No safety problems were recorded.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results of AMELIA offer pioneer evidence that repeated cycles of intra-articular injections of HA not only improve knee osteoarthritis symptoms during the in-between cycle period but also exert a marked carry-over effect for at least 1 year after the last cycle. In this respect, it is not possible to establish if this carry-over effect reflects true osteoarthritis remission or just a modification of the disease's natural course.

Social support and culturally relevant and age-appropriate physical active interventions are needed to reduce inactivity and to prevent weight gain among this group. Mobile-health text messages have shown to be an acceptable, feasible and interactive way to promote physical activity among older Black women.\nSTUDY DESIGN: This feasibility, 12-week RCT, deployed between August 2020 and December 2020, aimed to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of a mobile health intervention that focused on increasing physical activity behaviors among community-dwelling, older Black women who were age \u226560 years and classified with overweight or obesity.\nSETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling, older Black women.\nINTERVENTION: The intervention group received physical activity promotion text messages daily, whereas the control group received 1 neutral message related to general health information weekly.\nMEASURES: At baseline and post intervention assessments, researchers obtained HbA1c levels, weight, BMI, waist circumference, and questionnaires related to physical activity. Post-intervention satisfaction was also collected through a survey.\nRESULTS: The intervention group had an average increase of approximately 700 steps per day more than the control group, lost more waist circumference inches (2.2) than the controls, and averaged more pound loss (2.5) than controls. The control group had a greater HbA1c reduction, whereas the intervention group remained stable. The text messages were 100% readable, and 95% of the women stated the study was motivational. Overall, 12% of participants suggested that future studies should include more in-person social support, and 8.3% said that daily text messages were too much.\nCONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that a mobile health physical activity intervention that uses self-monitoring techniques in conjunction with motivational cues, is an acceptable delivery method and a promising strategy to increase physical activity behaviors among this population, which is feasible, potentially efficacious, and low cost.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT04114071.\n## Response:\n"}

It also lowers heart rate and blood pressure and has antiadrenergic and potential ventricular antiarrhythmic effects. We hypothesized that dronedarone would reduce major vascular events in high-risk permanent atrial fibrillation.\nMETHODS: We assigned patients who were at least 65 years of age with at least a 6-month history of permanent atrial fibrillation and risk factors for major vascular events to receive dronedarone or placebo. The first coprimary outcome was stroke, myocardial infarction, systemic embolism, or death from cardiovascular causes. The second coprimary outcome was unplanned hospitalization for a cardiovascular cause or death.\nRESULTS: After the enrollment of 3236 patients, the study was stopped for safety reasons. The first coprimary outcome occurred in 43 patients receiving dronedarone and 19 receiving placebo (hazard ratio, 2.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.34 to 3.94; P=0.002). There were 21 deaths from cardiovascular causes in the dronedarone group and 10 in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.00 to 4.49; P=0.046), including death from arrhythmia in 13 patients and 4 patients, respectively (hazard ratio, 3.26; 95% CI, 1.06 to 10.00; P=0.03). Stroke occurred in 23 patients in the dronedarone group and 10 in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.11 to 4.88; P=0.02). Hospitalization for heart failure occurred in 43 patients in the dronedarone group and 24 in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.10 to 2.99; P=0.02).\nCONCLUSIONS: Dronedarone increased rates of heart failure, stroke, and death from cardiovascular causes in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation who were at risk for major vascular events. Our data show that this drug should not be used in such patients. (Funded by Sanofi-Aventis; PALLAS ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01151137.).\n## Response:\n"}

Behavior activation is a structured behavioral treatment that aims to increase adaptive behaviors and achieve valued goals. Supportive therapy is a nondirective, psychological treatment that provides emotional support and controls for attention.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV defined depressive disorder based on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (primary outcome), Activities Inventory, National Eye Institute Vision Function Questionnaire-25 plus Supplement (NEI-VFQ), and NEI-VFQ quality of life (secondary outcomes).\nRESULTS: At 4 months, 11 BA+LVR subjects (12.6%) and 18 ST+LVR subjects (23.4%) developed a depressive disorder (relative risk [RR], 0.54; 95% CI, 0.27-1.06; P = 0.067). In planned adjusted analyses the RR was 0.51 (95% CI, 0.27-0.98; P = 0.04). A mediational analysis suggested that BA+LVR prevented depression to the extent that it enabled subjects to remain socially engaged. In addition, BA+LVR was associated with greater improvements in functional vision than ST+LVR, although there was no significant between-group difference. There was no significant change or between-group difference in quality of life.\nCONCLUSIONS: An integrated mental health and low vision intervention halved the incidence of depressive disorders relative to standard outpatient LVR in patients with AMD. As the population ages, the number of persons with AMD and the adverse effects of comorbid depression will increase. Promoting interactions between ophthalmology, optometry, rehabilitation, psychiatry, and behavioral psychology may prevent depression in this population.\n## Response:\n"}

Pylori Was Eradicated at the 6th week after the end of anti- H. pylori therapy\nAbstract: BACKGROUND/AIMS: Antibiotic resistance and poor compliance are the main causes of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication failure. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-based triple therapy is the most preferred regimen in clinical practice. However, a critical fall in the H. pylori eradication rate has been observed in the recent years. A novel 10 day-sequential therapy consists of five days of dual therapy followed by five days of triple therapy regimen has recently been described. We aimed to evaluate whether 10 day-sequential therapy eradicated H. pylori infection better than the PPI-based triple therapy in Korea.\nMETHODS: 158 patients with proven H. pylori infection were randomized to receive either 10 day-sequential therapy (20 mg of omeprazole, 1.0 g of amoxicillin, each administered twice daily for the first 5 days, followed by 20 mg of omeprazole, 500 mg of clarithromycin, 500 mg of metronidazole, each administered twice daily for the remaining 5 days) or PPI-based triple therapy (20 mg of omeprazole, 1.0 g of amoxicillin, 500 mg of clarithromycin, each administered twice daily for 1 week). Outcome of eradication therapy was assessed 8 weeks after the cessation of treatment.\nRESULTS: Eradication rates of 10 day-sequential therapy and PPI-based triple therapy were 77.9% (60/77) and 71.6% (58/81) by intention to treat analysis, respectively (p=0.361). By per protocol analysis, eradication rates of 10 day-sequential therapy and triple therapy were 85.7% (60/70) and 76.6% (58/76), respectively (p=0.150). There were no significant differences in adverse event rates and treatment compliance between two groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: The 10 day-sequential therapy regimen failed to achieve significantly higher eradication rates than PPI-based triple therapy.\n## Response:\n"}

However, many adolescents do not receive high-quality sexual health education and turn to the media for information about sex and relationships. Consumption of sexual media messages is related to early and risky sexual behaviors. Media literacy education (MLE) is a proven approach to adolescent sexual health promotion, yet there are no rigorously evaluated web-based MLE programs to promote sexual and relationship health among high school students.\nMETHODS: This study will test the efficacy, in a randomized controlled trial, of Media Aware, a web-based comprehensive sexual health promotion program for high school students that uses an MLE approach. Participants will be students in 9th and 10th grade health classes in participating schools. Randomization will take place at the school level, and data collection will take place at three time points (i.e., pretest, posttest, and 3 months follow-up). Students in the intervention classrooms will receive Media Aware between pretest and posttest, and students in the delayed-intervention classrooms will receive Media Aware after study completion (i.e., after 3 months follow-up data collection). Students in the delayed-intervention classes will receive their standard health education programming, and teachers in the delayed-intervention classes will be asked to refrain from teaching sexual health or MLE during the study timeframe. The primary outcome variables are intentions, willingness, and behaviors related to sexual health and sexual activity.\nDISCUSSION: There are currently no evidence-based comprehensive sexual health programs for high school students that are web-based and use an MLE approach. Media Aware has the potential to be an engaging, less expensive, and effective sexual and relationship health program for high school students. Media Aware is unique in two important ways: (1) the web-based format reduces many of the challenges to fidelity of implementation associated with teacher-led sexual health education; and (2) the MLE approach addresses a commonly ignored influence on adolescent sexual and relationship health, namely, media.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04035694.

Stress involves two-way communication between the brain and the cardiovascular, immune, and other systems via neural and endocrine mechanisms. Beyond the \"flight-or-fight\" response to acute stress, there are events in daily life that produce a type of chronic stress and lead over time to wear and tear on the body (\"allostatic load\"). Yet, hormones associated with stress protect the body in the short-run and promote adaptation (\"allostasis\"). The brain is a target of stress, and the hippocampus was the first brain region, besides the hypothalamus, to be recognized as a target of glucocorticoids. Stress and stress hormones produce both adaptive and maladaptive effects on this brain region throughout the life course. Early life events influence life-long patterns of emotionality and stress responsiveness and alter the rate of brain and body aging. The hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex undergo stress-induced structural remodeling, which alters behavioral and physiological responses. As an adjunct to pharmaceutical therapy, social and behavioral interventions such as regular physical activity and social support reduce the chronic stress burden and benefit brain and body health and resilience.\n## Response:\n"}

While effective pharmacological treatments exist, they are efficacious only in certain individuals, contributing to their limited use. Secondary analysis of clinical trial data suggests that a functional polymorphism (rs1799971, Asn40Asp) of the \u00b5-opioid receptor gene (OPRM1) is associated with the risk of relapse to heavy drinking following treatment with the opioid antagonist naltrexone.\nOBJECTIVE: To prospectively examine whether rs1799971 is predictive of naltrexone treatment response.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a 12-week, double-blind, randomized clinical trial of naltrexone vs placebo in individuals with alcohol dependence (intent-to-treat analysis). Participants were randomly assigned to study treatment based on the presence of 1 or 2 copies of the Asp40 allele compared with those homozygous for the Asn40 allele (2 \u00d7 2 cell design). Recruitment occurred between January 2009 and September 2013. All participants were seen in an outpatient clinical setting. A convenience sample of participants (n = 221) was recruited from 5 sites. All participants met DSM-IV criteria for alcohol dependence, with no concurrent psychotic or manic symptoms, no use of concurrent psychotropic medications, and no current dependence on illicit substances.\nINTERVENTIONS: The study drug was naltrexone (50 mg) given once daily or corresponding placebo.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary study outcome measure was relapse to heavy drinking measured using the timeline follow-back method.\nRESULTS: There was no evidence of a genotype \u00d7 treatment interaction on the primary outcome of heavy drinking (P =\u2009.32). In the Asn40 group, the observed effect of naltrexone was similar to that in previous trials (odds ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.41-1.18; P =\u2009.17), with a very small naltrexone effect in the Asp40 group (odds ratio, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.52-2.31; P =\u2009.80), contrary to the pattern expected a priori. A significant reduction in heavy drinking occurred across all groups (P =\u2009.001). Other drinking outcomes, and all secondary outcomes, demonstrated similar time effects, with no genotype \u00d7 treatment interaction.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this study do not support the hypothesis that the Asp40 allele moderates the response to naltrexone treatment. It is premature to use the Asn40Asp polymorphism as a biomarker to predict the response to naltrexone treatment of alcohol dependence.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00831272.\n## Response:\n"}

Controversy exists as to whether use of steroids after hepatoportoenterostomy improves clinical outcome.\nOBJECTIVE: To determine whether the addition of high-dose corticosteroids after hepatoportoenterostomy is superior to surgery alone in improving biliary drainage and survival with the native liver.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: The multicenter, double-blind Steroids in Biliary Atresia Randomized Trial (START) was conducted in 140 infants (mean age, 2.3 months) between September 2005 and February 2011 in the United States; follow-up ended in January 2013.\nINTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to receive intravenous methylprednisolone (4 mg/kg/d for 2 weeks) and oral prednisolone (2 mg/kg/d for 2 weeks) followed by a tapering protocol for 9 weeks (n\u2009=\u200970) or placebo (n\u2009=\u200970) initiated within 72 hours of hepatoportoenterostomy.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point (powered to detect a 25% absolute treatment difference) was the percentage of participants with a serum total bilirubin level of less than 1.5 mg/dL with his/her native liver at 6 months posthepatoportoenterostomy. Secondary outcomes included survival with native liver at 24 months of age and serious adverse events.\nRESULTS: The proportion of participants with improved bile drainage was not statistically significantly improved by steroids at 6 months posthepatoportoenterostomy (58.6% [41/70] of steroids group vs 48.6% [34/70] of placebo group; adjusted relative risk, 1.14 [95% CI, 0.83 to 1.57]; P\u2009=\u2009.43). The adjusted absolute risk difference was 8.7% (95% CI, -10.4% to 27.7%). Transplant-free survival was 58.7% in the steroids group vs 59.4% in the placebo group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.0 [95% CI, 0.6 to 1.8]; P\u2009=\u2009.99) at 24 months of age. The percentage of participants with serious adverse events was 81.4% [57/70] of the steroids group and 80.0% [56/70] of the placebo group (P\u2009>\u2009.99); however, participants receiving steroids had an earlier time of onset of their first serious adverse event by 30 days posthepatoportoenterostomy (37.2% [95% CI, 26.9% to 50.0%] of steroids group vs 19.0% [95% CI, 11.5% to 30.4%] of placebo group; P\u2009=\u2009.008).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among infants with biliary atresia who have undergone hepatoportoenterostomy, high-dose steroid therapy following surgery did not result in statistically significant treatment differences in bile drainage at 6 months, although a small clinical benefit could not be excluded. Steroid treatment was associated with earlier onset of serious adverse events in children with biliary atresia.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00294684.\n## Response:\n"}

This study was a post hoc pooled analysis of 3 randomized placebo-controlled trials of a single intra-articular injection of LMWF-5A, focusing on the subset of patients with severe osteoarthritis of the knee (Kellgren-Lawrence grade 4). Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive a single 4-mL intra-articular knee injection of either LMWF-5A or saline. Safety was assessed as the incidence and severity of adverse events. Efficacy was assessed as the change from baseline to week 12 on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain (primary outcome), stiffness, and physical function subscores and on patient global assessment scores and was presented as the least squares mean difference and 95% confidence interval. The proportion of responders was defined with the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology-Osteoarthritis Research Society International criteria for scenario D and examined with Pearson's chi-square test. For 417 patients with severe osteoarthritis of the knee, treatment with LMWF-5A resulted in a significant decrease in pain at 12 weeks compared with saline (mean difference, -0.19; 95% confidence interval, -0.34 to -0.04; P=.016), with improvements in function (mean difference, -0.15; 95% confidence interval, -0.31 to 0.01) and patient global assessment (mean difference, -0.30; 95% confidence interval, -0.49 to -0.12) and higher responder rates (64.25% vs 50.90%, P=.006). No drug-related serious adverse events and no deaths occurred, and the incidence and severity of adverse events were similar across treatment groups. This pooled analysis supports the use of LMWF-5A as a safe therapeutic agent for relief of the signs and symptoms of severe osteoarthritis of the knee.

We report the first Phase 3 placebo-controlled study of an oral antispasticity agent to use an enriched study design.\nMETHODS: \u2002 A 19-week follow-up, multicentre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in subjects with multiple sclerosis spasticity not fully relieved with current antispasticity therapy. Subjects were treated with nabiximols, as add-on therapy, in a single-blind manner for 4weeks, after which those achieving an improvement in spasticity of \u226520% progressed to a 12-week randomized, placebo-controlled phase.\nRESULTS: \u2002 Of the 572 subjects enrolled, 272 achieved a \u226520% improvement after 4weeks of single-blind treatment, and 241 were randomized. The primary end-point was the difference between treatments in the mean spasticity Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) in the randomized, controlled phase of the study. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis showed a highly significant difference in favour of nabiximols (P=0.0002). Secondary end-points of responder analysis, Spasm Frequency Score, Sleep Disturbance NRS Patient, Carer and Clinician Global Impression of Change were all significant in favour of nabiximols.\nCONCLUSIONS: \u2002 The enriched study design provides a method of determining the efficacy and safety of nabiximols in a way that more closely reflects proposed clinical practice, by limiting exposure to those patients who are likely to benefit from it. Hence, the difference between active and placebo should be a reflection of efficacy and safety in the population intended for treatment.\n## Response:\n"}

We tested the effects of cognitive rehabilitation in these patients using the Attention Process Training-II (APT-II) program in a single-blinded, randomized clinical trial.\nMETHODS: Patients were randomized to APT-II or standard care and evaluated at baseline, 6, and 12 months with functional, quality of life, cognitive tests, and resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI).\nRESULTS: Forty-six patients were enrolled and 43 (mean\u00b1SD age 75.1\u00b16.8) completed the study. No change was seen in functionality and quality of life between treated and non-treated patients. However, the Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test immediate recall showed a significant improvement in treated compared to non-treated group (change score 6 versus 12 months: 1.8\u00b14.9 and -1.4\u00b13.8, p\u200a=\u200a0.021; baseline versus 12 months: 3.8\u00b16.1 and 0.2\u00b14.4, p\u200a=\u200a0.032).

We report a post hoc subgroup analysis of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) enrolled in KEYNOTE-181 in Asia, including patients from the KEYNOTE-181 China extension study.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred and forty Asian patients with advanced/metastatic ESCC were enrolled in KEYNOTE-181, including the China cohort. Patients were randomly assigned 1 : 1 to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks for \u22642 years or investigator's choice of paclitaxel, docetaxel, or irinotecan. OS, progression-free survival, response, and safety were analyzed without formal comparisons. OS was evaluated based on PD-L1 CPS expression level.\nRESULTS: In Asian patients with ESCC, median OS was 10.0 months with pembrolizumab and 6.5 months with chemotherapy [hazard ratio (HR), 0.63; 95% CI 0.50-0.80; nominal P < 0.0001]. Median progression-free survival was 2.3 months with pembrolizumab and 3.1 months with chemotherapy (HR, 0.79; 95% CI 0.63-0.99; nominal P\u00a0= 0.020). Objective response rate was 17.1% with pembrolizumab and 7.1% with chemotherapy; median duration of response was 10.5 months and 7.7 months, respectively. In patients with PD-L1 CPS <1 tumors (pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy), the HR was 0.99 (95% CI 0.56-1.72); the HR (95% CI) for death was better for patients with PD-L1 CPS cut-offs >1 [CPS \u22651, 0.57 (0.44-0.75); CPS \u22655, 0.56 (0.41-0.76); CPS \u226510, 0.53 (0.37-0.75)]. Treatment-related adverse events were reported in 71.8% of patients in the pembrolizumab group and 89.8% in the chemotherapy group; grade 3-5 events were reported in 20.0% and 44.6%, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: Pembrolizumab monotherapy demonstrated promising efficacy in Asian patients with ESCC, with fewer treatment-related adverse events than chemotherapy. PD-L1 CPS \u22651 is an appropriate cut-off and a predictive marker of pembrolizumab efficacy in Asian patients with ESCC.\n## Response:\n"}

The estimated difference (VAC - GSUC) was 0.4% (95% confidence interval: -1.0, 1.7) for wound surface area and 1.4% (95% confidence interval: -0.7, 3.5) for volume. The mean cost per day for GSUC therapy was $4.22 versus $96.51 for VAC therapy (P < 0.01) and the average time required for a GSUC dressing change was 19 minutes versus 31 minutes for a VAC dressing change (P < 0.01). The sum of pain intensity differences was 0.50 in the GSUC group compared with 1.73 for the VAC group (P = 0.02).\nCONCLUSIONS: GSUC is noninferior to VAC with respect to changes in wound volume and surface area in an acute care setting. In addition, GSUC dressings were easier to apply, less expensive, and less painful.\n## Response:\n"}

Teduglutide (ALX-0600), a dipeptidyl peptidase IV resistant GLP-2 analogue, prolongs the intestinotrophic properties of GLP-2 in animal models. The safety and effect of teduglutide were investigated in SBS patients with and without a colon in continuity.\nMETHODS: Teduglutide was given subcutaneously for 21 days once or twice daily to 16 SBS patients in the per protocol investigational group, 10 with end jejunostomy (doses of 0.03 (n = 2), 0.10 (n = 5), or 0.15 (n = 3) mg/kg/day), one with <50% colon in continuity (dose 0.03 mg/kg/day), and five with > or = 50% colon in continuity (dose 0.10 mg/kg/day). Nutrient balance studies, D-xylose tests, and intestinal mucosa biopsies were performed at baseline, on the last three days of treatment, and after three weeks of follow up. Pre-study fasting native GLP-2 levels were determined for the five patients with > or = 50% colon in continuity.\nRESULTS: Pooled across groups and compared with baseline, teduglutide increased absolute (+743 (477) g/day; p<0.001) and relative (+22 (16)%; p<0.001) wet weight absorption, urine weight (+555 (485) g/day; p<0.001), and urine sodium excretion (+53 (40) mmol/day; p<0.001). Teduglutide decreased faecal wet weight (-711 (734) g/day; p = 0.001) and faecal energy excretion (-808 (1453) kJ/day (-193 (347) kcal/day); p = 0.040). In SBS patients with end jejunostomy, teduglutide significantly increased villus height (+38 (45)%; p = 0.030), crypt depth (+22 (18)%; p = 0.010), and mitotic index (+115 (108)%; p = 0.010). Crypt depth and mitotic index did not change in colonic biopsies from SBS patients with colon in continuity. The most common side effects were enlargement of the stoma nipple and mild lower leg oedema. The improvements in intestinal absorption and decreases in faecal excretion noted after treatment had reversed after the drug free follow up period. A controlled study with a more robust design is ongoing in order to determine the optimal dosage of teduglutide for SBS patients to achieve the maximal effect and utility of this drug in clinical practice.\nCONCLUSION: Teduglutide, at three dose levels for 21 days, was safe and well tolerated, intestinotrophic, and significantly increased intestinal wet weight absorption in SBS patients with an end jejunostomy or a colon in continuity.\n## Response:\n"}

Intervention group received culturally appropriate and tailored educational program for weight management while control group received general health information. Anthropometrics, blood pressure, levels of physical and sedentary activity, diet, self-efficacy, and quality of life were assessed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. Linear mixed-effects models and regression models were used to analyze outcomes.\nRESULTS: The study included 40 adolescent participants. Adolescents in the intervention reduced their BMI (z\u202f=\u202f-4.89, p < .001), BMI z score (z\u202f=\u202f-4.72, p < .001), sugary beverage (z\u202f=\u202f-.44, P\u202f=\u202f.001), and TV and computer time (z\u202f=\u202f-.51, p < .001) and increasing in self-efficacy in nutrition and physical activity significantly more than those in the control group. BMI reduction was significantly correlated with decreased fast food consumption and increased physical activity (F\u202f=\u202f6.99, p\u202f=\u202f.007, r2\u202f=\u202f.40).

This unexpected transition of a 2-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) examining interdisciplinary graded exposure treatment (GET Living) compared with multidisciplinary pain management for youth with chronic pain provided an opportunity to implement the first remotely delivered exposure treatment and remotely delivered biomechanical assessment for pediatric chronic pain. Here we describe these new approaches and provide lessons learned to inform future efforts in digital health care.\nMETHODS: A total of 68 youth (M=14.2\u2009y; 80.9% female) were enrolled in the RCT (n=31 in-person, n=5 hybrid, n=32 virtual, n=9 withdrew). Of those withdrawn, n=3 withdrew due to COVID-19 related reasons. Some RCT elements required slight modification (eg, e-consent, actigraphy deployment, recruitment, and screening), while others were significantly altered (eg, session format and lab-based biomechanical assessment). Data from exit interviews were also examined to assess perspectives on the virtual format transition.\nRESULTS: Results showed an increased enrollment rate when virtual care was an option (70.7%) compared with in-person (44.3%). Equivalent rates of completion for daily assessment (in-person, 72.8%; virtual, 73.3) were also observed, and participants described enhanced experience when able to complete exercises and exposures in their home environment during session (vs. a rehabilitation gym) allowing for genuine in vivo exposures (eg, household chores, riding bicycles).\nDISCUSSION: Overall, our data demonstrate acceptability, feasibility, and equivalent patient engagement to virtual treatment. Novel methods implemented in this RCT can inform trial design and measures of clinical endpoints for future digital health interventions.\n## Response:\n"}

Because a vital, functioning pulp is capable of initiating several defence mechanisms to protect the body from bacterial invasion, it is beneficial to preserve the vitality and health of an exposed pulp rather than replace it with a root filling material following pulp exposure. There is no consensus on the survival rate of formerly cariously exposed pulps. Observation time, judgement criteria, pulpotomy/pulp capping technique and, most importantly, pulpal status at the time of treatment, vary to a great extent amongst studies. In mature teeth, a pulp exposed by caries is usually removed and the root canals are cleaned, shaped and filled. Amongst the methods for preservation of a cariously exposed pulp, partial pulpotomy has yielded a markedly high success rate in young teeth. Major limitations in the success of vital pulp therapy in cariously exposed permanent teeth exist. The lack of predictability and long-term success greatly influence decision-making. The decision-making itself is unreliable primarily due to the difficulty of accurately diagnosing the ability of the pulp to repair. While there are indications for vital pulp therapy in young permanent molars, it must be remembered that ultimately, none of these procedures enjoy the long-term success of complete root canal therapy.\n## Response:\n"}

The effects of positional therapy in ischemic stroke patients with OSA have not been investigated. We tested the hypothesis that ischemic stroke patients have less severe OSA during positional therapy that promotes nonsupine positioning.\nMETHODS: We conducted a randomized, controlled, cross-over study. Sleep apnea screening studies were performed on two consecutive nights, using a portable respiratory monitoring system, on 18 subjects within the first 14days of ischemic stroke. An apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) \u2a7e5 established the diagnosis of OSA. Subjects were randomized to positional therapy that included the use of a therapeutic pillow on either the first or second night. On the control night, subjects used the hospital pillow and were positioned ad lib. Treatment effect on AHI was estimated using a repeated measures model.\nRESULTS: All ischemic stroke subjects studied had OSA. The predominantly male group had a median age of 58years, BMI of 29kg/m(2), NIH Stroke Scale score of 3, and a median AHI on the nontherapeutic night of 39 (interquartile range: 21-54). Positional therapy reduced the amount of supine positioning by 36% (95% CI: 18-55% (P<0.001)). The AHI was reduced by 19.5% (95% CI: 4.9-31.9% (P=0.011)), when using positional therapy compared to sleeping ad lib.\nCONCLUSIONS: Positional therapy to avoid supine positioning modestly reduces sleep apnea severity after ischemic stroke, and may therefore improve outcomes.\n## Response:\n"}

The extent to which decline in T is the result of the aging process per se, as opposed to chronic illness, medication use, and other age-related factors, remains controversial. The frequency with which aging leads to T levels consistent with hypogonadism has also not been defined. These issues bear on the potential use of T replacement in aging men, because aging and hypogonadism have, in common, reduced bone and lean body mass and muscle strength and increased total and abdominal fat. We measured T and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), by RIA, in stored samples from 890 men in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging. Using a mixed-effects model, we found independent effects of age and date of sampling to reduce T levels. After compensating for date effects, which investigation suggested was artifactual, we observed significant, independent, age-invariant, longitudinal effects of age on both T and free T index (free T index = T/SHBG), with an average change of -0.124 nmol/L.yr and -0.0049 nmol T/nmol SHBG.yr. T, but not free T index, also decreased with increasing body mass index. Use of beta-blocking drugs was associated with higher T and higher free T index levels. Using total T criteria, incidence of hypogonadal T levels increased to about 20% of men over 60, 30% over 70 and 50% over 80 yr of age, and even greater percentages when free T index criteria were employed. Our observations of health factor independent, age-related longitudinal decreases in T and free T, resulting in a high frequency of hypogonadal values, suggest that further investigation of T replacement in aged men, perhaps targeted to those with the lowest serum T concentrations, are justified.\n## Response:\n"}

We developed a patient-family agenda setting intervention to engage family in cancer care communication.\nMETHODS: We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial (NCT03283553) of patients on active treatment for breast cancer and their family \"care partner.\" Intervention dyads (n\u2009=\u200969) completed a self-administered checklist to clarify care partner roles, establish a shared visit agenda, and facilitate MyChart patient portal access. Control dyads (n\u2009=\u200963) received usual care. We assessed intervention acceptability and initial effects from post-visit surveys and MyChart utilization at 6\u00a0weeks.\nRESULTS: At baseline, most patients (89.4%) but few care partners (1.5%) were registered for MyChart. Most patients (79.4%) wanted their care partner to have access to their records and 39.4% of care partners reported accessing MyChart. In completing the checklist, patients and care partners endorsed active communication roles for the care partner and identified a similar visit agenda: most (>\u200990%) reported the checklist was easy, useful, and recommended it to others. At 6\u00a0weeks, intervention (vs control) care partners were more likely to be registered for MyChart (75.4% vs 1.6%; p\u2009<\u20090.001), to have logged in (43.5% vs 0%; p\u2009<\u20090.001) and viewed clinical notes (30.4% vs 0%; p\u2009<\u20090.001), but were no more likely to exchange direct messages with clinicians (1.5% vs 0%; p\u2009=\u20090.175). No differences in patients' MyChart use were observed, but intervention patients more often viewed clinical notes (50.7% vs 9.5%; p\u2009<\u20090.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: A patient-family agenda setting intervention was acceptable and affected online practices of cancer patients and care partners.\n## Response:\n"}

Although the use of porcine xenografts for the immediate postoperative management of these wounds is known, their use has not been detailed in the dermatology literature. A case series of 15 consecutive Mohs micrographic surgery patients (mean age = 74.9 years, range = 49 to 89 years) with wounds initially managed with porcine xenografts is described. Porcine xenografts were useful in a variety of clinical settings following MMS. These included: (1) wound management when tumor margins were indeterminate pending additional dermatopathology studies and (2) wound management when there are issues such as through and through nasal defects involving the mucosa, large wound depth, exposed cartilage and or bone, or patient medical comorbidities that delay or prevent plans for immediate wound reconstruction. Future controlled studies of biologic dressings are needed to determine which options are best for micrographic surgery wounds. Comparisons should also include the traditional option of second intention healing without biologic dressings.\n## Response:\n"}

The primary endpoint was at 12 weeks, and the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale for BDD (BDD-YBOCS) was the primary outcome measure. Secondary measures for BDD included the Brown Assessment of Beliefs Scale (BABS), the Appearance Anxiety Inventory (AAI) and the Body Image Quality of Life Inventory (BIQLI). The outcome measures were collected at baseline and week 12. The CBT group, unlike the AM group, had 4 further weekly sessions that were analysed for their added value. Both groups then completed measures at their 1-month follow-up. Forty-six participants with a DSM-IV diagnosis of BDD, including those with delusional BDD, were randomly allocated to either CBT or AM.\nRESULTS: At 12 weeks, CBT was found to be significantly superior to AM on the BDD-YBOCS [\u03b2 = -7.19; SE (\u03b2) = 2.61; p < 0.01; 95% CI = -12.31 to -2.07; d = 0.99] as well as the secondary outcome measures of the BABS, AAI and BIQLI. Further benefits occurred by week 16 within the CBT group. There were no differences in outcome for those with delusional BDD or depression.\nCONCLUSIONS: CBT is an effective intervention for people with BDD even with delusional beliefs or depression and is more effective than AM over 12 weeks.\n## Response:\n"}

Women with fetal malpresentation, multifetal gestation, spontaneous labor, contraindication to prostaglandins, nonreassuring fetal heart rate tracing, intrauterine growth restriction, anomalous fetus, fetal demise, or previous cesarean delivery or other significant uterine surgery were excluded. The primary outcome measure was induction-to-delivery time. Secondary outcomes were mode of delivery, tachysystole with fetal decelerations, terbutaline use, postpartum hemorrhage, chorioamnionitis, neonatal Apgar scores, and neonatal intensive care unit admission. Analysis followed the intention-to-treat principle.\nRESULTS: The mean induction-to-delivery time was shorter with the combination of the Foley bulb and vaginal misoprostol when compared with vaginal misoprostol alone (15.3\u00b16.5 compared with 18.3\u00b18.7 hours, difference -3.1 hours, 95% confidence interval [CI] -5.9 to -0.30). The combination also resulted in shorter induction to complete cervical dilation time (13.7\u00b15.9 compared with 17.1\u00b18.7 hours, difference -3.5 hours, 95% CI -6.7 to -0.4).

However, their impact on clinical practice is not well known.\nOBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of UpToDate on outcomes of care.\nDESIGN: Retrospective study.\nSETTING: National sample of US inpatient hospitals.\nPATIENTS: Fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries.\nINTERVENTION: Adoption of UpToDate in US hospitals.\nMEASUREMENT: Risk-adjusted lengths of stay, mortality rates, and quality performance.\nRESULTS: We found that patients admitted to hospitals using UpToDate had shorter lengths of stay than patients admitted to non-UpToDate hospitals overall (5.6 days vs 5.7 days; P < 0.001) and among 6 prespecified conditions (range, -0.1 to -0.3 days; P < 0.001 for each). Further, patients admitted to UpToDate hospitals had lower risk-adjusted mortality rate for 3 of the 6 conditions (range, -0.1% to -0.6% mortality reduction; P < 0.05). Finally, hospitals with UpToDate had better quality performance for every condition on the Hospital Quality Alliance metrics. In subgroup analyses, we found that it was the smaller hospitals and the non-teaching hospitals where the benefits of the UpToDate seemed most pronounced, compared to the larger, teaching institutions where the benefits of UpToDate seemed small or nonexistent.\nCONCLUSIONS: We found a very small but consistent association between use of UpToDate and reduced length of stay, lower risk-adjusted mortality rates, and better quality performance, at least in the smaller, non-teaching institutions. These findings may suggest that computerized tools such as UpToDate could be helpful in improving care.\n## Response:\n"}

We enrolled 168 substance-using women who had not yet completed an estimated 28 weeks of pregnancy. Obstetrical clinicians provided brief advice, and study nurses administered manualized MET-CBT. The primary outcome was percentage of days in the prior 28 days in which alcohol and/or drugs were used immediately before and 3 months postdelivery.\nRESULTS: There were no significant differences across groups in terms of self-reported percentage of days in which drugs or alcohol were used prior to and 3 months postdelivery. Biological measures showed similar results. There was a trend (P=.08) for lower risk of preterm birth among those who received MET-CBT.\nCONCLUSIONS: The tested interventions had similar therapeutic effects. Hence, both treatments may be suitable for pregnant substance users, depending on the population, setting and provider availability. Interventions that are intensified after delivery may decrease postpartum \"rebound\" effects in substance misuse.\n## Response:\n"}

Hydrochlorothiazide is not believed to be efficient in this setting. In a randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial, 23 patients with hypertension and stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease received long-acting furosemide (60 mg) and hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg) for 3 months and then both diuretics for 3 months. Sodium and chloride fractional excretions were measured after 3 months of each diuretic and then after their association. A trend towards an increase in the fractional excretion of sodium and chloride was observed with furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide (P=not significant). The association of the two diuretics increased the fractional excretions of sodium and chloride from 3.4\u00b11.8 to 4.9\u00b12.8 and from 3.8\u00b12.0 to 6.0\u00b13.1, respectively (P<.05). Furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide decreased mean blood pressure by the same extent. The association of the two diuretics was more efficient on blood pressure. There were no differences between furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide with respect to natriuresis and blood pressure control in patients with hypertension and chronic kidney disease.\n## Response:\n"}

Mothers were eligible if they initiated treatment after mental health screening (depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]) at a community or public health primary care center in pregnancy. At baseline, 51% had mild to severe depression symptoms, 54% had mild to severe anxiety, and 35% had PTSD. Their ages ranged from 18 to 42 years. Mothers were 66% White, 18% Black, and 16% other races. Forty-seven percent identified as Hispanic, and 33% preferred to read and speak in Spanish. The median family annual income was less than $20,000. The PFR program or receipt of a resource packet (control condition) followed the baseline assessment and randomization; we assessed outcomes when infants were age 6 and 12 months. Compared to mothers in the control condition, mothers in the PFR condition had significantly (ps < .05) higher observed sensitivity scores at both follow-up time points (d = .25, d = .26), had improved understanding of infant-toddler social-emotional needs at both time points (d = .21, d = .45), and reported less infant externalizing behavior at age 12 months (d = .28). This study is the fourth completed randomized controlled trial of the PFR program, all involving populations experiencing adversity.

Because humans cannot synthesize EFAs and can only ineffectively synthesize LCPs, EFAs need to be consumed as part of the diet. Consequently, the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) status of the developing fetus depends on that of its mother, as confirmed by the positive relation between maternal PUFA consumption and neonatal PUFA status. Pregnancy is associated with a decrease in the biochemical PUFA status, and normalization after delivery is slow. This is particularly true for docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) because, on the basis of the current habitual diet, birth spacing appeared to be insufficient for the maternal DHA status to normalize completely. Because of the decrease in PUFA status during pregnancy, the neonatal PUFA status may not be optimal. This view is supported by the lower neonatal PUFA status after multiple than after single births. The neonatal PUFA status can be increased by maternal PUFA supplementation during pregnancy. For optimum results, the supplement should contain both n-6 and n-3 PUFAs. The PUFA status of preterm neonates is significantly lower than that of term infants, which is a physiologic condition. Because the neonatal DHA status correlates positively with birth weight, birth length, and head circumference, maternal DHA supplementation during pregnancy may improve the prognosis of preterm infants. In term neonates, maternal linoleic acid consumption correlates negatively with neonatal head circumference. This suggests that the ratio of n-3 to n-6 PUFAs in the maternal diet should be increased. Consumption of trans unsaturated fatty acids appeared to be associated with lower maternal and neonatal PUFA status. Therefore, it seems prudent to minimize the consumption of trans fatty acids during pregnancy.\n## Response:\n"}

However, the mechanisms underlying this action of ketamine [a glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor antagonist] have not been identified. We observed that ketamine rapidly activated the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, leading to increased synaptic signaling proteins and increased number and function of new spine synapses in the prefrontal cortex of rats. Moreover, blockade of mTOR signaling completely blocked ketamine induction of synaptogenesis and behavioral responses in models of depression. Our results demonstrate that these effects of ketamine are opposite to the synaptic deficits that result from exposure to stress and could contribute to the fast antidepressant actions of ketamine.\n## Response:\n"}

This study evaluated the efficacy of dexlansoprazole MR 30 mg in relieving nocturnal heartburn and GERD-related sleep disturbances, improving work productivity, and decreasing nocturnal symptom severity in patients with symptomatic GERD.\nMETHODS: Patients (N=305) with frequent, moderate-to-very severe nocturnal heartburn and associated sleep disturbances were randomized 1:1 in a double-blind fashion to receive dexlansoprazole MR or placebo once daily for 4 weeks. The primary end point was the percentage of nights without heartburn. Secondary end points were the percentage of patients with relief of nocturnal heartburn and of GERD-related sleep disturbances over the last 7 days of treatment. At baseline and week 4/final visit, patients completed questionnaires that assessed sleep quality, work productivity, and the severity and impact of nocturnal GERD symptoms.\nRESULTS: Dexlansoprazole MR 30 mg (n=152) was superior to placebo (n=153) in median percentage of nights without heartburn (73.1 vs. 35.7%, respectively; P<0.001). Dexlansoprazole MR was significantly better than placebo in percentage of patients with relief of nocturnal heartburn and GERD-related sleep disturbances (47.5 vs. 19.6%, 69.7 vs. 47.9%, respectively; P<0.001), and led to significantly greater improvements in sleep quality and work productivity and decreased nocturnal symptom severity. Adverse events were similar across treatment groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with symptomatic GERD, dexlansoprazole MR 30 mg is significantly more efficacious than placebo in providing relief from nocturnal heartburn, in reducing GERD-related sleep disturbances and the consequent impairments in work productivity, and in improving sleep quality/quality of life.\n## Response:\n"}

This study investigated whether cigarette demand predicted response to contingent monetary rewards for abstinence among individuals with substance use disorders. It also sought to replicate evidence for greater price sensitivity at whole-dollar pack price transitions (ie, left-digit effects).\nMETHODS: Participants (N = 338) were individuals in residential substance use disorder treatment who participated in a randomized controlled trial that compared contingent vouchers to noncontingent vouchers for smoking abstinence. Baseline demand indices were used to predict number of abstinent days during the 14-day voucher period (after the reduction lead-in) and at 1 and 3 months afterward.\nRESULTS: Demand indices correlated with measures of smoking and nicotine dependence. As measured by elasticity, intensity and O max, higher demand significantly predicted fewer abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings during voucher period for individuals in the noncontingent vouchers condition. Breakpoint exhibited a trend-level association with abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings. Demand indices did not predict abstinence in the contingent vouchers group, and did not predict abstinence at 1- and 3-month follow-ups. Left-digit price transitions were associated with significantly greater reductions in consumption.\nCONCLUSIONS: The association of cigarette demand with smoking behavior only in the group for whom abstinence was not incentivized indicates that CPT assesses the value of smoking more than the value of money per se and that vouchers counteract the effects of the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes. Results provide initial short-term evidence of predictive validity for the CPT indices.\nIMPLICATIONS: This study provides the first evidence of the validity of the CPT for predicting early response to brief advice for smoking cessation plus nicotine replacement in smokers with substance dependence. However, demand for cigarettes did not predict voucher-based treatment response, indicating that incentives serve as a powerful motivator not to smoke that acts in opposition to the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes and that the indices reflect the value of smoking more than the value of money per se.\n## Response:\n"}

SSI leads to higher morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. To develop strategies to reduce the risk for SSI, independent risk factors for SSI should be identified.\nMETHODS: The electronic patient record of all 3174 patients who underwent orthopedic spinal surgery at out institution were abstracted. Individual patient and perioperative characteristics were stored in an electronic database.\nRESULTS: In total, 132 (4.2%) patients were found to have an SSI with 84 having deep based infection. Estimated blood loss over 1 liter (P = 0.017), previous SSI (P = 0.012) and diabetes (P = 0.050) were found to be independent statistically significant risk factors for SSI. Obesity (P = 0.009) was found to significantly increase the risk of superficial infection, whereas anterior spinal approach decreased the risk (P = 0.010). Diabetes (P = 0.033), obesity (P = 0.047), previous SSI (P = 0.009), and longer surgeries (2-5 hours [P = 0.023] and 5 or more hours [P = 0.009]) were found to be independent significant risk factors for deep SSI.\nCONCLUSION: SSI is commonly seen after spinal surgery. In our study, we identified independent risk factors for both deep and superficial SSI. Identification of these risk factors should allow us to design protocols to decrease the risk of SSE in future patients.\n## Response:\n"}

We sought to evaluate the mental health effects of problem-solving therapy (PST), designed for caregivers of individuals with a recent diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or early dementia.\nMETHOD: Seventy-three (43 MCI and 30 early dementia) family caregivers were randomly assigned to receive PST or a comparison condition (nutritional education). Depression, anxiety, and problem-solving orientation were assessed at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post intervention.\nRESULTS: In general, the PST caregiver intervention was feasible and acceptable to family caregivers of older adults with a new cognitive diagnosis. Relative to nutritional education, PST led to significantly reduced depression symptoms, particularly among early dementia caregivers. PST also lowered caregivers' anxiety levels, and led to lessening of negative problem orientation.\nDISCUSSION: Enhanced problem-solving skills, learned early after a loved one's cognitive diagnosis (especially dementia), results in positive mental health outcomes among new family caregivers.\n## Response:\n"}

Measures of active and passive suicidal ideation were constructed from the Beck Suicide Scale and Beck Depression Inventory obtained at baseline and 3-months follow-up. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of passive and active suicidal ideation while adjusting for demographic characteristics and somatic-affective symptoms of depression (e.g., anhedonia, insomnia).\nRESULTS: Burdensomeness and hopelessness were significantly associated with passive suicidal ideation at baseline and 3 months follow-up, but belongingness and the interaction between belongingness and burdensomeness were not significant predictors as proposed by the interpersonal theory of suicide. Somatic-affective depressive symptoms, but not any of the main effects predicted by the interpersonal theory of suicide or their interactions, were associated with active suicidal ideation at baseline. No factors were consistently associated with active suicidal ideation at 3 months follow-up.\nLIMITATIONS: The measure of burdensomeness used in this study only partially represents the construct described by the interpersonal theory of suicide.\nCONCLUSION: We found little support for the predictions of the interpersonal theory of suicide. Hopelessness appears to be an important determinant of passive suicidal ideation, while somatic-affective depression symptoms may be a key contributor to active suicidal ideation.\n## Response:\n"}

Eight nonobese (aged 25 +/- 1 years, BMI 22.7 +/- 0.4 kg/m2) and eight obese (aged 27 +/- 2 years, BMI 30.6 +/- 0.9 kg/m2) men were studied under normoglycemic-hyperinsulinemic (sequential 2-h insulin infusions of 1 [step 1] and 2 [step 2] mU x kg(-1) x min(-1)) conditions, and another seven men participated in a saline control study. Central aortic pressure waves were synthesized from those recorded in the periphery using applanation tonometry and a validated reverse transfer function every 30 min. This allowed determination of augmentation (the pressure difference between early and late systolic pressure peaks) and the augmentation index (augmentation divided by pulse pressure), a measure of arterial stiffness. Whole-body glucose uptake was reduced by 48 (step 1) and 41% (step 2) (P < 0.01) in the obese subjects versus the nonobese subjects. Basal forearm blood flow averaged 2.5 +/- 0.2 and 2.6 +/- 0.2 ml x dl(-1) x min(-1) in the obese and nonobese subjects, respectively (NS). Insulin induced a significant increase in forearm blood flow after 2.5 h (3.6 +/- 0.4 ml x dl(-1) x min(-1), P < 0.05 vs. basal) in the nonobese subjects and after 4 h in the obese subjects (3.2 +/- 0.2, P < 0.05). In contrast to these slow changes in peripheral blood flow, augmentation and the augmentation index decreased significantly in the nonobese subjects after 1 h (-3.0 +/- 1.6 mmHg and -10.0 +/- 5.4%, respectively, P < 0.001 vs. basal), but remained unchanged until 3 h in the obese subjects. Percent fat (r = 0.86, P < 0.0001) and whole-body glucose uptake (r = -0.72, P < 0.01) correlated with the change in the augmentation index by insulin. These data demonstrate temporal dissociation in insulin's vascular actions. Insulin's effect to decrease arterial stiffness in nonobese subjects (a decrease in wave reflection) is observed under physiological conditions and precedes a slow vasodilatory effect in the periphery. In the obese subjects, insulin's normal effect to decrease central wave reflection is severely blunted. The degree of impairment in this novel vascular action of insulin is closely correlated with the degree of obesity and insulin action on glucose uptake.\n## Response:\n"}

After enrollment (day 0), subjects were evaluated at days 14, 42, and 84. Key objective (fluorescein and lissamine staining scores [Ora scales]) and subjective (Ocular Surface Disease Index [OSDI], 7-item visual analog scale, and ocular discomfort score [Ora scale]) measures were assessed at all visits.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary objective efficacy measure (sign) was mean change from baseline inferior corneal staining score (ICSS) at day 84. The co-primary subjective efficacy measure (symptom) was the mean change from baseline in the visual-related function subscale score of the Ocular Surface Disease Index (VR-OSDI). Supportive measures included corneal fluorescein scores (superior, central, total region) and conjunctival lissamine scores (nasal, temporal, total region) and symptom scores at day 84.\nRESULTS: The study met the primary objective efficacy ICSS end point in demonstrating superiority of lifitegrast compared with placebo (P = 0.0007). Lifitegrast significantly reduced corneal fluorescein staining (superior, P = 0.0392; total cornea, P = 0.0148) and conjunctival lissamine staining (nasal, P = 0.0039; total conjunctiva, P = 0.0086) at day 84 versus placebo. Significant (P < 0.05) improvements in nasal and total lissamine scores were observed at day 14 and maintained through day 84. The study did not meet the co-primary subjective VR-OSDI measure (P = 0.7894). However, significant improvements were observed at day 84 in ocular discomfort (P = 0.0273) and eye dryness (P = 0.0291), the most common and severe symptoms reported at baseline in both groups. There were no unanticipated or serious ocular adverse events (AEs). The most frequent reported ocular AEs were transient intermittent instillation site symptoms (irritation, discomfort) primarily on the initial lifitegrast dose at day 0.\nCONCLUSIONS: Lifitegrast ophthalmic solution 5.0% significantly reduced corneal fluorescein and conjunctival lissamine staining and improved symptoms of ocular discomfort and eye dryness compared with placebo when administered twice daily over 84 days.\n## Response:\n"}

Higher influenza vaccine dose has been associated with reduced risk of influenza illness.\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether high-dose trivalent influenza vaccine compared with standard-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine would reduce all-cause death or cardiopulmonary hospitalization in high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Pragmatic multicenter, double-blind, active comparator randomized clinical trial conducted in 5260 participants vaccinated for up to 3 influenza seasons in 157 sites in the US and Canada between September 21, 2016, and January 31, 2019. Patients with a recent acute myocardial infarction or heart failure hospitalization and at least 1 additional risk factor were eligible.\nINTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned to receive high-dose trivalent (n\u2009=\u20092630) or standard-dose quadrivalent (n\u2009=\u20092630) inactivated influenza vaccine and could be revaccinated for up to 3 seasons.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the time to the composite of all-cause death or cardiopulmonary hospitalization during each enrolling season. The final date of follow-up was July 31, 2019. Vaccine-related adverse events were also assessed.\nRESULTS: Among 5260 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 65.5 [12.6] years; 3787 [72%] men; 3289 [63%] with heart failure) over 3 influenza seasons, there were 7154 total vaccinations administered and 5226 (99.4%) participants completed the trial. In the high-dose trivalent vaccine group, there were 975 primary outcome events (883 hospitalizations for cardiovascular or pulmonary causes and 92 deaths from any cause) among 884 participants during 3577 participant-seasons (event rate, 45 per 100 patient-years), whereas in the standard-dose quadrivalent vaccine group, there were 924 primary outcome events (846 hospitalizations for cardiovascular or pulmonary causes and 78 deaths from any cause) among 837 participants during 3577 participant-seasons (event rate, 42 per 100 patient-years) (hazard ratio, 1.06 [95% CI, 0.97-1.17]; P\u2009=\u2009.21). In the high-dose vs standard-dose groups, vaccine-related adverse reactions occurred in 1449 (40.5%) vs 1229 (34.4%) participants and severe adverse reactions occurred in 55 (2.1%) vs 44 (1.7%) participants.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In patients with high-risk cardiovascular disease, high-dose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine, compared with standard-dose quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine, did not significantly reduce all-cause mortality or cardiopulmonary hospitalizations.

Pylori Was Eradicated at the 6th week after the end of anti- H. pylori therapy\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance has decreased eradication rates for Helicobacter pylori infection worldwide.\nOBJECTIVE: To determine whether sequential treatment eradicates H. pylori infection better than standard triple-drug therapy for adults with dyspepsia or peptic ulcers.\nDESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.\nSETTING: Two Italian hospitals between September 2003 and April 2006.\nPATIENTS: 300 patients with dyspepsia or peptic ulcers.\nMEASUREMENTS: (13)C-urea breath test, upper endoscopy, histologic evaluation, rapid urease test, bacterial culture, and assessment of antibiotic resistance.\nINTERVENTION: A 10-day sequential regimen (40 mg of pantoprazole, 1 g of amoxicillin, and placebo, each administered twice daily for the first 5 days, followed by 40 mg of pantoprazole, 500 mg of clarithromycin, and 500 mg of tinidazole, each administered twice daily for the remaining 5 days) or standard 10-day therapy (40 mg of pantoprazole, 500 mg of clarithromycin, and 1 g of amoxicillin, each administered twice daily).\nRESULTS: The eradication rate achieved with the sequential regimen was significantly greater than that obtained with the standard treatment in the intention-to-treat analysis (89% vs. 77%; P = 0.0134; difference, 12% [95% CI, 3% to 20%]), the modified intention-to-treat analysis (91% vs. 78%; P = 0.0022; difference, 13% [CI, 5% to 21%]), and the per-protocol analysis (93% vs. 79%; P = 0.0013; difference, 14% [CI, 6% to 21%]). Sequential therapy was significantly more effective in patients with clarithromycin-resistant strains (89% vs. 29%; P = 0.0034). The incidence of major and minor side effects did not differ between therapy groups (17% in both groups). One patient (0.7%) in the standard therapy group discontinued treatment because of side effects.\nLIMITATIONS: Follow-up was incomplete in 4.6% and 2.7% patients in the sequential therapy and standard therapy groups, respectively. The results may not be generalizable to other countries. Sequential therapy may be more effective because it includes 1 additional antibiotic (tinidazole) that is not contained in standard therapy.\nCONCLUSIONS: Sequential therapy is statistically significant compared with standard therapy for eradicating H. pylori infection and is statistically significantly more effective in patients with clarithromycin-resistant strains. Side effects are similar with both treatment regimens and are rarely severe enough to cause discontinuation of therapy. ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00403364.\n## Response:\n"}

A preliminary study suggested that sorafenib, an oral multikinase inhibitor of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and Raf may be effective in hepatocellular carcinoma.\nMETHODS: In this multicenter, phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned 602 patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who had not received previous systemic treatment to receive either sorafenib (at a dose of 400 mg twice daily) or placebo. Primary outcomes were overall survival and the time to symptomatic progression. Secondary outcomes included the time to radiologic progression and safety.\nRESULTS: At the second planned interim analysis, 321 deaths had occurred, and the study was stopped. Median overall survival was 10.7 months in the sorafenib group and 7.9 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio in the sorafenib group, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.55 to 0.87; P<0.001). There was no significant difference between the two groups in the median time to symptomatic progression (4.1 months vs. 4.9 months, respectively, P=0.77). The median time to radiologic progression was 5.5 months in the sorafenib group and 2.8 months in the placebo group (P<0.001). Seven patients in the sorafenib group (2%) and two patients in the placebo group (1%) had a partial response; no patients had a complete response. Diarrhea, weight loss, hand-foot skin reaction, and hypophosphatemia were more frequent in the sorafenib group.\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, median survival and the time to radiologic progression were nearly 3 months longer for patients treated with sorafenib than for those given placebo.

Essential features of PDC included (a) formal partnerships between Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers and Alzheimer's Association Chapters; (b) a multidimensional assessment and treatment approach, (c) ongoing monitoring and long-term relationships with families, and (d) a computerized information system to guide service delivery and fidelity monitoring.\nDESIGN AND METHODS: Data illustrating the use of the intervention were displayed for 93 veterans and their caregivers after 12 months in PDC. Descriptive data were provided for each major component of the intervention protocol, including: initial assessment, goals, action steps, and on-going monitoring. Care coordinators completed a 12-item questionnaire ascertaining the acceptability and feasibility of implementing PDC.\nRESULTS: Data from the assessments and goals indicated areas of need were not limited to any one issue or subset of issues, but were widely distributed across a variety of domains. Findings for action steps suggested a primary focus on getting/giving information and action-oriented tasks to access services and programs. Most action steps were assigned and completed by veteran's spouses and the majority were successfully accomplished. On average, families had two contacts per month with care coordinators. Few barriers were indicated by care coordinators in implementing PDC, highlighting the acceptability and feasibility of the PDC protocol.\nIMPLICATIONS: PDC addressed the diverse needs of individuals with dementia and their caregivers, including important non-medical care issues, such as understanding VA benefits, accessing community resources, and addressing caregiver strain. PDC proved to be a feasible model that was complementary to the existing programs of the 2 partnering organizations.\n## Response:\n"}

The primary end point was progression-free survival.\nRESULTS: A total of 599 patients received cetuximab plus FOLFIRI, and 599 received FOLFIRI alone. The hazard ratio for progression-free survival in the cetuximab-FOLFIRI group as compared with the FOLFIRI group was 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72 to 0.99; P=0.048). There was no significant difference in the overall survival between the two treatment groups (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.07; P=0.31). There was a significant interaction between treatment group and KRAS mutation status for tumor response (P=0.03) but not for progression-free survival (P=0.07) or overall survival (P=0.44). The hazard ratio for progression-free survival among patients with wild-type-KRAS tumors was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.50 to 0.94), in favor of the cetuximab-FOLFIRI group. The following grade 3 or 4 adverse events were more frequent with cetuximab plus FOLFIRI than with FOLFIRI alone: skin reactions (which were grade 3 only) (in 19.7% vs. 0.2% of patients, P<0.001), infusion-related reactions (in 2.5% vs. 0%, P<0.001), and diarrhea (in 15.7% vs. 10.5%, P=0.008).\nCONCLUSIONS: First-line treatment with cetuximab plus FOLFIRI, as compared with FOLFIRI alone, reduced the risk of progression of metastatic colorectal cancer. The benefit of cetuximab was limited to patients with KRAS wild-type tumors. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00154102.)\n## Response:\n"}

This study used a mixed methods design to examine participant changes in selected domains 6 months after enrollment in a Canadian field trial of Housing First.\nMETHODS: The study sample included 301 participants receiving the Housing First intervention at the Toronto site of the At Home/Chez Soi project. This study used a pre-post design to compare quantitative 6-month outcome data to baseline values in key domains and multivariate regression to identify baseline demographic, clinical or service use variables associated with observed changes in these domains. In addition, qualitative data exploring participant and service provider perspectives and experiences was collected via stakeholder interviews and focus groups, and analyzed using thematic analysis.\nRESULTS: The majority (60 to 72%) of participants followed the expected trajectory of improvement, with the remaining experiencing difficulties in community integration, mental health symptom severity, substance use, community functioning and quality of life 6 months after program enrollment. Diagnosis of psychotic disorder was associated with a reduction in quality of life from baseline to 6-months, while substance use disorders were associated with reduced mental illness symptoms and substance use related problems and an improvement in quality of life. Participants housed in independent housing at 6-months had greater improvements in community integration and quality of life, and greater reduction in mental illness symptoms, compared to those not independently housed. The quality of the working alliance was positively associated with improvements in physical and psychological community integration and quality of life. Qualitative data provided a unique window into the loneliness and isolation experienced by Housing First participants, as well as problems related to substance use and a need for life skills training and support.\nCONCLUSIONS: Additional strategies can help support Housing First participants in the early stages of program participation and address potential causes of early difficulties, including lack of life skills and social isolation.

The primary end point was the rate of RBC transfusion independence (TI) \u2265 8 weeks. Secondary end points were RBC-TI \u2265 24 weeks, duration of RBC-TI, erythroid response, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and safety.\nRESULTS: RBC-TI \u2265 8 weeks was achieved in 26.9% and 2.5% of patients in the lenalidomide and placebo groups, respectively (P < .001). Ninety percent of patients achieving RBC-TI responded within 16 weeks of treatment. Median duration of RBC-TI with lenalidomide was 30.9 weeks (95% CI, 20.7 to 59.1). Transfusion reduction of \u2265 4 units packed RBCs, on the basis of a 112-day assessment, was 21.8% in the lenalidomide group and 0% in the placebo group. Higher response rates were observed in patients with lower baseline endogenous erythropoietin \u2264 500 mU/mL (34.0% v 15.5% for > 500 mU/mL). At week 12, mean changes in HRQoL scores from baseline did not differ significantly between treatment groups, which suggests that lenalidomide did not adversely affect HRQoL. Achievement of RBC-TI \u2265 8 weeks was associated with significant improvements in HRQoL (P < .01). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.\nCONCLUSION: Lenalidomide yields sustained RBC-TI in 26.9% of RBC transfusion-dependent patients with lower-risk non-del(5q) myelodysplastic syndromes ineligible for or refractory to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. Response to lenalidomide was associated with improved HRQoL. Treatment-emergent adverse event data were consistent with the known safety profile of lenalidomide.\n## Response:\n"}

Food insecurity (FI) is emerging as an important barrier to adherence to care and treatment recommendations for people living with HIV (PLHIV), but this relationship has not been comprehensively examined. Therefore, we reviewed the literature to explore how FI may impact ART adherence, retention in medical care, and adherence to health care recommendations among PLHIV. We found data to support FI as a critical barrier to adherence to ART and to other health care recommendations among HIV-infected adults, HIV-infected pregnant women and their HIV-exposed infants, and child and adolescent populations of PLHIV. Associations between FI and ART non-adherence were seen in qualitative and quantitative studies. We identified a number of mechanisms to explain how food insecurity and ART non-adherence may be causally linked, including the exacerbation of hunger or ART side effects in the absence of adequate food and competing resource demands. Interventions that address FI may improve adherence to care and treatment recommendations for PLHIV.\n## Response:\n"}

Interleukin-1 is a key proinflammatory cytokine in FMF.\nOBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of rilonacept, an interleukin-1 decoy receptor, in treating patients with colchicine-resistant or -intolerant FMF.\nDESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, single-participant alternating treatment study. (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT00582907).\nSETTING: 6 U.S. sites.\nPATIENTS: Patients with FMF aged 4 years or older with 1 or more attacks per month.\nINTERVENTION: One of 4 treatment sequences that each included two 3-month courses of rilonacept, 2.2 mg/kg (maximum, 160 mg) by weekly subcutaneous injection, and two 3-month courses of placebo.\nMEASUREMENTS: Differences in the frequency of FMF attacks and adverse events between rilonacept and placebo.\nRESULTS: 8 males and 6 females with a mean age of 24.4 years (SD, 11.8) were randomly assigned. Among 12 participants who completed 2 or more treatment courses, the rilonacept-placebo attack risk ratio was 0.59 (SD, 0.12) (equal-tail 95% credible interval, 0.39 to 0.85). The median number of attacks per month was 0.77 (0.18 and 1.20 attacks in the first and third quartiles, respectively) with rilonacept versus 2.00 (0.90 and 2.40, respectively) with placebo (median difference, -1.74 [95% CI, -3.4 to -0.1]; P = 0.027). There were more treatment courses of rilonacept without attacks (29% vs. 0%; P = 0.004) and with a decrease in attacks of greater than 50% compared with the baseline rate during screening (75% vs. 35%; P = 0.006) than with placebo. However, the duration of attacks did not differ between placebo and rilonacept (median difference, 1.2 days [-0.5 and 2.4 days in the first and third quartiles, respectively]; P = 0.32). Injection site reactions were more frequent with rilonacept (median difference, 0 events per patient treatment month [medians of -4 and 0 in the first and third quartiles, respectively]; P = 0.047), but no differences were seen in other adverse events.\nLIMITATION: Small sample size, heterogeneity of FMF mutations, age, and participant indication (colchicine resistance or intolerance) were study limitations.\nCONCLUSION: Rilonacept reduces the frequency of FMF attacks and seems to be a treatment option for patients with colchicine-resistant or -intolerant FMF.\nPRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Office of Orphan Products Development.\n## Response:\n"}

We enrolled 168 substance-using women who had not yet completed an estimated 28 weeks of pregnancy. Obstetrical clinicians provided brief advice, and study nurses administered manualized MET-CBT. The primary outcome was percentage of days in the prior 28 days in which alcohol and/or drugs were used immediately before and 3 months postdelivery.\nRESULTS: There were no significant differences across groups in terms of self-reported percentage of days in which drugs or alcohol were used prior to and 3 months postdelivery. Biological measures showed similar results. There was a trend (P=.08) for lower risk of preterm birth among those who received MET-CBT.\nCONCLUSIONS: The tested interventions had similar therapeutic effects. Hence, both treatments may be suitable for pregnant substance users, depending on the population, setting and provider availability.

Efficacy was assessed by equivalence in mean daily seven-point blood glucose (MDBG). Safety assessments included severe hypoglycemia episodes, adverse device effects (ADEs), and adverse events (AEs). Device satisfaction was determined by the validated Insulin Delivery System Rating Questionnaire (IDSRQ) and QOL by the validated Diabetes Specific QOL Scale (DSQOLS).\nRESULTS: Using bolus-patch, MDBG (mean\u00b1SE) was equivalent to that using pen/syringe (8.61\u00b10.28 vs. 9.02\u00b10.26\u2009mmol/L; P=0.098). SD of the seven-point blood glucose measurements was lower using bolus-patch (3.18\u00b10.18 vs. 3.63\u00b10.17 mmol/L; P=0.004), as was the coefficient of variation (CV) (37.2\u00b11.7 vs. 40.3\u00b11.7%; P=0.046). Hemoglobin A1c, 1,5-anhydroglucitol, fructosamine, and insulin use were similar between groups. There were no severe hypoglycemia episodes or serious ADEs. Between-device AEs were comparable. Subjects scored better on six of seven subscales on the DSQOLS and five of six subscales on the IDSRQ while using bolus-patch versus pen/syringe. At study completion, 76% of subjects would choose to switch to bolus-patch (P=0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Delivery of mealtime insulin with bolus-patch compared with pen/syringe resulted in equivalent MDBG, lower SD and CV of seven-point blood glucose measurements, good safety, significant device satisfaction, and improved QOL.\n## Response:\n"}

Recently, investigations have shown an association between endogenous opioid peptides and inflammatory cells.\nAIMS: The aims of this study were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of an opioid antagonist, naltrexone, in children with moderate to severe Crohn's disease.\nMETHODS: A pilot clinical trial was conducted in children with moderate to severe Crohn's disease. Fourteen subjects with a mean age of 12.3 years (range, 8 to 17 y) were enrolled. Children were randomized to placebo or naltrexone (0.1 mg/kg) orally for 8 weeks followed by open-labeled treatment with 8 additional weeks of naltrexone. Safety and toxicity were monitored by physical examinations and blood chemistries. Clinical activity was assessed by the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) and Quality of life was monitored by the Impact III survey.\nRESULTS: Oral naltrexone was well tolerated without any serious adverse events in children with moderate to severe Crohn's disease. PCDAI scores significantly decreased from pretreatment values (34.2\u00b13.3) with an 8-week course of naltrexone therapy (21.7\u00b13.9) (P=0.005). Twenty-five percent of those treated with naltrexone were considered in remission (score \u226410) and 67% had improved with mild disease activity (decrease in PCDAI score by at least 10 points) at the end of the study. Systemic and social quality of life improved with naltrexone treatment (P=0.035).\nCONCLUSIONS: Naltrexone therapy seems safe with limited toxicity when given to children with Crohn's disease and may reduce disease activity.\n## Response:\n"}

The relationship between the frequency of church attendance and the mother-daughter relationship was also explored. A correlational analysis was conducted on 101 African-American adolescents and their maternalfigures recruitedfrom middle schools. Girls completed the Maternal Bonding, Mother-Adolescent Communication, and Maternal Monitoring scales while maternalfigures completed the parent versions of the Mother-Adolescent Communication and Monitoring Scales. The findings revealed that maternal monitoring, as perceived by girls and mothers, is related to increased communication between mothers and daughters. Greater church attendance was related to greater perceived maternal bonding for girls.

The aim of this trial was to determine whether oral SAMe administration to patients with hepatitis C cirrhosis would decrease serum \u03b1-fetoprotein (AFP) level, a biomarker of HCC risk in hepatitis C. This was a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of SAMe, up to 2.4 g/d, for 24 weeks as compared with placebo among subjects with hepatitis C cirrhosis and a mildly elevated serum AFP. Primary outcome was change in AFP between baseline and week 24. Secondary outcomes included changes in routine tests of liver function and injury, other biomarkers of HCC risk, SAMe metabolites, markers of oxidative stress, and quality of life. One hundred ten subjects were randomized and 87 (44 SAMe and 43 placebo) completed treatment. There was no difference in the change in AFP during 24 weeks among subjects receiving SAMe as compared with placebo. Changes in markers of liver function, liver injury, and hepatitis C viral level were not significantly different between groups. Similarly, SAMe did not change markers of oxidative stress or serum glutathione level. SAMe blood level increased significantly among subjects receiving SAMe. Changes in quality of life did not differ between groups. Overall, this trial did not find that SAMe treatment improved serum AFP in subjects with advanced hepatitis C cirrhosis and a mildly elevated AFP. SAMe did not improve tests of liver function or injury or markers of oxidative stress or antioxidant potential.\n## Response:\n"}

This study investigated whether cigarette demand predicted response to contingent monetary rewards for abstinence among individuals with substance use disorders. It also sought to replicate evidence for greater price sensitivity at whole-dollar pack price transitions (ie, left-digit effects).\nMETHODS: Participants (N = 338) were individuals in residential substance use disorder treatment who participated in a randomized controlled trial that compared contingent vouchers to noncontingent vouchers for smoking abstinence. Baseline demand indices were used to predict number of abstinent days during the 14-day voucher period (after the reduction lead-in) and at 1 and 3 months afterward.\nRESULTS: Demand indices correlated with measures of smoking and nicotine dependence. As measured by elasticity, intensity and O max, higher demand significantly predicted fewer abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings during voucher period for individuals in the noncontingent vouchers condition. Breakpoint exhibited a trend-level association with abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings. Demand indices did not predict abstinence in the contingent vouchers group, and did not predict abstinence at 1- and 3-month follow-ups. Left-digit price transitions were associated with significantly greater reductions in consumption.\nCONCLUSIONS: The association of cigarette demand with smoking behavior only in the group for whom abstinence was not incentivized indicates that CPT assesses the value of smoking more than the value of money per se and that vouchers counteract the effects of the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes. Results provide initial short-term evidence of predictive validity for the CPT indices.\nIMPLICATIONS: This study provides the first evidence of the validity of the CPT for predicting early response to brief advice for smoking cessation plus nicotine replacement in smokers with substance dependence. However, demand for cigarettes did not predict voucher-based treatment response, indicating that incentives serve as a powerful motivator not to smoke that acts in opposition to the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes and that the indices reflect the value of smoking more than the value of money per se.\n## Response:\n"}

The present study sought to determine if alcohol cue reactivity is attenuated by XR-NTX. Twenty-eight detoxified alcohol-dependent adult male and female volunteers received a single i.m. injection of either XR-NTX or placebo under double-blind conditions. An fMRI/cue reactivity procedure was conducted immediately before and two weeks after injection. At baseline, alcohol-related visual and olfactory cues elicited significant increases in orbital and cingulate gyri, inferior frontal and middle frontal gyri. Subsequently, brain activation was significantly altered in XR-NTX-treated individuals. These affected brain regions are associated with the integration of emotion, cognition, reward, punishment, and learning/memory, suggesting that XR-NTX attenuates the salience of alcohol-related cues. Such an effect on brain function may interrupt the processes associated with \"slips\" and relapse, which may account for XR-NTX's ability to maintain abstinence.\n## Response:\n"}

We assessed the prognostic value of these existing jeopardy scores, along with that of a new Lesion Score developed for the Alberta Provincial Project for Outcome Assessment in Coronary Heart Disease (APPROACH), a clinical data collection initiative capturing all patients undergoing cardiac catheterization in the province of Alberta.\nMETHODS: The predictive value of these three scores were compared in a cohort of >20,000 patients (9922 treated medically, 6334 treated with percutaneous intervention, and 3811 treated with bypass surgery). Scores were considered individually in logistic regression models for their ability to predict outcome and then added to models containing sociodemographic data, comorbidities, ejection fraction, indication for procedure, and descriptors of coronary anatomy.\nRESULTS: All scores were found to be predictive of 1-year mortality, especially when patients are treated medically or with percutaneous intervention. In these patients, the APPROACH Lesion Score performed slightly better than the other jeopardy scores. The Duke Jeopardy Score was most predictive in those patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery.\nCONCLUSIONS: Myocardial jeopardy scores provide independent prognostic information for patients with ischemic heart disease, especially if those patients are treated medically or with percutaneous intervention. These scores represent potentially valuable tools in cardiovascular outcome studies. The APPROACH Lesion Score may perform slightly better than previously developed jeopardy scores.\n## Response:\n"}

Clinical history, complete blood count, and biochemical markers were assessed in the first trimester. The trophoblast and angiogenesis markers ADAM-12, pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A, placental protein 13, placental growth factor, soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1, and endoglin were measured in a case-control subset of 174 women with preeclampsia and 509 women in the control group.\nRESULTS: Univariable analysis revealed maternal age, race, marital status, years of education, source of medical payment, prenatal caregiver, body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight (kg)/[height (m)]), and systolic blood pressure at enrollment were significantly associated with preeclampsia. Mean platelet volume was greater at enrollment in women who later had development of preeclampsia (median 9.4 compared with 9.0 femtoliter (fl); P=.02). First-trimester concentrations (multiples of the median) of ADAM-12 (1.14 compared with 1.04; P=.003), pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (0.94 compared with 0.98; P=.04), and placental growth factor (0.83 compared with 1.04; P<.001) were significantly different in women who had development of preeclampsia compared with women in the control group. The optimal multivariable model included African American race, systolic blood pressure, BMI, education level, ADAM-12, pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A, and placental growth factor, and yielded an area under the curve of 0.73 (95% confidence interval 0.69-0.77) and a sensitivity of 46.1% (95% confidence interval 38.3-54.0) for 80% specificity.\nCONCLUSION: A multivariable analysis of clinical data and biochemical markers in the first trimester did not identify a model that had clinical utility for predicting preeclampsia in a nulliparous population at low risk.\nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II.\n## Response:\n"}

Following screening/drug washout and a 5-week single-blind placebo-run-in with diet stabilization, subjects were randomized 2:1 to daily ezetimibe 10 mg (n = 93) or placebo (n = 45) for 12 weeks. Lipid-altering efficacy and safety were assessed in all treated patients.\nRESULTS: Overall, mean age was 8.3 years, 57% were girls, 80% were white, mean baseline LDL-C was 228 mg/dL (5.9 mmol/L), and 91% had HeFH. After 12 weeks, ezetimibe significantly reduced LDL-C by 27% after adjustment for placebo (P < .001) and produced significant reductions in total cholesterol (21%), nonhigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol (26%), and apolipoprotein B (20%) (P < .001 for all). LDL-C lowering response in sex, race, baseline lipids, and HeFH/nonFH subgroups was generally consistent with overall study results. Ezetimibe was well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to studies in older children, adolescents, and adults.\nCONCLUSIONS: Ezetimibe monotherapy produced clinically relevant reductions in LDL-C and other key lipid variables in young children with primary HeFH or clinically important nonFH, with a favorable safety/tolerability profile.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00867165.\n## Response:\n"}

The INS mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS) has well-documented efficacy and safety for the treatment and prophylaxis of nasal symptoms of seasonal AR (SAR) and for the treatment of nasal symptoms of perennial AR (PAR). Increasing interest has focused on whether INSs, including MFNS, may have beneficial effects on the ocular symptoms frequently associated with AR.\nMETHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of 10 randomized, placebo-controlled trials of the efficacy of MFNS 200 mcg daily in relieving ocular allergy symptoms, including itching/burning, redness, and tearing/watering in both SAR and PAR. Four PAR studies and six SAR studies are included in the analysis. A fixed-effect inverse variance model was used to calculate weighted mean differences, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each comparison, and a combined overall treatment effect (Z) with P-value.\nRESULTS: In both analyses of SAR and PAR studies, including 3132 patients, all individual ocular symptoms were reduced in patients treated with MFNS. Overall treatment effect was significant for all three individual ocular symptoms in the SAR studies (Z = 9.18 for tearing, Z = 10.15 for itching, and Z = 8.88 for redness; P < 0.00001 for all) and in the PAR studies (Z = 5.94, P < 0.00001 for tearing; Z = 2.43, P = 0.02 for itching; and Z = 2.42, P = 0.02 for redness).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings add to the growing body of literature supporting the positive class effect of INSs, including MFNS, on ocular symptoms associated with SAR and PAR.\n## Response:\n"}

However, there is growing evidence that B lymphocytes play a role in many T-lymphocyte-mediated diseases. It is possible to achieve selective depletion of B lymphocytes with rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody. This phase 2 study evaluated the role of B-lymphocyte depletion in patients with type 1 diabetes.\nMETHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind study in which 87 patients between 8 and 40 years of age who had newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes were assigned to receive infusions of rituximab or placebo on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of the study. The primary outcome, assessed 1 year after the first infusion, was the geometric mean area under the curve (AUC) for the serum C-peptide level during the first 2 hours of a mixed-meal tolerance test. Secondary outcomes included safety and changes in the glycated hemoglobin level and insulin dose.\nRESULTS: At 1 year, the mean AUC for the level of C peptide was significantly higher in the rituximab group than in the placebo group. The rituximab group also had significantly lower levels of glycated hemoglobin and required less insulin. Between 3 months and 12 months, the rate of decline in C-peptide levels in the rituximab group was significantly less than that in the placebo group. CD19+ B lymphocytes were depleted in patients in the rituximab group, but levels increased to 69% of baseline values at 12 months. More patients in the rituximab group than in the placebo group had adverse events, mostly grade 1 or grade 2, after the first infusion. The reactions appeared to be minimal with subsequent infusions. There was no increase in infections or neutropenia with rituximab.\nCONCLUSIONS: A four-dose course of rituximab partially preserved beta-cell function over a period of 1 year in patients with type 1 diabetes. The finding that B lymphocytes contribute to the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes may open a new pathway for exploration in the treatment of patients with this condition.

Primary end points were the proportion of subjects achieving a complete response (CR; no vomiting and no use of rescue medication) in the delayed phase (25-120 h after MEC initiation) and safety. Secondary end points included CR in the overall and acute phases (0-120 and 0-24 h after MEC initiation, respectively) and no vomiting in the overall phase. Nausea and the Functional Living Index-Emesis were assessed as exploratory end points.\nRESULTS: The fosaprepitant regimen improved CR significantly in the delayed (78.9% versus 68.5%; P < 0.001) and overall (77.1% versus 66.9%; P < 0.001) phases, but not in the acute phase (93.2% versus 91.0%; P = 0.184), versus control. In the overall phase, the proportion of subjects with no vomiting (82.7% versus 72.9%; P < 0.001) and no significant nausea (83.2% versus 77.9%; P = 0.030) was also significantly improved with the fosaprepitant regimen. The fosaprepitant regimen was generally well tolerated.\nCONCLUSION: Single-dose fosaprepitant added to a 5-HT3 RA and dexamethasone was well tolerated and demonstrated superior control of CINV (primary end point achieved) associated with non-AC MEC. This is the first study to evaluate NK1 RA therapy as an i.v. formulation in a well-defined non-AC MEC population.\nCLINICALTRIALSGOV: NCT01594749 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01594749).\n## Response:\n"}

All of the subjects underwent controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) using a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist (GnRH-ant) protocol. Over the 5-day fixed-dose regimen, the women received 150 IU/day of follitropin alpha biosimilar (n\u2009=\u200955) or original follitropin alpha (n\u2009=\u200955), followed by dose adaptation. The primary endpoint for assessing the therapeutic equivalence was the number of retrieved oocytes using a pre-determined clinical equivalence margin of \u00b1 3.4 oocytes.\nRESULTS: Similar numbers of oocytes were retrieved in both groups: 12.16\u2009\u00b1\u20097.28 in the follitropin alpha biosimilar group and 11.62\u2009\u00b1\u20096.29 in the original follitropin alpha group, with mean difference of 0.546\u2009\u00b1\u20091.297 oocytes (95% confidence interval [CI]: -2.026, 3.116), p\u2009=\u20090.002 (intention-to-treat [ITT] population). Additionally, no statistically significant differences were found for secondary endpoints: the onset of biochemical (34.7% and 36.7%, p\u2009=\u20090.883), clinical pregnancy (26.5% and 32.7%, p\u2009=\u20090.507), delivery (26.5% and 24.5%, p\u2009=\u20090.817) and take-home baby rate (28.6% and 26.5%, p\u2009=\u20090.816) for the follitropin biosimilar and original follitropin groups (per-protocol [PP] population). Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome was observed in subjects with a positive pregnancy test in 0% and 3.64% of cases and after triggering ovulation in 7.27% and 3.64% for the follitropin biosimilar and original follitropin groups, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated similar therapeutic equivalence and safety profiles between the follitropin alpha biosimilar and the reference follitropin in women who underwent COH in GnRH-ant cycles.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: RCT 754.

These abnormalities are thought to reflect a deficiency in the synchronization of pyramidal cell activity that is dependent, in part, on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission through GABA type A (GABA(A)) receptors containing alpha(2) subunits. The authors conducted a proof-of-concept clinical trial designed to test the hypothesis that a novel compound with relatively selective agonist activity at GABA(A) receptors containing alpha(2) subunits would improve cognitive function and gamma band oscillations in individuals with schizophrenia.\nMETHOD: Participants were male subjects (N=15) with chronic schizophrenia who were randomly assigned to receive 4 weeks of treatment with the study drug MK-0777, a benzodiazepine-like agent with selective activity at GABA(A) receptors containing alpha(2) or alpha(3) subunits, or a matched placebo in a double-blind fashion. Outcome measures were the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status, three tests of working memory and/or cognitive control (N-back, AX Continuous Performance Test, and Preparing to Overcome Prepotency), and EEG measures of gamma band oscillations induced during the Preparing to Overcome Prepotency task.\nRESULTS: Compared with placebo, the MK-0777 compound was associated with improved performance on the N-back, AX Continuous Performance Test, and Preparing to Overcome Prepotency tasks. The compound was also associated with increased frontal gamma band power during the Preparing to Overcome Prepotency task. No effects of the MK-0777 compound were detected in BPRS or Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status scores, with the exception of improvement on the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status delayed memory index. The MK-0777 agent was well-tolerated.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings provide preliminary support for the hypothesis that enhanced GABA activity at alpha(2) subunit containing GABA(A) receptors improves behavioral and electrophysiological measures of prefrontal function in individuals with schizophrenia.\n## Response:\n"}

After 24 weeks, PBO patients were rerandomized to either ATX titration strategy. Efficacy measures included the Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale Total ADHD Symptoms score, Clinical Global Impression-ADHD-Severity, Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. General and titration safety measures and tolerability were evaluated.\nRESULTS: Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale Total ADHD Symptoms score reduction was greater with ATX over PBO at 12 weeks (-14.33 vs -10.05; P < 0.001) and 24 weeks (-16.43 vs -8.65; P < 0.001; effect size, 0.57). Response (25% decrease on Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale Total ADHD Symptoms) was greater for ATX (68%) than PBO (42%; P < 0.001) at 24 weeks. Clinical Global Impression-ADHD-Severity improvement was greater for ATX over PBO at 8 and 24 weeks (P < 0.001; effect sizes, 0.45 and 0.46, respectively). There were no significant changes in depressive or anxiety measures for either group. Discontinuation due to an adverse event was greater for on-label versus slow titration, although the rate of patients experiencing adverse events were comparable. Common adverse events included dry mouth, nausea, and decreased appetite.\nCONCLUSIONS: Atomoxetine demonstrated significant improvement in ADHD symptoms at 12 and 24 weeks over PBO. Adverse events overall and for on-label or slow titration to ATX were similar and consistent with previous adult ATX studies.\n## Response:\n"}

This study used a mixed methods design to examine participant changes in selected domains 6 months after enrollment in a Canadian field trial of Housing First.\nMETHODS: The study sample included 301 participants receiving the Housing First intervention at the Toronto site of the At Home/Chez Soi project. This study used a pre-post design to compare quantitative 6-month outcome data to baseline values in key domains and multivariate regression to identify baseline demographic, clinical or service use variables associated with observed changes in these domains. In addition, qualitative data exploring participant and service provider perspectives and experiences was collected via stakeholder interviews and focus groups, and analyzed using thematic analysis.\nRESULTS: The majority (60 to 72%) of participants followed the expected trajectory of improvement, with the remaining experiencing difficulties in community integration, mental health symptom severity, substance use, community functioning and quality of life 6 months after program enrollment. Diagnosis of psychotic disorder was associated with a reduction in quality of life from baseline to 6-months, while substance use disorders were associated with reduced mental illness symptoms and substance use related problems and an improvement in quality of life. Participants housed in independent housing at 6-months had greater improvements in community integration and quality of life, and greater reduction in mental illness symptoms, compared to those not independently housed. The quality of the working alliance was positively associated with improvements in physical and psychological community integration and quality of life. Qualitative data provided a unique window into the loneliness and isolation experienced by Housing First participants, as well as problems related to substance use and a need for life skills training and support.\nCONCLUSIONS: Additional strategies can help support Housing First participants in the early stages of program participation and address potential causes of early difficulties, including lack of life skills and social isolation. This study highlights the importance of early and ongoing evaluation, monitoring and program adaptations to address consumer support needs.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN42520374.\n## Response:\n"}

A direct relationship between postoperative hyperglycemia and mortality has been established in diabetic patients undergoing cardiac surgery. However, this relationship might be confounded because patients with poor outcome receive more glucogenic drugs postoperatively. We assessed the influence of hyperglycemia (highest glucose level) during cardiopulmonary bypass on perioperative morbidity and mortality in diabetic and nondiabetic patients.\nMETHODS: We performed a multivariate logistic regression analysis on all diabetic (n = 1579) and nondiabetic (n = 4701) patients undergoing cardiac surgery at the Toronto General Hospital between 1999 and 2001. Boluses of insulin were given during cardiopulmonary bypass when the glucose level exceeded 15 mmol/L, when the serum potassium level exceeded 6.0 mmol/L, or both.\nRESULTS: Overall mortality was 1.8% (n = 115). A high glucose level during cardiopulmonary bypass was an independent predictor of mortality in both diabetic (odds ratio, 1.20; confidence interval, 1.08-1.32) and nondiabetic (odds ratio, 1.12; confidence interval, 1.06-1.19; per millimole per liter increase in glucose) patients. A high glucose level during cardiopulmonary bypass was also an independent predictor of all major adverse events in both patient groups (odds ratio, 1.06; confidence interval, 1.03-1.09). A high glucose level was not closely related to cardiopulmonary bypass (r = 0.3) or aortic crossclamp times (r = 0.4).\nCONCLUSIONS: A high peak serum glucose level during cardiopulmonary bypass is an independent risk factor for death and morbidity in diabetic patients and unexpectedly also in nondiabetic patients.\n## Response:\n"}

Participants with symptom onset within 8 days were enrolled, then transfused within the subsequent day. The measured primary outcome was COVID-19-related hospitalization within 28 days of plasma transfusion. The enrollment period was June 3, 2020 to October 1, 2021.\nRESULTS: A total of 1225 participants were randomized and 1181 transfused. In the pre-specified modified intention-to-treat analysis that excluded those not transfused, the primary endpoint occurred in 37 of 589 (6.3%) who received placebo control plasma and in 17 of 592 (2.9%) participants who received convalescent plasma (relative risk, 0.46; one-sided 95% upper bound confidence interval 0.733; P=0.004) corresponding to a 54% risk reduction. Examination with a model adjusting for covariates related to the outcome did not change the conclusions.\nCONCLUSION: Early administration of high titer SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma reduced outpatient hospitalizations by more than 50%. High titer convalescent plasma is an effective early outpatient COVID-19 treatment with the advantages of low cost, wide availability, and rapid resilience to variant emergence from viral genetic drift in the face of a changing pandemic.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04373460.\n## Response:\n"}

A parallel group, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was undertaken in three centres, recruiting 160 outpatients with MS experiencing significant problems from at least one of the following: spasticity, spasms, bladder problems, tremor or pain. The interventions were oromucosal sprays of matched placebo, or whole plant CBME containing equal amounts of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) at a dose of 2.5-120 mg of each daily, in divided doses. The primary outcome measure was a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score for each patient's most troublesome symptom. Additional measures included VAS scores of other symptoms, and measures of disability, cognition, mood, sleep and fatigue. Following CBME the primary symptom score reduced from mean (SE) 74.36 (11.1) to 48.89 (22.0) following CBME and from 74.31 (12.5) to 54.79 (26.3) following placebo [ns]. Spasticity VAS scores were significantly reduced by CBME (Sativex) in comparison with placebo (P =0.001). There were no significant adverse effects on cognition or mood and intoxication was generally mild.\n## Response:\n"}

Currently, intensive speech therapy is the mainstay of treatment, although its efficacy has been variable at best. Recent years have seen the emergence of non-invasive brain stimulation, specifically Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS), as potential treatments for post-stroke aphasia. A growing body of investigations has shown the efficacy of both modalities in facilitating recovery from chronic aphasia, while data regarding subacute aphasia are much more limited and evidence in the acute post-stroke phase are still lacking. Much remains unknown about how these techniques cause clinical improvement or about their long-term efficacy, side-effects, and safety. In this article, we examine the data demonstrating the safety and efficacy of TMS and tDCS, discuss the major differences between them, and consider how those differences may inform the use of each modality. We also consider the different models of neuroplasticity in the setting of post-stroke aphasia and how these models may influence when and in which patients each modality would impart the most benefit.\n## Response:\n"}

Month 7\nAbstract: Female sex workers in low priced brothel areas in Denpasar, Bali, Indonesia participated in an intervention study designed to promote condom use and sexually transmitted disease (STD)/AIDS prevention. The intervention provided educational sessions for sex workers, STD treatment for sex workers, condom distribution, and media for clients. The brothel areas were divided into high and low areas for programme effort. The high effort areas received a more intensive behavioural intervention than the low effort areas. A clinic was available for STD treatment in both areas. Behavioural surveys and STD testing were used to evaluate the programmes. About 600 were evaluated for several STDs and completed personal interviews at enrolment and at six-month intervals during the 18-month study. About 50% of women were new to the study at each round. Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing of cervical swabbed specimens, using polymerase chain reaction methodology, was performed at the beginning of the study and 18 months later. Human papillomavirus infection was initially high in these women (38.3%) and declined to 29.7% after 18 months (P <0.01). The prevalence of HPV infection declined with age (P <0.01). HPV infection was associated with a number of STD symptoms that were reported in personal interviews. These associations were stronger in the first time period. Infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae was associated with HPV infection at baseline (P =0.03). HPV infection declined in the study area with the more intensive educational programme (P <0.01). The prevalence of HPV infection declined over time and was associated with study area and age of woman.\n## Response:\n"}

There had been no placebo-controlled, randomized, clinical trial of desloratadine (DL) in patients with persistent allergic rhinitis to date.\nOBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of DL in patients with persistent allergic rhinitis based on the ARIA classification.\nMETHODS: Patients 12 years of age and older with persistent allergic rhinitis were assessed over 85 days of treatment with DL 5 mg once daily (n = 360) or placebo (n = 356). The primary endpoint was the AM/PM reflective total 5-symptom score (T5SS) averaged over days 1-29. Secondary endpoints included AM/PM instantaneous T5SS and individual symptoms, therapeutic response, symptom severity assessed by a visual analogue scale and quality of life.\nRESULTS: The mean reduction in AM/PM reflective T5SS was significantly greater with DL than placebo over days 1-29 (-3.76 vs. -2.87, p < 0.001) and on each individual day (p < 0.05). The mean AM instantaneous T5SS was significantly reduced with DL compared with placebo as early as day 2 (-1.90 vs. -1.46; p < 0.001). The therapeutic response and improvement in quality of life were significantly greater with DL than placebo (p < 0.001 for each). The frequency of treatment-related adverse events was low and similar between DL (10.0%) and placebo (8.4%).\nCONCLUSIONS: This study showed DL to be effective and safe in the treatment of persistent allergic rhinitis.\n## Response:\n"}

We conducted a randomized trial comparing alendronate 70 mg combined with vitamin D(3) 5,600 IU in a single tablet (ALN/D5600, n = 257) with standard care chosen by the patients' personal physicians (n = 258) in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis (BMD T score \u22642.5 or \u22641.5 and a prior fragility fracture) who had vitamin D insufficiency (serum 25[OH]D values 8-20 ng/ml) and who were at risk of falls. Virtually all patients randomized to standard care received bisphosphonate therapy, and in approximately 70% of cases this was combined with vitamin D supplements. However, only 24% took \u2265800 IU/day of supplemental vitamin D. At 6 months the proportion of patients with vitamin D insufficiency was 8.6% in the ALN/D5600 group compared with 31.0% in the standard care group (P < 0.001). Those in the ALN/D5600 group also had a greater reduction in urinary NTX/creatinine ratio (-57% vs. -46%, P < 0.001) and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (-47% vs. -40%, P < 0.001). In the ALN/5600 group, by 12 months the increase in BMD was greater at the lumbar spine (4.9% vs. 3.9%, P = 0.047) and the total hip (2.2% vs. 1.4%, P = 0.035), significantly fewer patients were vitamin D-insufficient (11.3% vs. 36.9%, P < 0.001), and bone turnover marker (BTM) results were similar to those at 6 months. There was no difference between groups in those who experienced falls or fractures, and adverse events were similar. Based on the finding that ALN/D5600 was more effective than standard care at correcting vitamin D insufficiency, increasing BMD, and reducing BTMs in this patient group, greater attention needs to be directed toward optimizing the treatment of osteoporosis and correcting vitamin D deficiency in postmenopausal women.\n## Response:\n"}

Patients were analyzed descriptively.\nRESULTS: Forty of 139 registered patients reported adverse events in the glabellar region. All patients were female, with an average age of 52.3. Nineteen patients with adverse reactions to hydroxyethylmethacrylate (HEMA) and ethylmethacrylate (EMA) in a fixed combination with hyaluronic acid (HA) and 10 patients with adverse reactions to different hyaluronic acid products were reported; five patients reacted to poly-L-lactic acid (PLA). The most common adverse reactions to HEMA/EMA in HA and PLA were nodules and hardening. In HA-treated patients, erythema and inflammation, swelling, and pain were most frequent. The adverse reactions to HEMA/EMA in HA were severe in 50% of the patients. Severe adverse reactions were found to a lesser extent in patients treated with HA and PLA. Potential vascular complications were documented in only two patients.\nCONCLUSION: Adverse reactions seen in the glabella are overwhelmingly product associated and to a lesser extent location associated.

Intervention is superior to HIV Knowledge Control in terms of Number of Participants With Occurrence of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) at 12 Months 12 months\nAbstract: Young gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) experience sexual health disparities due to a lack of support in settings that traditionally promote positive youth development. The Internet may help to fill this void, but little is known about how it is used for sexual health purposes among young MSM. This mixed-methods study reports quantitative results of a large survey of 18- to 24-year-old MSM in an HIV testing clinic (N\u00a0=\u00a0329) as well as qualitative results from interviews. Level of Internet use was high in this sample and the majority of participants reported using the Internet to find HIV/AIDS information. Black and Latino youth used the Internet less frequently than White youth, and after controlling for age, education, and frequency of Internet use, Black youth were 70% less likely to use the Internet to find HIV/AIDS information. Qualitative analyses identified themes related to the role of the Internet in finding sexual health information, sexual minority identity development, and sexual risk taking behaviors. Participants reported that the Internet filled an important and unmet need for sexual health education. It allowed for connections to the gay community and support during the coming out process, but also exposure to homophobic messages. There was no evidence of increased risk behaviors with partners met online, but at the same time the potential for the use of the Internet to facilitate safer sex communication was largely untapped. Our findings generally present an optimistic picture about the role of the Internet in the development of sexual health among young MSM.\n## Response:\n"}

An injection of autologous blood might provide the necessary cellular and humoral mediators to induce a healing cascade. The purpose of this study was to evaluate prospectively the results of refractory lateral epicondylitis treated with autologous blood injections.\nMETHOD: Twenty-eight patients with lateral epicondylitis were injected with 2 mL of autologous blood under the extensor carpi radialis brevis. All patients had failed previous nonsurgical treatments including all or combinations of physical therapy, splinting, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication, and prior steroid injections. Patients kept personal logs and rated their pain (0-10) and categorized themselves according to Nirschl staging (0-7) daily.\nRESULTS: The average follow-up period was 9.5 months (range, 6-24 mo). After autologous blood injections the average pain score decreased from 7.8 to 2.3. The average Nirschl stage decreased from 6.5 to 2.0. For the 9 patients receiving more than one blood injection the mean pain score and Nirschl stage before injection were 7.2 and 6.6, respectively. After the second blood injection the pain and Nirschl scores were both 0.9. Two patients received a third blood injection that brought both pain and Nirschl scores to 0.\nCONCLUSIONS: After autologous blood injection therapy 22 patients (79%) in whom nonsurgical modalities had failed were relieved completely of pain even during strenuous activity. This study offers encouraging results of an alternative minimally invasive treatment that addresses the pathophysiology of lateral epicondylitis that has failed traditional nonsurgical modalities.\n## Response:\n"}

Sleep outcomes (sleep onset latency, total wake time, wake after sleep onset, sleep efficiency, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) were compared between CBTI and control at 6 months using repeated-measures analysis of variance adjusted for baseline values. AHI of 5 or greater versus less than 5 was included as an interaction term to evaluate changes in sleep outcomes. The number of participants at baseline and 6 months with mild SDB for whom insomnia was their only other indication for PAP was also compared between CBTI and control.\nRESULTS: AHI status (AHI \u2265 5 [75.5% of participants] versus AHI < 5) did not moderate improvements in sleep associated with CBTI (all p values \u2265 .12). Nine (45.0%) of 20 participants with mild SDB for whom insomnia was their only other indication for PAP therapy at baseline no longer had another indication for PAP at 6 months, with no significant difference between CBTI and control.\nCONCLUSIONS: CBTI improves sleep in older veterans with insomnia and untreated mild SDB. Larger trials are needed to assess whether CBTI reduces the number of patients with mild SDB eligible for PAP.\n## Response:\n"}

Ancillary care services examined include case management, mental health and substance abuse treatment/counseling, advocacy, respite and buddy/companion services, as well as food, housing, emergency financial assistance, and transportation. The selection criterion used was the receipt of care from January-June 1997 at selected facilities receiving funding under the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act, a federally funded safety net programme in the USA. The receipt of each ancillary service was associated with the receipt of any primary medical care from a safety net provider. All ancillary services were more strongly associated with primary care receipt than with retention in care or the mean number of primary care visits per year. Mental health and substance abuse treatment/counselling, client advocacy, respite care and buddy/companion services all had significant associations with all primary medical care measures. This is the first time in one study that the primary medical and ancillary services received by all clients at safety net-funded providers from multiple cities and states have been examined. All types of safety net providers, from the largest medical centre to the smallest community-based organization, are represented in this study. The patterns seen here are similar to the findings from the other, geographically more restricted, studies reported on in this volume.\n## Response:\n"}

In this pilot study, metabolomics has been applied to serum samples from women with metastatic breast cancer to explore outcomes and response to treatment.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Pre-treatment and serial on-treatment serum samples were available from an international clinical trial in which 579 women with metastatic breast cancer were randomized to paclitaxel plus either a targeted anti-HER2 treatment (lapatinib) or placebo. Serum metabolomic profiles were obtained using 600 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Profiles were compared with time to progression, overall survival and treatment toxicity.\nRESULTS: Pre- and on-treatment serum samples were assessed for over 500 patients. Unbiased metabolomic profiles in the biologically unselected overall trial population did not correlate with outcome or toxicity. In a subgroup of patients with HER2-positive disease treated with paclitaxel plus lapatinib, metabolomic profiles from patients in the upper and lower thirds of the dataset showed significant differences for time to progression (N = 22, predictive accuracy = 89.6%) and overall survival (N = 16, predictive accuracy = 78.0%).\nCONCLUSIONS: In metastatic breast cancer, metabolomics may play a role in sub selecting patients with HER2 positive disease with greater sensitivity to paclitaxel plus lapatinib.\n## Response:\n"}

Participants received NuvaRing or COC for 13 cycles (3 weeks of ring/pill treatment followed by a 1-week ring-free/pill-free period). Contraceptive efficacy was assessed by in-treatment pregnancies and expressed by the Pearl Index (PI; number of pregnancies/100 woman-years of use). Cycle control was assessed by unscheduled (breakthrough) and absence of scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding events. Safety and tolerability were assessed throughout the study.\nRESULTS: Participants were randomised either to the NuvaRing (n\u2009=\u2009732) or to the COC (n\u2009=\u2009214); 588 (82.4%) and 182 (78.4%) participants, respectively, completed the study. There were 10 in-treatment pregnancies in the NuvaRing group (PI 1.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.92, 3.53) and five in the COC group (PI 3.12; 95% CI 1.01, 7.29). Breakthrough bleeding/spotting ranged from 18.6% (Cycle 1) to 4.2% (Cycle 11) for NuvaRing and from 21.6% (Cycle 1) to 7.9% (Cycle 11) for COC. Absence of withdrawal bleeding ranged from 8.6% (Cycle 1) to 3.0% (Cycle 11) for NuvaRing and from 14.6% (Cycle 1) to 6.4% (Cycle 5) for COC. For NuvaRing and COC, respectively, 26.6% and 25.0% of participants had treatment-related adverse events, and 7.0% and 9.1% discontinued the study as a result.\nCONCLUSIONS: Once-monthly NuvaRing is efficacious and safe for use in Chinese women.\n## Response:\n"}

The Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet Research Group and the European C-peptide Trial (ECPT) Study Group conducted parallel randomized studies to compare the sensitivity, reproducibility, and tolerability of these procedures.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In randomized sequences, 148 TrialNet subjects completed 549 tests with up to 2 MMTT and 2 GST tests on separate days, and 118 ECPT subjects completed 348 tests (up to 3 each) with either two MMTTs or two GSTs.\nRESULTS: Among individuals with up to 4 years' duration of type 1 diabetes, >85% had measurable stimulated C-peptide values. The MMTT stimulus produced significantly higher concentrations of C-peptide than the GST. Whereas both tests were highly reproducible, the MMTT was significantly more so (R(2) = 0.96 for peak C-peptide response). Overall, the majority of subjects preferred the MMTT, and there were few adverse events. Some older subjects preferred the shorter duration of the GST. Nausea was reported in the majority of GST studies, particularly in the young age-group.\nCONCLUSIONS: The MMTT is preferred for the assessment of beta-cell function in therapeutic trials in type 1 diabetes.\n## Response:\n"}

The trial randomized 660 patients with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycemic control on insulin, with or without metformin (\u22651500\u00a0mg/day) or sulfonylurea, for \u226510\u00a0weeks. Patients could remain on metformin but not sulfonylurea after randomization.\nRESULTS: The increase from baseline in the daily dose of insulin was less in the sitagliptin group (N\u00a0=\u00a0329) compared to placebo (N\u00a0=\u00a0329) (between group difference\u00a0=\u00a0-4.7\u00a0IU [95% confidence interval [CI] -8.3, -1.2]; p\u00a0=\u00a00.009). Patients in the sitagliptin group had lower glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels after 24\u00a0weeks (between-group difference of -0.4% [95% CI -0.6, -0.3; -4.9\u00a0mmol/mol (95% CI -6.6, -3.2)]; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and more patients in the sitagliptin group reached the HbA1c goal of <7.0% (53\u00a0mmol/mol), with a between-group difference of 17.3% (95% CI 10.4%, 24.1%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Fewer patients in the sitagliptin group experienced an adverse event of hypoglycemia (between-group difference\u00a0=\u00a0-15.5%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).\nCONCLUSION: Administration of sitagliptin prior to intensive titration of basal insulin glargine reduces the insulin dose requirement while providing superior glycemic control and less hypoglycemia, compared to an insulin-only regimen.\nFUNDING: Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA.\n## Response:\n"}

The authors conducted a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial titled \"Depression in Alzheimer's Disease-2\" to assess the efficacy and tolerability of sertraline for depression in AD.\nMETHODS: One hundred thirty-one participants from five U.S. medical centers with mild-to-moderate AD (Mini-Mental State Examination scores 10-26) and depression of AD were randomized to double-blinded treatment with sertraline (N = 67) or placebo (N = 64), with a target dosage of 100 mg daily. Efficacy was assessed using logistic regressions and mixed effects models in an intention-to-treat analysis with imputation of missing data. Principal outcome measures were modified Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change (mADCS-CGIC), change in Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) scores, and remission defined by both mADCS-CGIC score <or=2 and CSDD score <or=6.\nRESULTS: mADCS-CGIC ratings (odd ratio [OR = 1.01], 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.52-1.97, p = 0.98), CSDD scores (median difference at 12 weeks 1.2, 95% CI: 1.65-4.05, p = 0.41), and remission at 12 weeks of follow-up (OR = 2.06, 95% CI: 0.84-5.04, p = 0.11) did not differ between sertraline (N = 67) and placebo (N = 64). Sertraline-treated patients experienced more adverse events, most notably gastrointestinal and respiratory, than placebo-treated patients.\nCONCLUSION: Sertraline did not demonstrate efficacy for the treatment depression symptoms in patients with AD. In addition, its use was associated with an increased incidence of adverse events. Thus, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may be of limited value for treating depression in patients with AD.\n## Response:\n"}

Such neuronal plastic changes may involve activation of central nervous system excitatory amino acid (EAA) receptors, subsequent intracellular cascades including protein kinase C translocation and activation as well as nitric oxide production, leading to the functional modulation of receptor-ion channel complexes. Similar EAA receptor-mediated cellular and intracellular mechanisms have now been implicated in the development of tolerance to the analgesic effects of morphine, and a site of action involved in both hyperalgesia and morphine tolerance is likely to be in the superficial laminae of the spinal cord dorsal horn. These observations suggest that hyperalgesia and morphine tolerance, two seemingly unrelated phenomena, may be interrelated by common neural substrates that interact at the level of EAA receptor activation and related intracellular events. This view is supported by recent observations showing that thermal hyperalgesia develops when animals are made tolerant to morphine antinociception and that both hyperalgesia and reduction of the antinociceptive effects of morphine occur as a consequence of peripheral nerve injury. The demonstration of interrelationships between neural mechanisms underlying hyperalgesia and morphine tolerance may lead to a better understanding of the neurobiology of these two phenomena in particular and pain in general. This knowledge may also provide a scientific basis for improved pain management with opiate analgesics.\n## Response:\n"}

We confirm the efficacy and safety of 25 \u03bcg desmopressin orally disintegrating tablet compared to placebo in female patients.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: In this 3-month, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study 25 \u03bcg desmopressin once daily was compared to placebo in women with nocturia (2 or more nocturnal voids). The co-primary efficacy end points were change from baseline in mean number of nocturnal voids and proportion of patients achieving at least a 33% reduction from baseline in the mean number of nocturnal voids (33% responders).\nRESULTS: The full analysis set comprised 261 patients (age range 19 to 87 years). Desmopressin significantly reduced the mean number of nocturnal voids and increased the odds of a 33% or greater response compared to placebo during 3 months, assessed by longitudinal analysis (-0.22, p = 0.028 and OR 1.85, p = 0.006, respectively). Desmopressin increased the mean time to first nocturnal void by 49 minutes compared to placebo at 3 months (p = 0.003). The response to desmopressin was seen by week 1 of treatment and was sustained throughout the trial. Significant increases in health related quality of life and sleep quality were observed compared to placebo. Desmopressin was well tolerated. Serum sodium levels remained greater than 125 mmol/L throughout the trial and 3 transient decreases to less than 130 mmol/L were recorded.\nCONCLUSIONS: At a dose of 25 \u03bcg, desmopressin orally disintegrating tablet is an effective and well tolerated treatment for women with nocturia. Treatment provides rapid and sustained improvement in nocturia and quality of life.\n## Response:\n"}

First, the authors tested the hypothesis that during propofol anesthesia alone and combined with indomethacin, changes in CBF, cerebral blood volume (CBV), and plasma mean transit time (MTT) differ in the peritumoral tissue compared with the contralateral normal brain region. Second, the authors tested the hypothesis that CBF and CBV are reduced and MTT is prolonged, in both regions during propofol anesthesia and indomethacin administration compared with propofol alone.\nMETHODS: The authors studied eight patients subjected to craniotomy under propofol-fentanyl anesthesia for supratentorial brain tumors. Magnetic resonance imaging, including perfusion- and diffusion-weighted and structural sequences, was performed (1) on the day before surgery, (2) before and (3) after administration of indomethacin in the propofol-fentanyl anesthetized patient, and (4) 2 days after surgery. Maps of CBF, CBV, and MTT were calculated. The regions of interest were peritumoral gray matter and opposite contralateral gray matter. Analysis of variance was used to analyze flow data.\nRESULTS: Propofol anesthesia was associated with a median 32% (range, 3-61%) and 47% (range, 17-67%) reduction in CBF in the peritumoral and contralateral regions, respectively.The interaction between intervention with propofol and indomethacin and region of interest was not significant for any flow modalities. Neither intervention nor region was significant for MTT, CBF, and CBV (P > 0.05).\nCONCLUSION: The CBF, CBV, and MTT responses to propofol and indomethacin are not different in the peritumoral region compared with contralateral brain tissue.

Whether adults with obesity can achieve weight loss with once-weekly semaglutide at a dose of 2.4 mg as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention has not been confirmed.\nMETHODS: In this double-blind trial, we enrolled 1961 adults with a body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 30 or greater (\u226527 in persons with \u22651 weight-related coexisting condition), who did not have diabetes, and randomly assigned them, in a 2:1 ratio, to 68 weeks of treatment with once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide (at a dose of 2.4 mg) or placebo, plus lifestyle intervention. The coprimary end points were the percentage change in body weight and weight reduction of at least 5%. The primary estimand (a precise description of the treatment effect reflecting the objective of the clinical trial) assessed effects regardless of treatment discontinuation or rescue interventions.\nRESULTS: The mean change in body weight from baseline to week 68 was -14.9% in the semaglutide group as compared with -2.4% with placebo, for an estimated treatment difference of -12.4 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], -13.4 to -11.5; P<0.001). More participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group achieved weight reductions of 5% or more (1047 participants [86.4%] vs. 182 [31.5%]), 10% or more (838 [69.1%] vs. 69 [12.0%]), and 15% or more (612 [50.5%] vs. 28 [4.9%]) at week 68 (P<0.001 for all three comparisons of odds). The change in body weight from baseline to week 68 was -15.3 kg in the semaglutide group as compared with -2.6 kg in the placebo group (estimated treatment difference, -12.7 kg; 95% CI, -13.7 to -11.7). Participants who received semaglutide had a greater improvement with respect to cardiometabolic risk factors and a greater increase in participant-reported physical functioning from baseline than those who received placebo. Nausea and diarrhea were the most common adverse events with semaglutide; they were typically transient and mild-to-moderate in severity and subsided with time. More participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group discontinued treatment owing to gastrointestinal events (59 [4.5%] vs. 5 [0.8%]).\nCONCLUSIONS: In participants with overweight or obesity, 2.4 mg of semaglutide once weekly plus lifestyle intervention was associated with sustained, clinically relevant reduction in body weight.

On the basis of the clinical benefit reported in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma treated in a phase 1 study of vorinostat, we designed this phase 3 trial to investigate whether vorinostat given as a second-line or third-line therapy improved patients' overall survival.\nMETHODS: This double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial was done in 90 international centres. Patients with measurable advanced malignant pleural mesothelioma and disease progression after one or two previous systemic regimens were eligible. After stratification for Karnofsky performance status, histology, and number of previous chemotherapy regimens, patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by use of an interactive voice response system with a block size of four to either treatment with vorinostat or placebo. Patients received oral vorinostat 300 mg (or matching placebo) twice daily on days 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10, 15, 16, and 17 of a 21-day cycle. The primary endpoints were overall survival and safety and tolerability of vorinostat. The primary efficacy comparison was done in the intention-to-treat population, and safety and tolerability was assessed in the treated population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00128102.\nFINDINGS: From July 12, 2005, to Feb 14, 2011, 661 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either vorinostat (n=329) or placebo (n=332) and included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Median overall survival for vorinostat was 30\u00b77 weeks (95% CI 26\u00b77-36\u00b71) versus 27\u00b71 weeks (23\u00b71-31\u00b79) for placebo (hazard ratio 0\u00b798, 95% CI 0\u00b783-1\u00b717, p=0\u00b786). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events for patients treated with vorinostat were fatigue or malaise (51 [16%] patients in the vorinostat group vs 25 [8%] in the placebo group]) and dyspnoea (35 [11%] vs 45 [14%]).\nINTERPRETATION: In this randomised trial, vorinostat given as a second-line or third-line therapy did not improve overall survival and cannot be recommended as a therapy for patients with advanced malignant pleural mesothelioma.\nFUNDING: Merck & Co.\n## Response:\n"}

We conducted a randomized clinical trial comparing T-CBT with telephone-delivered pain education (T-EDU). A total of 98 military veterans with chronic pain were enrolled in the study and randomized into one of two treatment conditions. Study participants were recruited from primary-care clinics at an urban VA medical center and affiliated VA community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs). Pain management outcomes were measured at midtreatment (10 weeks), posttreatment (20 weeks), 3-month follow-up (32 weeks), and 6-month follow-up (46 weeks). No significant differences were found between the two treatment groups on any of the outcome measures. Both treatment groups reported small but significant increases in level of physical and mental health, and reductions in pain and depressive symptoms. Improvements in all primary outcome measures were mediated by reductions in catastrophizing.

End of Treatment Intervention Phase I (week 6) and End of Treatment Intervention Period II (week 14)\nAbstract: Treatment with prescription omega-3-acid ethyl esters (POM3) reduces triglycerides (TG) and TG-rich lipoprotein particles, but has been associated with increased fasting glucose (2-6mg/dL). This double-blind, randomized, controlled crossover trial in 19 men and women with hypertriglyceridemia (fasting TG \u2265150 and \u2264499mg/dL) examined lipid responses and indices of insulin sensitivity and secretion following a liquid meal tolerance test. Six weeks treatment with POM3 vs. corn oil resulted in significant lower mean fasting (-50.1mg/dL, p<0.001) and postprandial TG (-76.1mg/dL, p<0.001), higher mean fasting glucose (2.8mg/dL, p=0.062), reduced mean disposition index (2.1 vs. 2.4, p=0.037), and no change in the median Matsuda composite insulin sensitivity index (3.3 vs. 3.2, p=0.959). These results suggest that POM3 slightly reduces pancreatic \u03b2-cell responsiveness to plasma glucose elevation, which may contribute to the rise in fasting glucose sometimes observed with POM3.\n## Response:\n"}

Thirty patients with a Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC/TMD) diagnosis of myofascial pain were randomized to receive either single-session botulinum toxin injections (Group A) or multiple-session Fascial Manipulation (Group B). Maximum pain levels (VAS ratings) and jaw range of motion in millimeters (maximum mouth opening, protrusion, right and left laterotrusion) were assessed at baseline, at the end of treatment, and at a three-month follow-up. Both treatment protocols provided significant improvement over time for pain symptoms. The two treatments seem to be almost equally effective, Fascial Manipulation being slightly superior to reduce subjective pain perception, and botulinum toxin injections being slightly superior to increase jaw range of motion. Differences between the two treatment protocols as to changes in the outcome parameters at the three-months follow-up were not relevant clinically. Findings from the present investigation are in line with literature data supporting the effectiveness of a wide spectrum of conservative treatment approaches to myofascial pain of the jaw muscles.

Time points of measurement: 72 hours after ROSC.\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Animal data on cardiac arrest showed improved long-term survival with combined vasopressin-epinephrine. In cardiac arrest, cortisol levels are relatively low during and after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. We hypothesized that combined vasopressin-epinephrine and corticosteroid supplementation during and after resuscitation may improve survival in refractory in-hospital cardiac arrest.\nMETHODS: We conducted a single-center, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial. We enrolled 100 consecutive patients with cardiac arrest requiring epinephrine according to current resuscitation guidelines. Patients received either vasopressin (20 IU per cardiopulmonary resuscitation cycle) plus epinephrine (1 mg per resuscitation cycle) (study group; n = 48) or isotonic sodium chloride solution placebo plus epinephrine (1 mg per resuscitation cycle) (control group; n = 52) for the first 5 resuscitation cycles after randomization, followed by additional epinephrine if needed. On the first resuscitation cycle, study group patients received methylprednisolone sodium succinate (40 mg) and controls received saline placebo. Postresuscitation shock was treated with stress-dose hydrocortisone sodium succinate (300 mg daily for 7 days maximum, with gradual taper) (27 patients in the study group) or saline placebo (15 patients in the control group). Primary end points were return of spontaneous circulation for 15 minutes or longer and survival to hospital discharge.\nRESULTS: Study group patients vs controls had more frequent return of spontaneous circulation (39 of 48 patients [81%] vs 27 of 52 [52%]; P = .003) and improved survival to hospital discharge (9 [19%] vs 2 [4%]; P = .02). Study group patients with postresuscitation shock vs corresponding controls had improved survival to hospital discharge (8 of 27 patients [30%] vs 0 of 15 [0%]; P = .02), improved hemodynamics and central venous oxygen saturation, and more organ failure-free days. Adverse events were similar in the 2 groups.\nCONCLUSION: In this single-center trial, combined vasopressin-epinephrine and methylprednisolone during resuscitation and stress-dose hydrocortisone in postresuscitation shock improved survival in refractory in-hospital cardiac arrest.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00411879.\n## Response:\n"}

Week 12\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Because of the progressive nature of the disease, most patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus eventually require multiple treatments to achieve glycaemic targets. The majority of available therapies are insulin dependent, aiming to decrease insulin resistance and increase insulin secretion. Sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, a new class of antidiabetic agents, limit renal glucose reabsorption promoting urinary excretion of glucose, thereby reducing plasma glucose.\nOBJECTIVE: This article explores the mechanism of action and clinical data surrounding SGLT2 inhibitors, with a particular focus on dapagli-flozin.\nCONCLUSION: Clinical trials have shown dapagliflozin to be effective in reducing glycosylated haemoglobin, weight and fasting plasma glucose, either as monotherapy or as add-on therapy to metformin, sulphonylurea and insulin.

Participants were randomized into two groups: The Paula Method exercise group (intervention group) and the control group. Women in the intervention group performed circular muscle exercises according to the Paula Method and received standard care, while those in the control group were treated only with standard care. Time to first bowel sounds, passage of first flatus and first defecation after CD were measured.\nRESULTS: A significant difference was found in the time to passage of first flatus, in favour of the intervention group (24.07 [6.85] hours versus 39.07 [10.37] hours; p\u00a0<\u00a0.001). No significant differences between the groups were found for other main outcome measures.\nCONCLUSION: Paula Method exercises post CD can serve as natural and convenient alternative to the standard, conservative treatment to promote resumption of GI activity.\nIMPACT: CD can be associated with postoperative ineffective peristalsis that can lead to a paralytic ileus. Since standard methods are not sufficient for all women, there is a need for alternative modalities to accelerate the resumption of bowel functioning. In the Paula Method exercise group, time to first flatus passage occurred significantly sooner compared with the control group. Time to first defecation was earlier in the Paula Method exercise group but this difference did not reach statistical significance. Along with gum chewing, Paula Method exercises can be part of a simple and inexpensive GI activation strategy post CD. Further research should be performed using these exercises post other operative procedures.\n## Response:\n"}

This study investigated whether cigarette demand predicted response to contingent monetary rewards for abstinence among individuals with substance use disorders. It also sought to replicate evidence for greater price sensitivity at whole-dollar pack price transitions (ie, left-digit effects).\nMETHODS: Participants (N = 338) were individuals in residential substance use disorder treatment who participated in a randomized controlled trial that compared contingent vouchers to noncontingent vouchers for smoking abstinence. Baseline demand indices were used to predict number of abstinent days during the 14-day voucher period (after the reduction lead-in) and at 1 and 3 months afterward.\nRESULTS: Demand indices correlated with measures of smoking and nicotine dependence. As measured by elasticity, intensity and O max, higher demand significantly predicted fewer abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings during voucher period for individuals in the noncontingent vouchers condition. Breakpoint exhibited a trend-level association with abstinent exhaled carbon monoxide readings. Demand indices did not predict abstinence in the contingent vouchers group, and did not predict abstinence at 1- and 3-month follow-ups. Left-digit price transitions were associated with significantly greater reductions in consumption.\nCONCLUSIONS: The association of cigarette demand with smoking behavior only in the group for whom abstinence was not incentivized indicates that CPT assesses the value of smoking more than the value of money per se and that vouchers counteract the effects of the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes. Results provide initial short-term evidence of predictive validity for the CPT indices.\nIMPLICATIONS: This study provides the first evidence of the validity of the CPT for predicting early response to brief advice for smoking cessation plus nicotine replacement in smokers with substance dependence. However, demand for cigarettes did not predict voucher-based treatment response, indicating that incentives serve as a powerful motivator not to smoke that acts in opposition to the intrinsic reinforcing value of cigarettes and that the indices reflect the value of smoking more than the value of money per se.\n## Response:\n"}

Radiological scans were performed every 12 weeks during the first year and every 24 weeks during the second year\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Somatostatin analogues are commonly used to treat symptoms associated with hormone hypersecretion in neuroendocrine tumors; however, data on their antitumor effects are limited.\nMETHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational study of the somatostatin analogue lanreotide in patients with advanced, well-differentiated or moderately differentiated, nonfunctioning, somatostatin receptor-positive neuroendocrine tumors of grade 1 or 2 (a tumor proliferation index [on staining for the Ki-67 antigen] of <10%) and documented disease-progression status. The tumors originated in the pancreas, midgut, or hindgut or were of unknown origin. Patients were randomly assigned to receive an extended-release aqueous-gel formulation of lanreotide (Autogel [known in the United States as Depot], Ipsen) at a dose of 120 mg (101 patients) or placebo (103 patients) once every 28 days for 96 weeks. The primary end point was progression-free survival, defined as the time to disease progression (according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.0) or death. Secondary end points included overall survival, quality of life (assessed with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer questionnaires QLQ-C30 and QLQ-GI.NET21), and safety.\nRESULTS: Most patients (96%) had no tumor progression in the 3 to 6 months before randomization, and 33% had hepatic tumor volumes greater than 25%. Lanreotide, as compared with placebo, was associated with significantly prolonged progression-free survival (median not reached vs. median of 18.0 months, P<0.001 by the stratified log-rank test; hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.30 to 0.73). The estimated rates of progression-free survival at 24 months were 65.1% (95% CI, 54.0 to 74.1) in the lanreotide group and 33.0% (95% CI, 23.0 to 43.3) in the placebo group. The therapeutic effect in predefined subgroups was generally consistent with that in the overall population, with the exception of small subgroups in which confidence intervals were wide. There were no significant between-group differences in quality of life or overall survival. The most common treatment-related adverse event was diarrhea (in 26% of the patients in the lanreotide group and 9% of those in the placebo group).\nCONCLUSIONS: Lanreotide was associated with significantly prolonged progression-free survival among patients with metastatic enteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors of grade 1 or 2 (Ki-67 <10%).

Patients with HCV genotype 1, 2, 4, or 6 were randomly assigned in a 5:1 ratio to receive the nucleotide polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir and the NS5A inhibitor velpatasvir in a once-daily, fixed-dose combination tablet or matching placebo for 12 weeks. Because of the low prevalence of genotype 5 in the study regions, patients with genotype 5 did not undergo randomization but were assigned to the sofosbuvir-velpatasvir group. The primary end point was a sustained virologic response at 12 weeks after the end of therapy.\nRESULTS: Of the 624 patients who received treatment with sofosbuvir-velpatasvir, 34% had HCV genotype 1a, 19% genotype 1b, 17% genotype 2, 19% genotype 4, 6% genotype 5, and 7% genotype 6. A total of 8% of patients were black, 19% had cirrhosis, and 32% had been previously treated for HCV. The rate of sustained virologic response among patients receiving sofosbuvir-velpatasvir was 99% (95% confidence interval, 98 to >99). Two patients receiving sofosbuvir-velpatasvir, both with HCV genotype 1, had a virologic relapse. None of the 116 patients receiving placebo had a sustained virologic response. Serious adverse events were reported in 15 patients (2%) in the sofosbuvir-velpatasvir group and none in the placebo group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Once-daily sofosbuvir-velpatasvir for 12 weeks provided high rates of sustained virologic response among both previously treated and untreated patients infected with HCV genotype 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6, including those with compensated cirrhosis.
